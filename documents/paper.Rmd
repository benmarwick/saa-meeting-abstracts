# Introduction

The study of disciplinary change traditionally relies on close reading of a large number of publications, manually sorting them into pre-defined categories and making connections between these groups and external influences [e.g. @trigger1989history]. These methods are time-consuming and expensive, which excludes many people from participating. They are also vulnerable to biases     

computational approaches that could scan the entire corpus to generate topics in a bottom-up fashion, based on the semantic content of the publications themselves. These approaches indeed make it possible to analyze more comprehensively and more systematically the contents of large corpora of full-text documents, be it in history and sociology 




# Background

- previous efforts at the history of archaeology (e.g. Bruce Trigger's book)
- previous efforts at text analysis in archaeology (e.g. bibliometrics, citation networks)

# Methods

- source of the data
We collected abstracts from Society of American Archaeology (SAA) annual meeting programs from 1964 to 2020. The total number of abstracts are 68,176 from 40 annual meetings excluding some years without available abstracts. The source of abstract includes papers, posters, workshop posters, symposium represented by paragraphs. The annual programs are available online at https://www.saa.org/annual-meeting/annual-meeting-archives/program-archives. The original format of abstracts on websites includes scanned images for early years and accessible PDF after 2004.
