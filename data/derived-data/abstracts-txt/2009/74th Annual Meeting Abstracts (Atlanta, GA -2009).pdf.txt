                                      SYMPOSIUM ABSTRACTS
[1] SYMPOSIUM ■ ARCHAEOLOGY BEYOND ARCHAEOLOGY
Advances in archaeological methods and the expansion of fieldwork around the world have led to
an enormous growth in data and interpretations about past human societies. Although the new
findings have implications for many disciplines outside of archaeology, these connections remain
poorly explored. Scholars in other disciplines find it difficult to navigate the specialist literature in
archaeology, and archaeologists have made only limited attempts to present their data for
outsiders. The participants in this symposium show how archaeologists can contribute to wider
realms of scholarship in the historical, social, and natural sciences.

[5] SYMPOSIUM ■ THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF ARCHAEOLOGY: DIGGING UP OLD COLLECTIONS
In the Principles of Archaeological Ethics of the SAA, preservation of archaeological materials
and their accompanying records is important enough to warrant its own section (Principle 7). The
use of these collections justifies their collection and curation, but often archaeologists are steered
away from working on existing collections because such projects are less prestigious than those
that require excavation of new materials. Collections research also carries with it difficulties in
terms of access, poor preservation, and lack of accompanying documentation. The papers in this
session will focus on the challenges and benefits of doing research on extant collections of
artifacts.
[6] SYMPOSIUM ■ NEW PERSPECTIVES ON OLD ISSUES IN MAYA STUDIES
The continuing growth and advancement of Maya studies has highlighted many problematic,
though widespread, issues in the scholarly literature on the topic. We are now in the position to
develop increasing specificity in the vocabulary we use and the viewpoints we adopt. This
session will introduce several case studies that reevaluate and augment established methods of
studying ancient Maya culture and the material record. Participants will apply new perspectives to
traditional approaches, reanalyze commonly used terminology, and reconsider frequently
accepted concepts.
[7] FORUM ■ TOWARD A NEW CURRICULUM: THE FUTURE OF APPLIED ARCHAEOLOGY IN HIGHER
Education
(SPONSORED BY SAA COMMITTEE ON CURRICULUM)
Demand is increasing for curricula that prepare students for careers in applied archaeology,
defined as the application of archaeological research and results to contemporary human
problems such as cultural resource management, heritage tourism, human/environment
dynamics, and public education. This forum brings together experts from all over the world who
will draw on their own experiences with archaeology education in and beyond academia to
assess the “Recommended Model Curriculum for a Master’s in Applied Archaeology,” created by
the SAA Committee on Curriculum. The objective of this forum is to promote international dialog
and explore the diverse paths along which such curricula might proceed.
[8] SYMPOSIUM ■ ARCHAEOLOGIES OF ANXIETY
This session addresses the archaeological study of anxiety, and aims to explore the shifting role
that such states as fear, apprehension, and worry played in the constitution, reproduction, and
transformation of social life. Papers will examine personal, subjective anxiety realized through
daily practice, as well as the agitation and concern that comes from class or factional struggle,
warfare, environmental degradation, and personal turmoil. Papers will address the material
dimension of rites and performances related to the mitigation and negotiation of anxiety as well as
the role of material culture in constituting periods or episodes of anxiety.

[11] SYMPOSIUM ■ RECENT RESEARCH ON MESOPOTAMIAN URBANISM: ORIGINS, STRUCTURE,
ECONOMY
Recent years have seen interesting developments in the study of Mesopotamian cities. In
northern Mesopotamia (modern NE Syria and SE Turkey), fieldwork is increasingly directed
toward large questions of structure and demography, patterns of growth, subsistence and political
economy, administration, and social organization. For southern Mesopotamia, archaeological
research has employed new methods and innovative use of old datasets, particularly remote
sensing and agent-based modeling. This session will highlight recent research from urban origins
to the capitals of empires, and to introduce it to a broader audience of scholars of early urbanism
via a comparative perspective.
[12] SYMPOSIUM ■ RECENT ADVANCES AT TIWANAKU, BOLIVIA: MOLLO KONTU'S JACH'A MARKA
PROJECT
For centuries (ca. AD 500-1100), Tiwanaku was the ceremonial and political core of a prehispanic
state centered in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Bolivia. Recent research has suggested that the
capital city of Tiwanaku comprised various social groups differentiated by socioeconomic status
and/or ethnic or ethnic-like affiliation. Excavations, surveys, and on-going laboratory analyses in
the Mollo Kontu sector of the site have generated data to further explore these hypotheses. This
session presents the preliminary findings from Mollo Kontu domestic and mortuary contexts,
which are contributing to our understanding of urban life and death in this Tiwanaku
neighborhood.
[13] SYMPOSIUM ■ TECHNOLOGY AS PRACTICE: POLYCHROME AND GLAZE-PAINTED POTTERY IN THE
LATE PREHISPANIC AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
Polychrome and glaze-painted pottery characterized by similarities in color schemes, painting
techniques, design layouts and decorative motifs are a hallmark of communities in the American
Southwest from the late 13th through 17th centuries. The origin, spread and demise of these
traditions occurred within contexts of massive demographic upheavals and social change.
Participants in this symposium use new data to contextualize the social conditions under which
polychrome and glaze-paint technologies were adopted as well as conditions under which they
went out of use. These studies provide a window into processes of culture change among the late
prehispanic and early colonial Pueblos.
[14] SYMPOSIUM ■ INDIANS IN CAROLINA 1600-1860: RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Recent investigations of Carolina Indian sites permit examination of the role of Native groups in
the development of the colony/state(s). Indians were integral to the success of Carolina. Trade in
deer skins and slaves drove the early economy; the deer skin trade continued to be important
throughout the 18th century. Coastal Indians provided land and foodstuffs to fledging settlements.
The Yamasee dominated Indian slave trade, and provided military support against the Spanish
and other Indian groups. The Catawba and Cherokee became established partners with the
colonial/state governments. Recent research highlights the effects of Indian/colonist interactions
on Native culture and society.
[15] SYMPOSIUM ■ NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MOCHE WARFARE
The last two decades have witnessed exciting new developments in Moche archaeology, and
new research has compelled scholars to reevaluate previously accepted models of Moche
political organization. One important subject that stands to benefit from further academic
discussion is the sociopolitical significance of Moche warfare. Previous studies have debated
whether archaeological signatures of warfare and ubiquitous iconographic depictions of battle are
best interpreted in terms of mythological norms, as ritual contests, as "secular" conflicts, or a
combination of ceremonial and strategic combat. Recent bioarchaeological analysis has also
shed light on how militarism may have mediated Moche identity politics and inter-polity relations.
The symposium will mobilize a diverse array of perspectives to determine how archaeological
analyses of warfare can improve knowledge of Moche political structure, social control, elite
culture, religious institutions, ideologies of alterity, and historical change. Ultimately, a
consideration of the particulars of Moche warfare should advance theoretical understanding of the
intimate relationships linking political hierarchy with violence, religion, and militarism in past
societies.
[16] SYMPOSIUM ■ SETTLING SOME ISSUES: PERSPECTIVES ON SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AND
PASTORALISM IN PREHISTORY
Pastoralist studies in archaeology focus primarily on data gathered from mortuary and ritual
contexts to model socioeconomic and political organization. As such, settlement/habitation data
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING                                                          3
have largely been relegated to the background of research on pastoralism in prehistory. This
session aims to bring these data center stage and to provide an outlet for the presentation of
comparative research on ancient pastoralist social, economic and political organization. To do
this, a variety of case studies are offered, highlighting the complex nature of how and why
territory is occupied and exploited by pastoralists from the Peruvian Andes to the steppe
grasslands in Mongolia.
[17] SYMPOSIUM ■ MOUNDS, TOWNS, THEORIES, AND NUMBERS: CELEBRATING THE CAREER OF
CHRISTOPHER S. PEEBLES
Throughout his career, Chris Peebles has integrated sophisticated theoretical perspectives with
the most modern technology, while never losing sight of the fundamental importance and joy of
field archaeology. From his well-known work at Moundville through his role as director of the
Glenn A. Black Laboratory at Indiana University, he has inspired his students as he converted
them to colleagues. The diverse papers in this session show how Chris' influence extends far
beyond "a very small patch of the past" in Alabama. They also celebrate and emulate the great
respect for him that he has consistently shown for his own inspirators.
[18] POSTER SESSION ■ SOUTHWEST POSTER SESSION
[19] SYMPOSIUM ■ INVESTIGATIONS IN THE CUPUL REGION OF THE NORTHERN MAYA LOWLANDS: THE
XUENKAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT
Four seasons of archaeological field research at Xuenkal have documented the history of a polity
that was settled by the Late Preclassic (300 B.C. – A.D. 300) and occupied continuously through
most of the Classic period (A.D. 300 – 1000). Xuenkal’s occupation is spatially continuous and
expansive in the transition from the Early Classic to Late Classic periods, when the settlement
reached its apogee. A primary goal of the project is to understand the impact of Chichén Itzá on
other settlements in the Cupul region, and in turn to investigate the role that inhabitants of
Xuenkal and the surrounding hinterlands played in the regional economy. A substantial Terminal
Classic occupation containing high percentages (90-99%) of Sotuta sphere ceramics –and a
change in settlement pattern from dispersed residences to freestanding platforms supporting
multiple residential structures -- associates the site with Chichén Itzá and distinguishes it from
other major centers in the northern Maya Lowlands during this time. This session will present
results of household excavations with associated craft production areas, regional mapping and
reconnaissance.
[20] SYMPOSIUM ■ ARCHAEOLOGY OF PUEBLA-TLAXCALA
The session brings together investigators who study the prehistory and history of the Puebla-
Tlaxcala region using archaeological evidence. This area has a rich but as yet poorly understood
culture history and played an important role in the social and political developments of both the
pre-and post-Conquest periods. In order to foster communication and promote interest in the
region, a variety of investigators will share their latest work and set the stage for future
cooperation and collaboration.
[21] SYMPOSIUM ■ INTERACTION AND DOMAINS IN SOUTH ASIA AND THE OLD WORLD: PAPERS IN
HONOR OF GREGORY L. POSSEHL
For over 35 years Gregory L. Possehl has conducted extensive archaeological research in the
Quetta Valley, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Oman. His original research, compilation and synthesis of
separate site reports and notations lead to broader understanding of the Indus Civilization and
interaction across South, Central, and West Asia. Possehl's concept of domains explains both
variation and coherence in material culture across the Indus. His model of third millennium Middle
Asian Interaction Sphere (MAIS) is supported by evidence at multiple sites. Papers in this session
present contemporary research influenced by Possehl's work ranging from ceramic comparisons
to pastoralism to paleoanthropology.
[22] Forum ■ CULTURALLY UNIDENTIFIABLE HUMAN REMAINS POLICY: WHAT IS AT STAKE FOR
ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND NATIVE PEOPLES?
(SPONSORED BY INDIGENOUS PERSON'S INTEREST GROUP)
The subject of Culturally Unidentifiable Human Remains (CUHR) has long been a source of
concern for both Native Americans and archaeologists. Few subjects have demonstrated the
divergent interests of Native Americans and archaeologists as stakeholders as the determination
of human remains as “Culturally Identifiable”. We hope to address three main questions: 1) How
are changes in the proposed regulation likely to impact archaeological research? 2) How are
, 4                                      ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING
determinations of “unidentied” arrived at and how do they affect Indigenous Peoples? 3) What is
at stake for each group? This forum will discuss these difficult questions from a variety of practical
and theoretical perspectives.

[27] SYMPOSIUM ■ INVESTIGATIONS AT CERRO JAZMIN, MIXTECA ALTA, OAXACA
This session showcases recent finds from the Cerro Jazmin Archaeological Project. The project,
the first to focus on the site of Cerro Jazmin, incorporates mapping, intensive archaeological and
geomorphological survey to investigate Prehispanic highland urbanism, its structure and
longevity, and its immediate environmental impact on the surrounding landscape throughout the
Prehispanic sequence.
[28] SYMPOSIUM ■ FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY: A MULTI-DISCIPLINARY APPROACH
Forensic Archaeology is the application of archaeological techniques to the investigation of
criminal activity and/or medico legal issues. By its very nature forensic archaeology draws into
itself a wide range of disciplines, experiences, and skills. Many forensic archaeological
practitioners are also versed in other forensic techniques as diverse as fingerprinting, physical
anthropology, entomology, and the environmental sciences to name a few. The aim of this
symposium is to explore the multi-disciplinary approach to forensic archaeology. Through case
studies, past and present research, the papers presented will explore the diverse skill-set
necessary to those active in the field.
[29] POSTER SESSION ■ WESTERN US POSTER SESSION
[30] SYMPOSIUM ■ SECOND IMPRESSIONS: ALTERNATIVE METHODS FOR EXPLORING ARCHAEOLOGICAL
PERISHABLES
(SPONSORED BY FIBER PERISHABLES INTEREST GROUP)
Perishable artifacts are ephemeral, and infrequently represented in the universe of archaeological
sites. As perishables research advances, analysts are exploring a veritable new frontier of
techniques for the study of perishable artifacts and traditions. A slew of analytical techniques may
greatly expand what researchers know about the perishable artifacts from various regions and
cultures even where the traditionally focused on perishable artifacts, namely textiles or baskets,
are not preserved for direct observation. This expanded analytical base includes but is not limited
to: employing technologies or computer-based software for anything from a myriad of artifact-
specific analyses to regionally specific distributional analyses; chemical analyses of organic
residues where they are present on more durable artifacts; an expansion of the types of
perishable artifacts considered for physical analyses to include composite artifacts with an
organic component; and, indirect analyses through impressions or casts of textiles or baskets, or
their portrayal in other media, such as carvings, sculptures, paintings, or murals. The aim of this
symposium is to bring these methods and techniques into focus and to consider what they have
to offer perishables research as well as more general historical and archaeological pursuits.
[31] Poster Session ■ Sharing Archaeology with the Public: Examples from the Homol'ovi
Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program
(SPONSORED BY PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE)
Sharing archaeology with the public is uniformly recognized as important but limited opportunities
exist in research and academic settings for students to learn the skills necessary to communicate
archaeological information with general audiences. As part of the Homol'ovi Undergraduate
Research Opportunities Program (HUROP), undergraduate students participated in
archaeological field research in a field school setting while also learning to interpret archaeology
to visitors at the Homol'ovi Ruins State Park in northeastern Arizona. This session highlights the
important interpretive and educational opportunities created by integrating fieldwork with public
outreach with posters summarizing students’ outreach projects.
[32] Poster Session ■ NEW RESEARCH IN THE CASAS GRANDES WORLD
Eighty-five years ago, Alfred V. Kidder described the Casas Grandes culture in his seminal
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING                                                             5
Introduction to Southwestern Archaeology. Over eight decades of research has produced a vast
wealth of data; most impressively (though not exclusively) Di Peso and colleagues’ massive
report of the Joint Casas Grandes Expedition. Despite the available empirical evidence, much
about the Casas Grandes culture remains unknown. Posters in this session examine new and old
data in order to explore different aspects of this unique prehistoric culture.
[33] POSTER SESSION ■ INVESTIGATIONS IN A GHOST TOWN: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF HERMOSA, NEW
MEXICO
In summer 2008 a joint team of students from Howard University, Indiana University of
Pennsylvania, and the Mescalero Apache Reservation investigated the ghost town of Hermosa,
NM, and its environs. Published accounts suggested that the town, founded in 1883 during New
Mexico’s silver mining boom, was largely abandoned by 1910. Survey and excavations, however,
revealed a palimpsest of different occupations in Hermosa and the surrounding valley, from
ancient to modern. These student posters discuss the methods used to uncover the ghost town’s
past and the results of this first year of investigations.
[34] POSTER SESSION ■ CULTURAL PATHWAYS THROUGH WESTERN COLORADO
The numerous drainages that cross the Piceance Basin of western Colorado made that area a
pathway for human movement and settlement from the Archaic through Historic times. Seemingly
most intensively inhabited during the Late Prehistoric and Protohistoric periods, this area provides
abundant evidence for material exchanges and cultural transitions that resulted from the
immigration of new groups and the displacement or transformation of existing groups. The papers
in this symposium explore diverse lines of material evidence—including lithic artifacts, personal
adornments, structural forms, and site distributions—for human mobility and interaction, as well
as resulting cultural transformation.

[37] SYMPOSIUM ■ DOLLARS AND SENSE IN RECOVERING AND MANAGING ARCHEOLOGICAL
COLLECTIONS
(SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON MUSEUMS, COLLECTIONS, AND CURATION)
Archaeological collections, including artifacts, records and reports, are part of the irreplaceable
archaeological record, yet are in constant jeopardy of loss and inaccessibility. One reason is
because the costs to recover and manage collections are significant, but often poorly understood
and budgeted. Field project budgets often do not cover the expenses of analysis, conservation,
and curation. Repositories struggle for resources for long-term collection preservation and
accessibility. This session examines the real costs and issues involved in managing collections,
from the field to the repository. Cost efficient practices are critical if collections are to remain
viable data sources for future use.
[38] SYMPOSIUM ■ RECENT INVESTIGATIONS ON THE SACRED PRECINCT OF TENOCHTITLAN: THE
SEVENTH FIELD SEASON OF THE PROYECTO TEMPLO MAYOR
The fortuitous discovery of the Tlaltecuhtli Earth Goddess monolith in 2006 generated new
investigations in the ruins of Tenochtitlan's sacred precinct. Since March 2007, an
interdisciplinary and international team organized by the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e
Historia has carried out topographic studies, geophysical prospection, microchemical analysis,
and archaeological excavation in Mexico City's historic center. These activities have produced
new data regarding the precinct's urban planning, the architectural and functional evolution of its
religious structures, and the symbolism and economy of Mexica rituals carried out at the foot of
the Templo Mayor in the decades prior to Spanish Conquest.
[39] SYMPOSIUM ■ COMPLEXITY AND TECHNOLOGY IN SOUTH ASIA AND THE OLD WORLD: PAPERS IN
HONOR OF GREGORY L. POSSEHL
For over 35 years Gregory L. Possehl has conducted extensive archaeological research in the
Quetta Valley, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Oman. His original research, compilation, and synthesis of
separate site reports and notations have led to a broader understanding of the Indus Civilization
and complexity in the Old World. By contextualizing the Indus as a complex society without the
necessary structures of the state, Possehl has refocused attention on key aspects of complexity,
such as the various forms of technology. This session presents contemporary research projects
that have been influenced by and have responded to Possehl's work in these areas.

[40] SYMPOSIUM ■ TRACING TRAILS & MODELING MOVEMENT: UNDERSTANDING PAST CULTURAL
LANDSCAPES AND SOCIAL NETWORKS THROUGH LEAST-COST ANALYSIS
The advent of powerful Geographic Information Science (GIS) software packages and the
increasing availability of inexpensive or free digital geospatial data have made it possible for
archaeologists to ask sophisticated questions about how and why agents traveled through and
interacted with their surroundings. In particular, questions regarding how agents potentially
defined and dealt with "cost" as a factor in travel are becoming much easier to address via GIS
applications that utilize Least-Cost Analysis techniques. These methods leverage complex and
dynamic agent-oriented relationships between the natural and cultural features of a landscape in
order to model pathways or corridors of movement.

[42] SYMPOSIUM ■ RETHINKING MOUNDVILLE AND ITS HINTERLAND: PAPERS IN HONOR OF
CHRISTOPHER S. PEEBLES
For over 30 years Moundville has played a pivotal role in discussions of chiefdoms and
Mississippian societies. Research inaugurated by Christopher Peebles laid the foundations for
models of the development, economic organization, and social arrangements of the Moundville
polity. Recent work in the Black Warrior Valley has both refined and contested these models. The
papers in this symposium employ new data and perspectives to reflect on Moundville and its
hinterland. The picture that emerges builds on previous work but is more detailed and
ethnohistorically grounded than its predecessors.
[43] SYMPOSIUM · ON SACRED GROUND: THE LIFE HISTORY OF A PLACE AND ITS PEOPLE
Statistical Research, Inc. was contracted by Pima County, Arizona to completely excavate in
seventeen months a complex 4.2-acre multi-component site in downtown Tucson. The project
area includes a Late Archaic residential locus, a historical-period cemetery of over 1100
individuals, and numerous residential or commercial features that intrude or cap the cemetery.
Our multidisciplinary team applies cutting-edge technology and new methodologies to investigate
major research issues: long-term change in land use and social values, the mortuary practice and
bioarchaeology of an ethnically-mixed 19th century population, and 20th century urban
development. How are we doing it and what are we learning?
[44] SYMPOSIUM ■ LITHIC TECHNOLOGICAL SYSTEMS: EVOLUTIONARY APPROACHES TO
UNDERSTANDING STONE TECHNOLOGIES AS A BYPRODUCT OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR
Developing methodologically and theoretically informed models of lithic technological organization
is crucial to understanding how humans procured, made, and used stone for tools. Recently it has
become apparent that while current models have strong methodological and experimental foci,
theory is not well incorporated. A promising solution to this problem is the integration of
evolutionary theory to view lithic technological systems as a byproduct of human behavior; largely
a result of cultural transmission and decision making practices. By exploring this relationship,
significant new insights may be gained in understanding the human behavioral components that
influence the organization of lithic technological systems.
[45] SYMPOSIUM ■ THERE ARE TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY: INDIGENOUS RESPONSES AND
MOTIVATIONS IN THE PERIPHERIES OF STATE-LEVEL POLITIES DURING THE MIDDLE HORIZON
Examination of Middle Horizon state expansion in the Andes has largely focused upon colonial
control strategies in peripheral territories ignoring responses by indigenous populations to foreign
influences into their territory. This symposium brings together research throughout the central
Andes that focuses on local reactions to primarily Wari and Tiwanaku expansion during the
Middle Horizon, exploring a range of strategies to cope with these foreign influences.
Understanding these local perspectives and responses is essential to develop more complete
models for the expansion of the major Middle Horizon polities.
[46] SYMPOSIUM ■ STILL DIGGING: OUR FOURTH DECADE OF ARCHAEOLOGY ON ST. CATHERINES
ISLAND (GEORGIA)
The American Museum of Natural History has been conducting archaeological investigations on
St. Catherines Island for four decades and the digging continues. Current research objectives
emphasize community patterning, subsistence and technology at the temporal extremes of the
earliest (Late Archaic) and the latest (late prehistoric and mission periods) aboriginal occupations
on the island. These papers summarize some of the on-going research objectives and frame the
research design for present and future fieldwork.

[47] SYMPOSIUM ■ EMERGING ARCHAEOLOGY OF BAJA CALIFORNIA: CHALLENGING PARADIGMS OF
ISOLATION AND MARGINALITY
Current research originating in Baja California challenges outdated paradigms that present the
peninsula as uncomplicated in its ecological and cultural landscape. Instead of viewing the
peninsula as home to isolated human populations struggling for existence in a marginal land,
current research considers how the history and prehistory of Baja California has shaped – and
has been shaped by – its particular geographic, geomorphological, demographic, environmental,
and social characteristics. Robust prehistoric and historic records of Baja California built from
terrestrial and underwater sites provide new insights on important anthropological issues of
migration, colonization, interaction networks, behavioral and historical ecology, cultural
complexity and missionization.
[48] SYMPOSIUM ■ RETHINKING GARBAGE IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD: THEORETICAL
PERSPECTIVES AND CASE STUDIES FROM THE MAYA REGION
Western concepts of garbage as unwanted production detritus, food remains and broken objects
pervade archaeological interpretations. These tropes are so widespread that artifacts, particularly
in construction fill and middens, are deemed de facto refuse. So-called termination deposits,
problematic deposits, reused artifacts, monuments, and architecture can, however, often
confound accepted wisdom. Aside from potential ritual and symbolic implications of "refuse" in
Mesoamerica, contemporary notions of recycling and reuse mandate an operational and
theoretical overhaul of how we characterize Prehispanic trash. Historically, emphasis has been
on behavioral aspects of waste disposal, but the proposed rethinking includes semiotic,
interpretive, and practice-based theories.

KNOWLEDGE IN CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE INTERPRETATION
(SPONSORED BY NATIONAL GUARD BUREAU)
Recent SAA efforts and publications recognize and debate the value of indigenous knowledge in
archaeological interpretation. The March 2007 issue of the SAA Archaeological Record was a
thematic issue dealing with indigenous knowledge and 21st century archaeological practice. As
the introductory article pointed out, traditional knowledge is quickly disappearing and we need to
document it before it is lost. The papers included in this symposium share examples from across
the United States of lessons learned and knowledge gained as a result of Native American
consultation, ethnographic research, and tribal contributions in the realm of cultural resource
management and archaeological investigations.
[52] POSTER SESSION ■ RECONSIDERING THE MONONGAHELA: NEW VIEWPOINTS ON THE
ARCHAEOLOGY OF WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
Archaeologists defined the Late Prehistoric Monongahela culture in western Pennsylvania in the
1930s, but recent approaches are generating new understanding of the chronology, subsistence,
and settlement patterns. These new perspectives have developed both from the reconsideration
of previously excavated sites and from the discovery of new sites in the region. Posters in this
session report on a variety of recent projects involving new technologies such as geophysics and
geospatial mapping or on projects that have utilized more traditional archaeological data sets to
arrive at new interpretations. Together these research projects suggest new directions for the
study of the Monongahela.

public education in archaeology? Who is doing it and where? How are professionals trained (what
academic institutions accommodate students interested and how)? What is its theoretical
foundation and how does it inform practice? What is best practice? This forum will consider these
questions in order to evaluate the “state-of-the-state” in public education in archaeology and
advocate for its future.
[58] SYMPOSIUM ■ INNOVATIVE ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES IN COASTAL GUATEMALAN ARCHAEOLOGY
The session will present multiple projects incorporating geophysical and archeochemistry
techniques to answer specific questions regarding areas of archaeological interest in Pacific
Coastal Guatemala. Presenters will discuss projects including obsidian sourcing using LA-ICP-
MS, paleoenvironmental recreation using various techniques including thermoluminescence
dating and IC-PMS on a sediment core from the mangroves of coastal Guatemala, gpr mapping
of a large late classic urban complex, the integration of multiple geophysical surveys, artifact
distribution, and soil analysis in ArcGIS, source analysis of Plumbate pottery from La Blanca
using ICP-MS, and the use of GPR to locate subsurface features associated with a large
Formative period mound subjected to extensive modern disturbance.
[59] FORUM ■ STUDENTS PRESENT! HOW TO PREPARE AND DELIVER A SUCCESSFUL PAPER
(SPONSORED BY STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE)
As students are molded into young professionals, they are told that it is their responsibility to
conduct research, as well as publish, and present their findings before of an audience of their
peers. Presentations are perhaps the most intimidating of these career-building requirements,
and possibly also the area in which most students receive the least amount of guidance. This
forum (sponsored by the Student Affairs Committee) is designed to provide an introduction to
successful presenting. We will cover basic rules for talking in front of an audience and provide
tips for staying on topic, keeping your talk interesting and informative, and using PowerPoint and
other visual aides. We invite students and young professionals to come with questions and
advice. This will be an interactive forum that allows the participants to focus the discussion in
whatever direction is most helpful for them.
[60] SYMPOSIUM ■ COASTAL ANDEAN POLITICAL INNOVATION AND TRANSFORMATION: THE MIDDLE
HORIZON TO LATE INTERMEDIATE PERIOD TRANSITION ON THE NORTH CENTRAL COAST
During the Middle Horizon-Late Intermediate Period transition, the north central coast of Peru is a
place of great interpolity interaction, political upheaval, restructuring and in some cases,
continued stability. The variability seen in the formation and development of Middle Horizon and
Late Intermediate Period coastal polities is visible in the presence of cultural innovations in
pottery, architecture and mortuary practices. Recent research is identifying these features and
transforming our understanding of this period on the north central coast, revealing a newly
defined landscape of political, ideological, and economic structures among neighboring polities.
[61] SYMPOSIUM ■ CROSSING THE POND: COMPARATIVE STUDIES OF MIGRATION, IDENTITY, AND
MATERIAL CULTURE IN THE U.S. SOUTHWEST AND MEDIEVAL EUROPE
This session is focused on migration, identity formation, and the role that material culture plays in
these processes. Our goal is to bring together researchers working in two divergent scholarly
traditions and world regions who approach these issues with different theoretical frameworks and
methods. Both the prehistoric U.S. Southwest and post-Roman Europe are characterized by
frequent and widespread migration which led to broad social changes that we observe through
material culture. By bringing together scholars from these different regions we hope to foster new
collaborations and spread ideas between archaeological traditions that do not commonly interact.
[62] SYMPOSIUM ■ CHARTING THE LIFE HISTORIES OF ARTIFACTS AND GOODS IN EAST           ASIAN
PREHISTORY AND HISTORY
In recent decades, attempts by archaeologists to chart the life histories of artifacts and goods
over time and space have been accompanied by novel perspectives into the social and political
forces associated with such transformations. Focusing on East Asia, this symposium's case
studies underscore the fact that antiquity and long-term constancy in political and philosophical
forms in no way preclude the possibility of important shifts in the meaning and function of artifacts
and goods. Significantly, these papers also point the way to artifact-based approaches that have
yet to play a significant role in investigations of past societies in East Asia.
[63] SYMPOSIUM ■ EURASIAN LANDSCAPES: OLD WORLD PERSPECTIVES ON MOBILITY, POWER, AND
SYMBOL
Research in the Old World has remained at the theoretical and methodological fore of regionally

based approaches in both the Mediterranean and across Eurasia. This symposium brings
together scholars studying agrarian, pastoral, and complex societies to review current and past
trends in landscape archaeology. By emphasizing the production of landscape, power, and
symbol, papers may explore previously unidentified cross cultural trends in the human use of
space from across the Old World.
[64] GENERAL SESSION ■ ARCHITECTURE AND IDEOLOGY IN CLASSIC MAYA CENTERS
[65] SYMPOSIUM ■ RECONSTRUCTING THE NATURES OF COMMUNITIES IN THE INTERMEDIATE AREA
The variety of the interactions and affinities that connect households to each other, and to
broader social dynamics, are of analytical interest to anthropologists and archaeologists studying
the 'community'. Because social changes and continuities may be generated from these
relationships, understanding the activities, forms of social differentiation, and social ties within
and between communities are of critical importance. Contributors have chosen to examine
communities within the Intermediate Area, noted both for its cultural diversity and stability, and
assess what relevance a community focus has for themselves.
[66] SYMPOSIUM ■ OLD QUESTIONS, NEW APPROACHES: RECENT ANALYSES OF CHACO CANYON,
NEW MEXICO
The goal of this symposium is to address fundamental questions relevant to our understanding of
Chacoan prehistory. Using new data sets as well as new theoretical approaches and methods,
papers will focus on four main topics: structure diversity and function, craft specialization, human
remains, and subsistence. A series of recent publications have synthesized points of scholarly
agreement and highlighted remaining issues of contention and debate within the scholarly
community at large. Symposium participants will bring new data to bear on these persistent
questions in hopes of clarifying as-yet-unresolved issues fundamental to our understanding of this
fascinating chapter of southwestern prehistory.
[67] SYMPOSIUM ■ THE SUBTERRANEAN DISCIPLINE: CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE 21ST CENTURY
Humanity did not actually begin in caves, but it is no exaggeration to say that archaeology did.
Archaeologists have worked in caves from the earliest days of stratigraphic excavation, yet a true
international cave archaeology is only now emerging as a distinct sub-discipline. This session will
bring together researchers from around the world in order to showcase the diversity of
approaches to cave archaeology and the advances that are being made in the field. By
transcending regional boundaries, we hope to stimulate discussion of some of the fundamental
issues of the discipline as well as to articulate its future direction.
[68] GENERAL SESSION ■ IDENTITY AND ETHNICITY FORMATION IN THE MAYA AREA
[69] SYMPOSIUM ■ IME TEAM AMERICA: AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ARCHAEOLOGY BEHIND THE
PROGRAM
Time Team America: An Introduction to the Archaeology Behind the Program Archaeology has
been enjoying a great deal of exposure on television programs, but those programs focus almost
exclusively on sensational finds that reinforce the Indiana Jones image of archaeology. This
session is a look at Time Team America and its first season of programs. It focuses on
archaeological methods rather than sensationalizing the finds. These papers address various
aspects of the work carried out by the archaeologists involved. Excavation techniques,
geophysics, archaeobotany, historical research, and material culture analysis have all been
highlighted in the first season of filming.

TEXAS: A SAMPLE FROM FORT BLISS
In 2007, Statistical Research, Inc. (SRI) was awarded a 5-year contract for survey, evaluation,
and mitigation projects at Fort Bliss in the southern Southwest. In the first two years, SRI has
, 10                                     ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING
undertaken numerous projects that are adding to the already significant database of the Jornada
Mogollon region. In this session, authors discuss some of the more interesting sites and
landscape data collected from these projects, ranging from Archaic period logistically-used
campsites to early and late Formative period villages, to historic ranching sites. We summarize
the research and the historic contexts, and suggest new and further directions for this continuing
research.
[76] SYMPOSIUM ■ 2009 FRYXELL AWARD: MICHAEL D. GLASCOCK AND THE MURR ARCHAEOMETRY
LABORATORY
The Fryxell award is in many ways best served by recognizing someone from outside of
archaeology who has made major contributions to the field. For twenty years, Michael Glascock,
a nuclear physicist, has directed the Archaeometry Laboratory at MURR which is arguably one of
the most active and prolific archaeometry laboratories in existence. Under, Glascock's leadership,
data generated at MURR have led to many significant insights concerning past human and social
dynamics, especially on topics related to trade, migration, raw material consumption, social
interaction. Papers in this session acknowledge and explore the contributions of Dr. Glascock to
archaeology and interdisciplinary archaeological research.

[79] FORUM ■ INCREASING LOCAL PROTECTION FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES-ONE YEAR LATER
(SPONSORED BY GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE)
During last year's Annual Meeting the Government Affairs Committee hosted a forum on finding
effective ways to promote and strengthen local protections for archaeological resources, and how
SAA could contribute to that process. The forum was very productive in generating discussion
and the sharing of ideas. This year's forum will allow participants to review the progress that has
been made since the Vancouver event, and to discuss new ways of approaching this important
subject. The forum will also showcase several recent examples of archaeological research
conducted on the local level to highlight the achievement of local government archaeology
programs.
[80] SYMPOSIUM ■ REVISITING THE ETOWAH VALLEY: NEW DATA FROM 9CK1, THE LONG SWAMP SITE
In the late 1930s, Robert Wauchope conducted excavations at the Long Swamp site in Cherokee
County, Georgia. He located the remains of a prehistoric mound and village that contained Early
and Middle Woodland, Early through Late Mississippian, and protohistoric components. Most
recently, Edwards-Pitman, as part of a Georgia Department of Transportation bridge replacement
project, undertook a large-scale data recovery on another section of the site. A palisade,
structures, and numerous features were excavated during this fieldwork. This symposium will
explore our project's findings, including geomorphology, site organization, faunal and floral
remains and ceramic data and will describe how this new information contributes to our view of
Mississippian life in the Etowah Valley.
[81] SYMPOSIUM ■ BEING TIWANAKU: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON SOCIAL IDENTITY IN THE MIDDLE
HORIZON
Participation in Tiwanaku civilization was colored by a powerful and pervasive collective identity.
Yet for hundreds of thousands of people in the Middle Horizon, “being Tiwanaku” also meant
responding to a complex palette of ethnic, corporate, regional, gender, class, and family
affiliations. Recent settlement, household, mortuary and bio-archaeology in the Tiwanaku core
and diaspora has illuminated this intricate kaleidoscope of shared and particular social identities.
The papers presented in this symposium will consider the balance between the socially unifying
aspects of Tiwanaku culture and the pronounced and complex social diversity that led Luis
Lumbreras to paint the Tiwanaku as a “pueblo polichromo”.
[82] SYMPOSIUM ■ MEMPHIS TO MUMBAI: ARCHAEOLOGY INSPIRED BY R. BARRY LEWIS
The career and intellectual contributions, of R. Barry Lewis continue to inspire scholars and
influence anthropological research from the Americas to Southeast Asia. Although his formal
training and career focused in archaeology, the essence of Barry’s legacy incorporates the very
best of the four-field approach in anthropology. His contributions within archaeology include
subsistence practices, economic organization, the structure and organization of public space,
research methods, assemblage analysis, along with archaeological method and theory. The
papers in this session draw on these themes through a diversity of research projects and
assemblages extending from Eastern North America to India.

[83] SYMPOSIUM ■ The Great Maya Droughts In Cultural Context
A number of researchers have been building a case for the primary role of multi-decadal droughts
in four separate episodes of ancient Maya “collapse” spanning the Preclassic to Post-Classic
periods. Although the mounting data does suggest that severe droughts did occur at various
intervals during this time span, problems remain with respect to the precise dating of these
droughts, their actual intensity, and in terms of how they articulate with the actual culture histories
of the various centers in question. The papers in this symposium critically assess the drought
model using a range of archaeological and environmental data.
[84] SYMPOSIUM ■ Crossing Boundaries: Rock Art and Cultural Identity, Part A
(SPONSORED BY ROCK ART INTEREST GROUP)
As a highly distinctive and immobile cultural expression, rock art is uniquely suited to studies of
past cultural identity. Rock art both defines boundaries and transcends those inferred from other
kinds of cultural phenomena. In the American Southeast, and throughout the world, rock art
scholars are crossing geographic, cultural, and theory boundaries to explain the complexities of
cultural identity.
[85] SYMPOSIUM ■ ENVISIONING THE SHORE: NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE OCCUPATION AND ANTHROPIC
CONFIGURATION OF COASTAL SETTINGS
(SPONSORED BY JOURNAL OF ISLAND AND COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGY)
Our session aims to explore new theoretical focuses and developments into the archaeology of
coastal settings. In this session, we are keen to discuss the variety of coastal occupations that
characterized shorelines around the world, with special emphasis in mound construction, midden
deposition, and landscape configuration. We are particularly interested in new methods and
techniques applied to the study of coastal sites in dynamic environments. We welcome all
archaeologists working with innovative and interdisciplinary topics, as well as methodological and
theoretical advances for the study of costal societies.
[86] SYMPOSIUM ■ STUDIES OF THE PRODUCTION OF SPACE IN ANCIENT CITIES
Recent studies challenge long-held assumptions about the kinds of spaces and social
relationships that constitute ancient cities, and classic means of analyzing urban space. The
study of urban space is complicated by variability within and between cities, as well as their
relative enormity. This session presents studies that analyze the production of urban space in a
variety of ancient cities across the globe. Our goal is to advance our understanding of urban
space, and ways of studying this space, with a view towards improving our ability to compare
urbanism across time and place.
[87] SYMPOSIUM ■ A BIG VIEW OF IDENTITY AND INTERACTION: MACRO-REGIONAL CULTURAL
VARIATION IN THE U.S. SOUTHWEST
This session compares broad scale spatial and temporal variation for diverse media in the
prehispanic U.S. American Southwest. The papers consider the question of how far an ancient
Southwesterner would have to travel before he or she encountered people who were noticeably
different in their physical appearance, speech, clothing and jewelry, foods, ceramics, residential
and public architecture, rock art, and burial practices. The patterns for these different
characteristics are compared at the macro scale and their implications for the issues of identity
and interaction in the prehispanic Southwest through time are considered.
[88] POSTER SESSION ■ GENERAL NEW WORLD AND METHODS POSTER SESSION
[89] POSTER SESSION ■ THE GAULT SCHOOL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH: PERSPECTIVES ON THE
EARLIEST PEOPLES IN THE NEW WORLD
Paleoindian research, particularly that looking at the earliest peoples in the New World, is in the
midst of a tremendous paradigm shift. New data has made it essential to reevaluate old ideas and
examine new methodology and technologies. The Gault School of Archaeological Research was
formed with this in mind. This poster session looks at the GSAR and ongoing work at the Gault
Clovis site, the continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico and Central America.
[90] POSTER SESSION ■ ARCHEOLOGY AND EVERGLADES RESTORATION
The Everglades Restoration is one of the largest ecosystem restoration projects ever undertaken.
This restoration project extends from the Lake Okeechobee basin south to the Florida Keys
covering most of South Florida. Cultural resource support for this project in compliance with State
and Federal historic preservation laws is providing archeologist with an opportunity to work in
, 12                                       ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING
areas long neglected. The posters in this session examine some of the cultural resource issues
identified for the area and look at the results of the first surveys and site testing projects.
[91] SYMPOSIUM ■ TOWARDS AN INTERNATIONAL INVENTORY OF PREHISTORIC MINES AND QUARRIES
(SPONSORED BY PREHISTORIC QUARRIES AND EARLY MINES INTEREST GROUP)
Despite the widespread presence of prehistoric extraction sites in the historic environment, many
are overlooked or their importance unrecognised, thus placing them at risk. Although amongst the
earliest examples of technology, they rarely receive World Heritage Site status, and some have
no legal protection at all. Currently, catalogues are restricted to certain countries or particular
stone types, but this is not universal. This initial symposium will work towards achieving a
directory for those working in the field: contributions will provide an overview by country, region,
or stone type, to begin to build an international inventory.
[92] SYMPOSIUM ■ MESOAMERICA'S FORMATIVE: NEW APPROACHES IN AND OUT OF OLMAN
Today’s scholars of Formative Mesoamerica have not grown impervious to the debates of
yesterday, such as issues of cultural origin, influences, and social organization, but have tried to
build upon the foundation laid by present and past generations. Creating an awareness of
theoretical biases and addressing new frameworks of inquiry, this panel will present the latest
trends in the study of Formative Development. Offering varied approaches to a range of topics,
papers will include reports on socio-political and economic structures, cross-cultural interactions,
and material remains ranging from ceramics to architecture; in and out of the Gulf Coast. The
ultimate goal of this panel is to move forward the discussions of Formative development through
the evaluation of new discoveries and the reevaluation of pre-existing data.
[93] SYMPOSIUM ■ WHAT IS NEW IN MESOAMERICAN CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY: THE IMPLICATIONS OF NEW
FIELD DISCOVERIES FOR METHOD AND THEORY, PART I
Driven by a number of large cave focused projects, the pace of discovery in Mesoamerican cave
archaeology was extremely high during the previous year. This session seeks to present a forum
for the dissemination of this new information. Many discoveries are important because they signal
the need to reassess the way we look at our subject matter. In that vein, this session emphasizes
not simply the presentation of new data but focuses especially on the implications of these finds
for theory and methodology in the field.
[94] SYMPOSIUM ■ FOOTPRINTS ON THE LANDSCAPE: THE HISTORICAL ECOLOGY OF HUNTER-
GATHERERS
Historical ecology has recently taken center-stage in archaeological research. A key component
of this research framework is the idea that humans intentionally and unintentionally modify the
landscape to such an extent that these areas can be largely regarded as anthropogenic in
character. Often these modifications, or human legacies, have lasting effects on biogeographic
systems. Much of this research focuses on large-scale agricultural communities. In this
symposium, papers address the degree of landscape transformation by groups following mainly a
hunting and gathering and/or limited horticultural economy. Specifically, we confront the idea that
such economies have a light or limited impact on the landscape.

[97] SYMPOSIUM ■ INVESTIGATING RITUAL AND DOMESTIC SPACES AND PRACTICES AT AN EARLY
COLONIAL MISSION IN HIGHLAND PERU
This session explores the emergence of new ritual and domestic spaces and practices during the
initial evangelization of the Andes through analyses of new excavation data from the site of
Malata, an Inka provincial settlement and early mission in the Colca Valley of southern Peru.
These papers investigate the growth of Malata as a mission and changes in its spatial syntax,
including the remodeling of the chapel, Inka imperial structure, plaza, and pathways at the site.
Analyses of excavation findings from residential structures of varied form, size, and elaboration in
several distinct contexts illustrate differences in their organization and activities.

Soil Geochemical analyses are proving useful in determining ancient uses of household activity
areas, plaza functions, and agricultural and vegetative histories. Soil Scientists, archaeologists,

analyses soils from Mesoamerica.
[101] POSTER SESSION ■ RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN PRE-COLUMBIAN PACIFIC
NICARAGUA
This poster session presents the preliminary results of recent and ongoing archaeological
research projects in Pacific Nicaragua, led by Geoffrey McCafferty, with a focus on Sapoá period
(A.D. 800-1250) excavations at the sites of Santa Isabel (2000-2005) and Tepetate (2008) on the
Isthmus of Rivas. This is a time period for which ethnohistoric and linguistic evidence has
suggested strong interaction with the Mesoamerican world system. Archaeology provides an
opportunity to evaluate these hypotheses of long distance economic and cultural exchange.
[102] GENERAL SESSION ■ PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE MODELS AMONG THE MAYA
[103] SYMPOSIUM ■ MUST BE TRUE, I SAW IT IN A VIDEO!
(SPONSORED BY MEDIA RELATIONS COMMITTEE)
Video presentations on television and on the Web are popular and often the only sources of
information about archaeology and past cultures which attract the public. The stories they tell are
accepted as professionally validated solely because they appear on television or on the Web.
They are generally accepted without critical evaluation by members of the public or the general
archaeological community. This symposium critically examines popular video programs and
series found on television and on the Web in order to discover and evaluate the covert and overt
messages about archaeology and past cultures found in these presentations.
[104] SYMPOSIUM ■ TEACHING ETHICS IN ARCHAEOLOGY
The importance of addressing ethical issues in archaeology is not confined to graduate programs;
rather it is intrinsic to many actions and decisions that archaeologists face. Because ethical
issues range from professional conduct to how one perceives the protection and conservation of
the past, this forum will highlight some of the key areas where the teaching of archaeological
ethics should be an imperative such as in museums, or CRM firms, in public outreach projects or
academic settings. The RPA will present an award to participating Ethics Bowl teams and general
discussion with all members of the profession will be encouraged.
[105] FORUM ■ WHO'S RIGHT IS MORE RIGHT? CONSULTATION AND RESOURCE PROTECTION IN LAND
MANAGEMENT DECISIONS
(SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICA RELATIONS)
Land touches many by providing a place to walk, a plant gathering area, a place to live, fresh
water and food. The protection of these uses and natural resources while developing the land is a
complex juggling act. What is the archaeologist's role within this process? How do
landowners/managers weigh the needs of all stakeholders during their management activities?
Are archaeological findings unbiased scientific facts or can they be misused? We will explore how
multiple histories and stakeholders affect the CEQA or Section 106 process, how varied
consultation can be, and how important PR is in handling these complex issues.
[106] SYMPOSIUM ■ A LIFE IN THE PITT, THE CAREER AND INFLUENCE OF JAMES B. RICHARDSON, III AS
SEEN FROM HIS DISCIPLES
We wish to honor in this session the influence and contributions of James B. Richardson III,
professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a long time researcher of the Department of
Anthropology at the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. His achievements from pioneering
research on the Peruvian North Coast, New England, and Pennsylvania to his advances in the
disciplines of maritime and environmental archaeology will be described. His far reaching and
global influence in the field will be demonstrated through the presentation of research by his
students and colleagues who have benefited from his instruction, mentoring and friendship.
[107] SYMPOSIUM ■ IDENTITY AND HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN AFRICA: ESSENTIAL METHODOLOGIES
COMBINING ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY, ORAL TRADITION, AND ORAL HISTORY
Identity and History in Africa will focus on methodological innovations in African historical
archaeology. History is about securing and transforming identity and many societies only
recognize oral tradition as a legitimate way of knowing the past. Yet, the politics of nationalism
and ethnocentrism continue to create fissures and dichotomies that separate people from their
own past and permeate the methods associated with traditional archaeology. The papers in this
, 14                                       ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING
session emphasize the importance of incorporating descendant populations in the interpretation
of the their past through a dialogue between ethnoarchaeology, oral tradition/history, and
archaeology.
[108] SYMPOSIUM ■ BEYOND EMPIRE: THE LOCAL AND THE MARGINAL IN ARCHAIC STATES
The relationships among ancient state (or imperial) centers and sites on their margins have often
been viewed by archaeologists through the lens of World Systems models and, in particular,
core/periphery relations. This focus has tended to highlight the role of the dominant centers and
de-emphasize investigations into the development of local power relations within and beyond
states’ boundaries. In this session we will discuss archaeological data sets, economic and
sociopolitical models, and other alternative approaches to the study of the local, the marginal, and
the peripheral, and their relationships with associated states and empires.
[109] SYMPOSIUM ■ CROSSING BOUNDARIES: ROCK ART AND CULTURAL IDENTITY, PART B
(SPONSORED BY ROCK ART INTEREST GROUP)
As a highly distinctive and immobile cultural expression, rock art is uniquely suited to studies of
past cultural identity. Rock art both defines boundaries and transcends those inferred from other
kinds of cultural phenomena. In the American Southeast, and throughout the world, rock art
scholars are crossing geographic, cultural, and theory boundaries to explain the complexities of
cultural identity.
[110] SYMPOSIUM ■ Beyond Provenance: Ceramic Petrography and Ceramic Technology
(SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCES)
Ceramic petrographic analysis is primarily associated with provenance studies. A less
documented but potentially valuable avenue is what petrography reveals about technology.
Insight into the relationship of fabrics to function informs on relationships of technology, function,
tradition and intentionality of potters. Identifications of inclusions informs on tempering strategies
and the relationship of potters to their environment. Experimental work and evidence of forming
methods are rarely highlighted in publications focused on provenance. This symposium brings
together scholars for the opportunity to focus on findings in ceramic technology as identifiable
through ceramic petrography. These data are the undocumented promise of ceramic
petrography.
[111] SYMPOSIUM ■ CULTURAL EXPRESSION AND STYLE IN THE HUASTECA
The ancient Huastec legacy includes an ample body of artifacts and features that reflect local
developments alongside the interpretation and adaptation of diverse external influences through
time. To better comprehend the complex archaeological cultures of the Huasteca, we must clarify
our definitions of “Huastec style(s)” by first situating visual and expressive phenomena in time
and space in order to subsequently explore regional and cross cultural contact. We focus on style
as the result of historical processes, and thence define how use contexts and understandings of
stylistic uniformity and diversity inform our interpretations of the archaeological record in this
culture area.
[112] SYMPOSIUM ■ ACTORS' AND ARTIFACTS' AGENCIES: THE DYNAMICS OF CREATING LIVING
OBJECTS
(SPONSORED BY ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIVISION OF THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ASSOCIATION)
Recent materiality studies have reconceptualized artifacts as possessing life-essences that
influence humans. Precedents in anthropological aesthetics (Robert Armstrong) and the history of
art (Henri Focillon) discuss the formal qualities of creations and their basis in dynamic processes
of creativity, use, and change as factors that assign artifacts an order of existence. Processes
concerning the transformation, translation, or transition between the material and vital-spiritual
aspects of artifacts need to be further addressed. A key issue is the dynamic role of artifacts is
the transactional or reciprocal nature of the interchange between the object and its maker or user.
[113] SYMPOSIUM ■ TERRITORIALITY IN ARCHAEOLOGY: THE POLITICS OF LAND AND SPACE
Archaeologists have tended to assume that social power, particularly within complex polities, has
an explicitly territorial dimension - that sovereignty inherently entails the control of land. We often
depict political groups from mobile tribes to landed empires as two-dimensional "blobs" on maps.
However, recent work in geography and ethnohistory provides numerous examples of polities in
which authority is claimed and exerted through alternate modes - e.g., populations, symbolic
regimes. We ask why and under what circumstances - economic, environmental, cultural -
political domination and resistance are carried out in territorial terms and explore methodologies
through which territoriality can be investigated in the archaeological record.

[114] SYMPOSIUM ■ COMMUNITIES ACROSS SPACE & THROUGH TIME: INVESTIGATIONS IN SOUTHEAST
MESOAMERICA
Community studies bridge the gap between household and region, focusing attention on
questions of identity, intra-settlement variations in living arrangements, functions, social
formations, and changes through time in these factors. Processes operating at this intermediate
level yield insights into shifting cooperative and competitive relations among factions that
reflexively shape overarching political structures and domestic arrangements alike. Papers in this
session highlight differences and similarities in community form, uses of social memory, factional
competitions, and temporal changes in these variables across much of Southeast Mesoamerica.
Attention centers on the ways in which broad political processes were refracted through local
historical experiences.
[115] SYMPOSIUM ■ WHAT IS NEW IN MESOAMERICAN CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY: THE IMPLICATIONS OF

for the dissemination of this new information. Many discoveries are important because they signal
the need to reassess the way we look at our subject matter. In that vein, this session emphasizes
not simply the presentation of new data but focuses especially on the implications of these finds
for theory and methodology in the field.
[116] SYMPOSIUM ■ NAVIGATING TRANSFORMATIONS: SOCIAL COMPLEXITY IN THE NATIVE NORTHEAST
Northeast archaeologists have long debated the nature of social complexity among Native
peoples before and after European colonization. Most archaeologists assume that Native peoples
were egalitarian, at least before the advent of farming. But is the burial ceremonialism beginning
in the Archaic Period typical of egalitarian peoples? Did the adoption of maize agriculture have
implications for social differentiation? Did social networks change, continue, and/or strengthen in
the face of European colonization? Papers will address these and other issues related to social
complexity in the Northeast.
[117] SYMPOSIUM ■ ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN HONDURAS: UNDERSTANDING ANCIENT
LIFEWAYS IN THE INTERMEDIATE AREA
Synthesis of information collected from archaeological sites located in Honduras and portions of
the Maya Lowlands is essential to understanding the relationships ancient societies, situated on
the eastern periphery of Mesoamerica, established with their contemporaries to the south and
west. In this symposium, papers concerning current and past research at sites located in the
Intermediate Area are presented in the interest of developing an up to date perspective on
internal dynamics and interactions as well as external relationships with political and economic
entities located outside the region.

(SPONSORED BY PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND THE PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP)
The National Survey on Recreation and the Environment (NSRE) has been collecting data on
American’s involvement in outdoor activities—including visiting archaeological sites—for over 50
years. The survey data provides detailed recreation participation, demographic and lifestyle
information on archaeology’s active and diverse audiences—or “market segments”—that we can
use to target select segments of the population in order to help achieve our programmatic goals.
The forum panel will discuss how archaeologists and others involved in heritage management,
tourism, and cultural resources protection can apply this data to make their public outreach efforts
more focused, efficient, and effective.

DAILY LIFE: HOUSEHOLD ARCHAEOLOGY AT CERRO LEON IN THE MOCHE VALLEY, PERU
From AD 1-200 Cerro Leon and a cluster of nearby residential sites were occupied by immigrants
from the adjacent highlands just prior to the formation of the Southern Moche state. Cerro Leon, a
massive hilltop town, was the paramount center of an intrusive highland polity in the coca-growing
, 16                                     ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING

speaking people of the highlands mentioned in historic documents. We present the results five
field seasons of household excavations, surface collection, and mapping at Cerro León
conducted by the MOCHE-UNC Field School in South American Archaeology.
[122] POSTER SESSION ■ BETWEEN THE ICE AND THE SEA: REGIONAL INVESTIGATIONS IN
BORGARFJORDUR, ICELAND
In 2008, Brown University initiated a program of regional research in western Iceland that will
examine long-term trends in political economy, trajectories of resource use and management,
regional integration, and community development from the Viking Age to the recent past. The
posters in this symposium examine preliminary archaeological and geophysical results from NSF-
sponsored research at three sites - Hals - a small medieval farm, Skogarnes - a massive fuel-
extraction site from the Little Ice Age, and Gilsbakki - an interior elite farmstead with deep
stratigraphic deposits ranging in age from the medieval period through the 19th century.
[123] POSTER SESSION ■ NEW DISCUSSIONS ON GREAT MORAVIA
Recent discoveries at the Great Moravian center of Břeclav-Pohansko and theoretical advances
related to the Great Moravian sociopolitical manifestation (ca. 800 to 900 A.D.) are discussed and
evaluated. Ongoing collaborative research by Masaryk University-Brno and the College of
DuPage yields both refinements and challenges to conventional interpretations of Great Moravian
political manifestations and social organization. It is argued that Heterarchy and kin-based,
chiefdom structures played a significant role in the formation of the central Great Moravian polity
as well as the day-to-day lives of most Great Moravian people.
[124] POSTER SESSION ■ THE BOVA MARINA ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: NEW PERSPECTIVES AND
RECENT RESULTS
For the past twelve years a host of international scholars have been conducting fieldwork in
Calabria, southern Italy with the Bova Marina Archaeological Project. The contributions of this
work include numerous perspectives on the study of landscape (regional pedestrian survey,
terrestrial and marine geological survey, archival research of historic land use) and a diachronic
program of excavation that includes Neolithic, Bronze Age, Classical Greek, and Medieval
periods. Our session brings together this array of work as a means of illustrating the

[125] SYMPOSIUM ■ A PRE-CLOVIS CONTENDER IN NORTH FLORIDA: THE WAKULLA SPRINGS LODGE
SITE (8WA329)
A decade ago, investigations by the late Calvin Jones at the Wakulla Springs Lodge site identified
deeply buried Paleoindian components on a high bluff overlooking the springhead. A recent
National Geographic Society-funded project was carried out in an effort to further define and date
this early phase of human presence. The project recorded artifact-bearing pre-Clovis levels older
than had been hypothesized. Employing the Optically Stimulated Luminescence (OSL) method, it
also generated early corroborative dates. This session details the Wakulla project and its
resulting data and interpretations.

envision creating “co-futures” with others having vested interests in the past. Developing a vision
of co-futures may involve 180o turns from deeply ingrained principles and directions. Themes to
be explored include cultural continuity rather than change, survival, stability, and the positive
significance of “hybrid” outcomes.

[136] SYMPOSIUM · ECONOMY AND POLITY IN ANCIENT SOUTH ASIA: RESEARCH AND PERSPECTIVES
Relationships between economic and political organization(s) vary enormously across time and
space. As archaeologists seek to identify and understand patterning in this variation, the several
millennia of economic and political history encapsulated in the South Asian archaeological record
is of theoretical significance well beyond the subcontinent. With the goal of presenting their work
to a broad archaeological audience, participants in this symposium are asked to explore how the
manufacture, distribution, and consumption of material goods (subsistence, utilitarian, prestige,
etc.) condition and are in turn conditioned by the configuration and exercise of social power in
their field of inquiry.
[137] FORUM · IS ARCHAEOLOGY USEFUL?
Given various pressures, many archaeologists today are concerned to make their practice
"useful". The discipline frequently attempts to justify the investment of resources (both public and
private) on the grounds that they can offer important insights into a number of arenas deemed
significant - sustainable development, inter-ethnic relations, minority rights, etc. However, others
take the view that the presumed social value of such actions in the contemporary world can be
more efficiently and effectively accomplished by other fields. A defense of archaeology's
usefulness often turns to its special contribution either as critique, practical action, knowledge
production or some combination of all three. However, dissenting voices argue that "utility" is a
poor measure of valuation. Additionally, an increasing number of outsider voices challenge the
authority of archaeology altogether in favor of alternative interpretations of the past. In what ways
does this threaten archaeology's claim to value participation in and support for free intellectual
enquiry as a societal good in itself? Along these lines the forum seeks to address a number of
interrelated questions: 1. How important is the criterion of "usefulness" in establishing the value of
our discipline? To whom do we need to justify ourselves? 2. In what ways can or should
archaeology be useful to society? Is there and ideal balance between critique and action, and
should we even distinguish between the two? 3. Does it really matter what we do? If it does, then
for whom? 4. What are the dangers, the intended and unintended consequences of archaeology?
This forum, sponsored by the journal Archaeological Dialogues (CUP), will take the form of a
keynote address that was pre-circulated to a panel of 5-6 commentators. The address and
comments will then be followed by an open discussion with those in attendance. Abstract of Dr.
Dawdy's Keynote follows: "Millennial Archaeology: Locating the Discipline in the Age of
Insecurity" We have arrived at our own fin de siècle moment, a computer-driven version of that
European intellectual movement dating between 1880 and 1914 characterized by a mixture of
decadence and dread on the cusp of major change. Appropriate to the scale of a millennium
rather than a century, the global mood today seems exponentially deeper than it did a century
ago, with millennial preoccupations stemming from 9/11, global warming, disasters, new wars of
religion, food shortages, and growing neoliberal inequalities. Archaeology can’t help but be
affected by world events and cultural shifts. Asking the question “Is Archaeology Useful?” reflects
an anxiety about whether it is decadent to entertain studies of the obscure past when the future
feels so fragile. It also reflects an anxiety that a discipline rooted in colonial and nationalist
practices may have no place in a post-colonial, globalized world. Since the turn of the last
century, archaeology has made several attempts to “be useful” to contemporary society -- from V.
Gordon Childe’s marxism to the disastrous nationalism of Kossinna. More recent examples
include revisionist archaeologies of the African diaspora and the explosion in "public
archaeology," which covers everything from eco-tourism to contract archaeology and public
education. Are these efforts truly new in spirit, or useful in effect? Can archaeology be safely and
effectively applied to reinventing the future?

PREHISTORIC (5000-1000 BC) PORTUGAL: INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO SETTLEMENT AND
BURIAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE SIZANDRO-ALCABRICHEL RIVER VALLEYS, PORTUGAL
This session focuses on the current state of late prehistoric (5000-1000 BC) archaeological
research in the Sizandro-Alcabrichel river valleys in the Estremadura region of Portugal, and
emphasizes the value that interdisciplinary approaches can have in providing a more holistic
understanding of lifeways and deathways and environmental fluctuations throughout this dynamic
and formative period of Iberian history (the Neolithic through the Bronze Age). Although this
region has been the subject of long and intensive archaeological research for much of the 20th
century, few synthetic examinations of the interplay of cultural, biological, and environmental
dynamics exist.

[140] SYMPOSIUM ■ PLANTATIONS, FARMS, AND FRONTIERS: HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL
APPROACHES
Frontiers are metaphorical edges linking present to future or separating known from unknown.
Anthropologists and historians conceptualize frontiers as permeable boundaries at peripheries of
capitalist systems where, often violently but always creatively, interactions of cultural “others”
result in new cultural expressions. While New World authorities encouraged the growth of stable
plantations and farms to replace fluid frontier situations, within these settings change was
ongoing. The authors in this session discuss methodological and theoretical approaches for
considering the dynamic processes at work in frontier agricultural outposts and established
plantations where residents interacted on the boundaries of socio-cultural, technological, and
environmental transformation.
[141] SYMPOSIUM ■ ICONOCLASH AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF VIOLENCE TOWARD IMAGES
(SPONSORED BY COLUMBIA CENTER FOR ARCHAEOLOGY (COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK))
This session builds on the work of Bruno Latour and colleagues to expand our theoretical
understanding of iconoclasm and representational ambivalence beyond its traditionally unique
association with the religions of the Book. Our claim is that the tension between iconophobia and
iconophilia, between the destruction and the creation of images is a universal aspect of the
human experience. Hence, the study of why past peoples periodically rejected or did violence
unto images (why they broke figurines, burned temples, defaced pictures and the like) is the
necessary compliment to the study of why they made these images in the first place.

[143] SYMPOSIUM ■ COMMUNITIES IN TIME
Communities (broadly defined) of people exist in a temporal context that includes dynamic
environmental and social conditions. The archaeological community has amassed enough good
dates and good data to explore the causes and consequences of change/stasis,
continuity/discontinuity, re-use/abandonment, growth/collapse, and so on within a single group of
people over time. Although much archaeological research necessarily focuses on a single
methodology or topic, many regions have undergone intensive study by a variety of specialists
over the years and a local synthesis of data is possible. This session samples the current state of
local syntheses of archaeological research around the world.

Several large research programs have recently examined the area between the La Plata and
Upper San Juan River drainages, in northwestern New Mexico and southwestern Colorado.
Farming societies occupied this region at a various times from Basketmaker II through the Post-
Pueblo period. Long considered a periphery to the Mesa Verde and Chaco regions, this area has
taken on new importance as researchers have recognized its potentially pivotal role in the
histories of the other two. It is at the center of early Basketmaker and Puebloan developments, as
well as the emergence of post-Chacoan and Navajo cultures.

range of international archaeological projects formed a significant part of IPY activities,
addressing such issues as climate change impacts, human-animal relations, social interactions,
migrations, ethnic identities, and the relationship between history and modern peoples. This
archaeology IPY symposium will offer the opportunity to present the results culminating from two

other computer based applications. This session is intended to highlight recent methodological
applications and advances of landscape approaches within the Oceanic region. Poster
presentations offer a great opportunity to focus on compelling visual data generated through GIS
and spatial analysis which are often understated in oral presentation format.

present new data from geophysical survey, auger testing, and excavations in civic-ceremonial,
domestic, craft production, and mortuary contexts at Tres Zapotes as well as settlement survey
around El Meson, it’s political subordinate and successor. The data document the Early
Formative founding of Tres Zaptoes, its subsequent emergence as a regional Olmec capital, and
the development of a ruling confederation and a less exclusionary political economy in the face of
Late Formative period factional competition.

settlement, subsistence, technology, and ideology. This symposium presents an opportunity to
disseminate new primary data, in addition to revisiting older data sets from a more informed
perspective. Most importantly, it is intended to revitalize interest among those who have cultivated
an enduring fascination with the cultures of Late and Terminal Archaic Period peoples, and
perhaps even attract new researchers to this area of interest.

, 20                                        ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 74TH ANNUAL MEETING
these three centers were focal points of settlement and power similar to city-states observed in
other parts of the ancient world. At the same time, our data allow a critical examination of the
"ruralization" (sensu Yoffee 1995) associated with these politico-territorial units. In this region of
the Maya lowlands, a commingling of urban and rural features can be observed.

[159] FORUM ■ TEACHING LAW IN ARCHAEOLOGY: PERSPECTIVES FROM THE FIELD
(SPONSORED BY HERITAGE VALUES INTEREST GROUP)
As the law holds increasing significance for the discipline and practice of archaeology, the
teaching of law in the curriculum is expanding. This session reflects on the role of law within the
discourse of archaeology. How is it taught? Who teaches it? Where is it categorized within
institutional frameworks? What does the future hold? In addressing these questions, and others,
this session draws upon the experience and expertise of lawyers, law professors, and
archaeologists who teach law to archaeologists at both the undergraduate and graduate levels in
archaeology and anthropology departments and in law schools in the US and abroad.
[160] SYMPOSIUM ■ REDEFINING THE BOUNDS OF CONSULTATION: THE FORT A.P. HILL ALTERNATE
MITIGATION PROGRAM AS AN EXAMPLE OF A UNITED STATES ARMY REGIONAL CONSERVATION
APPROACH
In 1941, the creation of Camp A.P. Hill, in Caroline and Essex counties, Virginia, redrew political
borders, eliminating dozens of established communities. Today, urban sprawl and development
threaten significant, off-installation, resources in the vicinity of the military reservation. The Fort
A.P. Hill Alternate Mitigation Program is a regional approach to cultural resource management
which mitigates adverse effects to on-installation Civil War-era sites and nineteenth-century
farmsteads through consultation, cooperative research, and off-installation conservation
easements on seventeenth-century, American Indian resources. Through existing, and
developing, regional environmental partnerships, the Army hopes to ensure responsible
conservation on the installation and in the surrounding environs.
[161] SYMPOSIUM ■ EVOLUTIONARY DYNAMICS OF COOPERATION
Archaeologists have almost completely ignored bottom-up possibilities for achieving group
cooperation and cohesion in favor of political models emphasizing how top-down leadership
might appear and thrive. Yet the evidence is increasingly strong that humans have evolved
capacities for cooperative behaviors employing a number of mechanisms applicable at
increasingly broad social and spatial scales (e.g., kin favoritism, direct and indirect reciprocity,
social norms, and ethnic marking). In this symposium we examine how these mechanisms might
be brought to bear to explain archaeological phenomena, either singly, in combination, or in the
context of top-down leadership.
[162] SYMPOSIUM ■ END OF THE GOLDEN AGE? FIELD SCHOOLS AND THE FUTURE OF
ARCHAEOLOGY
Recently, Brian Fagan suggested that archaeology is failing at creating the next generation of
public support for the discipline. As archaeology is becoming ever more specialized and complex,
interest of lay audiences is rapidly declining. Is archaeology losing its appeal? The emergent
popularity of field schools may assist in stopping, possibly reversing, this trend. This session will
explore the advantages, hazards and benefits quality field schools may have for archaeology.
Using the recently established UCLA Field Program, speakers will explore its vision, impact and
success at both exposing archaeology to a wider audience and providing significant and stable
financial support for quality field research.

Research on large coastal shell mounds has experienced a revival in the last decade due to
renewed interest in coastal adaptations and related studies on economic intensification and
complex hunter-gatherers. Regional and diverse research programs from around the world will be
reviewed and compared with the aim at exploring the possibility of common variables playing an
important role in the formation of these large coastal sites. Topics such as chronologies and
timing within local cultural sequences, geographic distribution, possible paleoenvironmental
factors in their formation, subsistence strategies and demography, site function and spatial
arrangement of sites, will be discussed among others.
[166] SYMPOSIUM ■ Breaking and Entering the Aztec World: Papers in Honor of Liz Brumfiel
Elizabeth Brumfiel has been at the forefront in applying social theory to Aztec archaeology and
history, beginning with her research at Huexotla in the 1970's in which she challenged models of
Aztec city-state development, and with posterior research in Xico and Xaltocan. She has also
been a pioneer in the archaeology of gender, archaeological studies of Aztec ideology, craft
production, and factionalism, among others. This symposium brings together leading specialists
and promising new scholars to explore current directions in Aztec studies and assess Brumfiel's
influence and contributions to Aztec archaeology and beyond.
[167] SYMPOSIUM ■ LANDSCAPE NEOLITHIZATION ALONG EAST ASIAN INLAND SEAS
Archaeologists in East Asia have identified distinctive trajectories of long-term culture change.
The region enjoys a rich material record, including the world's oldest pottery (ca.16,000
CALYBP), evidence of unique hunter-gatherer adaptations, early plant cultivation and
corresponding agricultural dispersals. These innovations played a key role in generating new
forms of cultural landscapes. In this symposium, regional specialists examine how these natural
and cultural landscapes were transformed physically and ideologically as fisher-hunter-gatherers
developed new social systems during the "Neolithization" of littoral East Asia. The papers will
explore the active role of ideology and human agency in the transformations of these cultural
landscapes.
[168] SYMPOSIUM ■ PROVENANCE STUDIES IN ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCES AND THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION
FOR OBSIDIAN STUDIES)
Archaeologists have used a number of geochemical techniques to obtain provenance information
to develop and refine models for, human migration, local exchange networks, and large-scale
trade structures. Techniques have been developed to analyze a variety of archaeological material
such as obsidian, turquoise, quartz, and ceramics as well as studies in human migration. New
instrumentation is less destructive, more precise and requires less material for analysis.
Therefore, isotopic analysis and other geochemical techniques are increasingly being utilized to
source archaeological materials. This session will bring together researcher who have applied or
developed provenance techniques.

papers that tap the diverse empirical, interpretive, and theoretical contributions that Sharer has
made to address topics and debates on current issues and enduring questions. The papers
address themes drawn from Maya archaeology and related studies of Maya society past and

given scant archaeological attention. The subsequent thirty years of nearly continuous
investigation into the Sicán and broader Lambayeque prehistory by the Sicán Archaeological
Project have helped transform the above perception. This symposium synthesizes the Project’s

[171] SYMPOSIUM ■ NATIVE AND IMPERIAL MORPHOGENESIS: COMPARING 16TH CENTURY ENTRADAS
IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST
The earliest Spanish expeditions into the American Southwest and Southeast set in motion
cultural transformations with profound and lasting implications – both for Native communities in
the western hemisphere and for European imperial powers in the east. As a wealth of
documentary, ethnohistorical, archaeological and other information has accumulated in recent
years, new opportunities have emerged to compare systematically the impacts of these important
events in two major regions of the Spanish Empire. By tracing similar themes in both geographic
areas, this session seeks to illuminate patterns of cultural interaction, transformation and
continuity during the initial period of Native-European contact.
[172] SYMPOSIUM ■ RECENT RESEARCH IN SOUTH-CENTRAL PUERTO RICO
Recently, several teams have undertaken interesting archaeological research in the Portugues
River valley in south-central Puerto Rico, to complement past and on-going research at the Tibes.
Survey/testing, innovative zooarchaeological sampling, social memory research, and data
recovery excavations have been undertaken in the past two years. Extensive excavations at PO-
29 resulted in important and spectacular discoveries, yet that study is only one part of a regional
approach to better understanding the past of the Portugues River valley. The PO-29 project also
brought into focus several major issues in Puerto Rican archaeology, and this symposium
includes a critique of the project.
[173] SYMPOSIUM ■ INDIGENOUS MATERIALITIES AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS IN THE EASTERN
WOODLANDS
In the Eastern Woodlands and elsewhere, archaeological theory and practice have become more
respectful of Indigenous voices, a development less visible in archaeological analysis. This
session asks two questions: 1) How do archaeologists determine the logics under which
archaeological data were generated? 2) How does praxis (need to) change when archaeologists
take such logics to heart? Participants address these questions in terms of the standard axes of
archaeological analysis (architectural, ceramic, flora, etc) in the Native History of the Eastern
Woodlands. The answers should be interesting for other regions, where archaeologists and their
data may have different materialities and expressions.

AND INTERPRETATION
(SPONSORED BY GEOARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP)
This poster session provides a forum to explore the explanative power of geoarchaeological
approaches to archaeological interpretation. Geoarchaeologists provide alternative models for
understanding the subtleties of the archaeological record and the processes that formed it. Our
research often challenges field assumptions, provides spatial and temporal context to artifact
specialists and addresses long-standing questions about site formation. These posters
demonstrate significant contributions earth science specialists make to understanding the past
through field, lab and analytical methods. The session aims to reach a wide archaeological
audience by presenting both methodological as well as theoretical advancements provided by a
geoarchaeological framework.
[176] POSTER SESSION ■ SCIENCE IN SUPPORT OF ARCHAEOLOGY
Advances in technology continue to expand our ability to interpret the past. Environmental and
other sciences are essential to understanding the archaeological record. For instance, AMS
radiocarbon dating now has a boost through identification of the charcoal being dated. Global
warming has brought to the fore our "need to know" about the past environment and what
changes influenced people's settlement patterns. Pollen and phytolith analyses are two that
contribute heavily to this area. Identifying foods relies upon a collection of sciences such as
pollen, starch, phytolith, macrofloral, and protein and organic residue analysis.

through the lived experience of the individual body, through representations of the body, and
through regulation of the body. Archaeological approaches toward these forms of embodiment
can highlight the historical processes that serve to institutionalize and even valorize physical
expressions of oppression, injury, and battle. Papers in the session will be asked to explicitly
relate theories of embodiment with both literal and implied signatures of structural violence and
conflict.

In October 2006, the National Park Service Office of International Affairs began accepting
applications for the new U.S. World Heritage Tentative List, a list of American cultural, natural and
mixed properties that are potential future candidates for the World Heritage List. Of the 14
properties on the new Tentative List, three are archaeological and a fourth has archaeological
components. This forum brings together people preparing World Heritage nominations on behalf
of candidate properties, people with insight into the nomination process and the characteristics of
a successful nomination, and people who manage sites already inscribed on the World Heritage
List.
[187] SYMPOSIUM ■ EARLY WRITING AND AGENCY: EPIGRAPHY AND AGENTS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RECORD
In recent years, archaeologists have incorporated the concept of "agency" in various guises. This
situation may indicate some confusion as to what agency "is," or should be. The aim of this
symposium is to illustrate how a text-based perspective can clarify some of the problems and
possibilities of using agency in archaeology. Papers will approach early writing systems through
the theoretical lens of agency, allowing for the identification and discussion of observable actors
in the archaeological record. This approach will help distinguish between intentions,
consequences, meanings, and motivations, thus increasing understanding of historically
particular subjectivities of past social actors.
[188] SYMPOSIUM ■ THE REAL WORLD: TEACHING ARCHAEOLOGY IN NON-TRADITIONAL WAYS AND
PLACES
Archaeologists increasingly find themselves working in non-traditional settings with a range of
audiences. Teaching and learning today extend well beyond the four walls of the classroom. As
such, there is a need to create and develop new and different approaches to teaching and
understanding the past. One of the major challenges in presenting archaeology in an attractive
and understandable manner to a lay population is maintaining the integrity of the subject matter.
This session will present a discussion of some of the problems and the solutions involved in
moving an understanding of the past out and beyond a traditional classroom.

to enhance or hinder our interpretation of culture-historical processes.
[192] SYMPOSIUM ■ RECENT ADVANCES IN PRECLASSIC LOWLAND MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY
Recent research has shown the Preclassic Maya to have a rich and varied culture found
throughout the Northern and Southern Lowlands. Stunning examples of Preclassic artistic
traditions have been found in the Southern Lowlands along with impressive monumental
architecture. In Belize, the Maya occupation has been found to be older and more diverse than
expected, and in the northern lowlands, where the map was once nearly blank, Preclassic Maya
sites now abound. This complex and burgeoning occupation warrants a reconsideration of the
Preclassic Maya and their role in larger Preclassic Mesoamerica.

numerous cultural groups into its state. Control over these populations was facilitated by
constructing new provincial sites and co-opting existing ones, creating mixed Inca-local
settlements. These sites demonstrate great variation in architectural style, planning, and layout,
often in correlation with the settlements’ relationship with the empire. This paper examines
settlements of the Lucanas, Andamarca Lucanas, and other provincial groups in the southern
highlands of Ayacucho to assess the architectural diversity of Inca-local settlements and how it
relates to this region’s place within the imperial sociopolitical hierarchy.

[21] Interaction and Domains in South Asia and the Old World: Papers in Honor of Gregory L.
Possehl
This paper will introduce and contextualize the work of Gregory L. Possehl in the areas of
interaction and domains. His original research, compilation and synthesis of separate site reports
and notations lead to broader understanding of the Indus Civilization and interaction across
South, Central, and West Asia. Possehl's concept of domains explains both variation and
coherence in material culture across the Indus. His model of third millennium Middle Asian
Interaction Sphere (MAIS) is supported by evidence at multiple sites. This paper provides an
overview of contemporary research influenced by Possehl's work ranging from ceramic
comparisons to pastoralism to paleoanthropology.

[152] The Homestead Model of Early/Middle Woodland Settlement: A Landscape Approach from
SE Ohio
There are various models of community sedentism for Woodland societies of southern Ohio.
These models range from considerable seasonal and annual community movement to those of
domestic permanence. Here we offer the “homestead model” of settlement guided by the
principle that communities were flexible and opportunistic in their movements but reoccupied an
increasingly restricted domestic space. By the Woodland period, each community’s residences
were limited to a specific set of landforms that defined that community’s homestead. Data to
support this model are drawn from domestic sites and GIS analyses in the Hocking Valley,
southeastern Ohio.

[83] Introduction: The Dynamics of Ancient Maya Developmental History
After over a century of archaeological research a coherent overview of Maya culture history is still
elusive. In some areas and periods major chronological problems remain unresolved, and even in
cases where chronology is clearer, great variability is seen among sites. These issues are
relevant to recent discussions of at least four major collapse-like events in the Maya area and
their relationship to drought. Here we review the dynamics of ancient Maya developmental history
in relation to these hypotheses. We argue that multiple cycles of integration and disintegration in
the ancient Maya world problematize simplistic explanations of Maya “collapse.”

The first, Oroncota, nearby the Southeastern frontier, displayed the investment of fine

socioeconomy or the actual presence of colonies. In the second, Charazani, the empire did not
only establish colonies from nearby Inkanized provinces, but also promoted the influx of imperial
materials. Therefore, these two examples highlight the role of portable and non-portable media in
the materialization of power, and the effects of varying colonization strategies in the makeup of
empires.

[115] Mountain Shrines Where Mortals and Gods Converse: Q'anil, the Maya Jakaltec Sacred
Mountain in Huehuetenango, Guatemala
Maya religious symbolism has an earthly focus with most being manifestations of mountains and
caves. Mountains are sacred places referred to by the specific names of guardians or owners
who also represent deities or ancestral figures. Since mountains are features of worship, for
modern Maya Jakaltek the connections of people and community to earth are expressed at
shrines at the summit of Q’anil where they ask deities for protection, the life-giving rains, and
intercession on mundane affairs. The belief system, reproduced through ritual acts, anchors the
ever-changing present into the precedents of the pre-Columbian past.

An introduction to the symposium’s presentations, this paper reviews some of the approaches
adopted by archaeologists in their study of the life histories of objects. Topics addressed by the
paper include the different dimensions along which artifact meaning and function can vary (e.g.
time; space; social group), as well as the mechanisms that underlie such modifications (e.g. faulty
memory; the removal of artifacts from circulation through burial; the intentional reinterpretation of
function). Examples from East Asia and other parts of the world are used to illustrate the potential
that these varied approaches hold for such artifact focused studies.

[26] The Use of Confidence Intervals for Calibrated Radiocarbon Dates
Current methods of calibrating individual radiocarbon age determinations involve the computation
of what are, in effect, Bayesian posterior probability distributions (although the Bayesian nature of
the process is not always acknowledged and rarely fully exploited). These posterior probability
distributions are usually asymmetric with multiple peaks. Confidence intervals, or “calibrated
ranges”, constructed from these complex distributions often are discontinuous, with multiple
segments to which various probabilities are attached. This approach needlessly complicates
reporting and interpretation. In this paper I discuss alternative methods for constructing
confidence intervals for calibrated radiocarbon dates that result in slightly longer, but continuous,
calibrated ranges.

materials and foreign trade materials. The study provides information on the internal and external
trade relations of Ptolemaic Egypt.

[19] Shell tool production and the Terminal Classic political economy of Xuenkal
One expected consequence of the political control Chichén Itzá had over its closest neighbors is
regional diversification of economic activities. Recent excavations in a Sotuta associated platform
at Xuenkal confirm that local corporate elite groups were involved in craft diversification, more
than specialization. Elite residential groups at Xuenkal were involved in a variety of shell
production activities as demonstrated by evidence from platform FN129, associated with other
craft debitage. We suggest domestic space was modified to accommodate economic activities
that were not practiced within domestic settings in earlier periods.

[50] The Chalcolithic of the Near East and Southeastern Europe in a New Perspective:
Discoveries in the Cave Areni-1, Armenia
In 2007-08 four meters thick deposits of the Neolithic and Chalcolithic were excavated in the cave
Areni-1 located in southeastern Armenia. Wonderfully preserved organic remains include wooden
artifacts, seeds, ropes, textiles, straw, grass, reeds, and dried fruits (grapes and prunes) dated
between 4223 and 3797 BC (14C calibrated). Other finds suggest the possibility of wine making
in the cave. A human brain was found inside a ritually deposited plastered head. Pottery
assemblages stipulate a revision of the macro-regional Chalcolithic-Early Bronze Age chronology
and support a partial synchronization of the Maikop Culture of Southeastern Europe with the Uruk
civilization in Mesopotamia.

[53] The Diffusion of Geographic Information Systems within Academic Archaeology
Despite the growing use of GIS in archaeological studies, there are very few, if any,
comprehensive reviews of the development of GIS in the discipline or its influence within the
broader realm of spatial archaeology. Much of the literature is limited to GIS applications in
archaeological research, which does not address the degree to which the technology has been
adopted and diffused within the discipline. This poster presents the results of a content analysis
of published studies of the last two decades that details the frequency, type, and level of
analytical complexity of GIS use in academic archaeology.

[134] A New Approach in Site Mapping: Grass GIS and Vector Re-positioning
The increasing availability of high-resolution remote sensing imagery has the potential to
revolutionize archaeological site mapping and recording. Without expensive equipment or
software, even small sites with visible architecture can be identified and mapped in georectified
imagery. Even recently destroyed or damaged sites can be mapped whether or not base maps
exist. I present examples of combining remote sensing data from Google Earth, CORONA,
Terra/ASTER, and SRTM to map early metal age sites in the Wadi el-Hasa, southern Jordan.
Such digital maps can be exported into GIS software allowing analysis of spatial patterning for
studying social and ecological dynamics.

[30] “Nondestructive” Radiocarbon Dating of Textiles and Perishable Artifacts: A Review of
Progress to Date
A ‘non-destructive’ method for radiocarbon dating perishable archaeological remains requires
replacing the two very destructive steps in current radiocarbon dating: (1) pretreatment to remove
contaminating humic acids; and (2) extraction of carbon for accelerator mass spectrometric
(AMS) analysis. We have successfully used low-temperature argon and oxygen plasmas to
extract sufficient carbon from the surface of an artifact without visibly changing it. To address the
problem of humic contamination, we have used a gentle pH 8 phosphate buffer. The phosphate
treatment combined with the plasma extraction yields AMS dates that are statistically
indistinguishable from those obtained through standard techniques

Interpretations of Iron Age violence are filtered through the value systems of literate Greece and

model examines the archaeological evidence for Iron Age European violence as embodied in the
physical remains of individuals and encoded in the material culture symbolism of warfare.

The Ocosta, Washington railroad boomtown site is illustrated in three narratives: the city-as-

research method: archival, archeological geophysical prospection, and oral history. Each source
of information highlights a different perspective of Ocosta. Weaving together archival,
archeological, and oral history information creates a stronger portrait of the past than is otherwise
possible. The Ocosta town site is examined as a case study intermingling research methods to
obtain a clearer picture of the past. Preliminary results of these interlocking strands of research
will be illustrated, bringing together the elaborate puzzle that is Ocosta-by-the-Sea.

[130] Exploring arsenic contamination in antiquity: the Chinchorro mummies case
This paper explores to what extent pre-Columbian populations from Northern Chile were affected
by exposure to arsenic. Using laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-
ICP-MS) we tested arsenic levels in a single strand of hair from 24 Arica mummies. Each hair
was cleaned using standard procedures and ablated using a 266 nm Nd-YAG UV laser. Hair
samples were also examined for diagenesis, though minimal diagenesis was found. Arsenic hair
levels in the mummies ranged from < 0.2 to > 20.5 µg/g. Our study shows that ancient people of
northern Chile were significantly affected by exposure to environmental arsenic.

[12] Residential Occupation in the Periphery of Tiwanaku: Preliminary Results of the 2007/2008
Mollo Kontu Field Seasons
Recent studies outside of the monumental core of Tiwanaku have found that the city contained
numerous residential compounds separated by large adobe walls. We present preliminary
information on excavations of a residential sector at Mollo Kontu. Here, we encountered at least
four recognizable occupations including associated domestic features, such as hearths and
middens. This residential sector experienced cycles of abandonment and reuse, maintaining its
orthogonal grid throughout all occupations, but changing other architectural details. Investigation
of this compound provides insight into urban structure, the significance of local variation, and the
patterns of daily life within the city of Tiwanaku.

Similar deposits at other western Belize Maya sites have been interpreted as evidence for de-

support for either argument and suggests that the deposits could also be associated with post-
abandonment rituals, site reoccupation, or both.

[81] Social Identity, Migration and Return in the Tiwanaku diaspora: A mortuary and
paleodemographic approach
The Tiwanaku colonization of the Moquegua valley has been described as the migration of tens
of thousands of highlanders and descendants, permanently resident in a lowland agropastoral
niche. However, recent mortuary archaeology suggests diverse mortuary practices in the
Tiwanaku diaspora, while a comparison of paleodemographic data from Moquegua Tiwanaku
cemeteries to uniformitarian mortality curves suggests an underrepresentation of older adults.
Socially embedded explanations of return migration, alternate burial treatment among pastoral
and agrarian populations, and mummy repatriation are considered in light of migration theory and
parallel settlement pattern and household archaeological studies of Tiwanaku society.

fill of architectural features, in the context of lithic workshop deposits, or within domestic middens.
Such waste also remained in or was reincorporated into a systemic context by changing

The static, fragmentary archaeological record requires us to construct models of the human past.
Traditionally, these have been narratives that make compelling stories but are difficult to evaluate.
Recent advances in geospatial and agent-based modeling technology offers the potential to
create quantitative models of human systems, but also challenge us to conceive of human
societies in ways that can be expressed in algorithmic form. Besides making our own
explanations more robust, integrating such quantitative modeling into archaeological practice can
produce more useful accounts of human systems and their long-term dynamics for other

[44] The Economics of Stasis: Pleistocene-Holocene Quartz Industries on China’s Western Loess
Plateau
Though successive hominid populations faced dramatic environmental changes and exploited
China’s western Loess Plateau very differently through time, their lithic industry was remarkably
resilient, consisting of a simple, struck-pebble quartz tool tradition that persisted for more than
80,000 years. This persistence reflects the economics of a mobility pattern dictated mainly by the
distribution of raw materials and other resources in a vertically stratified landscape. While lithic
technologies varied slightly over time and distinct lithic industries came and went on the periphery
of the Loess Plateau, costly toolstone acquisition and tool manufacture were largely irrelevant to
Pleistocene-early Holocene regional adaptive strategies.

[5] Ghosts of the Past: Reanalysis of Artifacts from Long Bay, San Salvador, Bahamas
Using archaeological collections to answer new questions often involves more than just analysis
or reanalysis of artifacts. Often it requires piecing together the research questions and
procedures used by the original investigator in producing the data. It also may require confronting
issues of long-term preservation of artifacts and the records that give the data meaning. This
paper will discuss how both the research agenda of the original excavator and the preservation of
the data at the Long Bay Site, San Salvador Island, Bahamas have influenced analysis of this
important contact-period site.

[143] Market Participation and Land Use Changes in a Prehistoric Maya Community: The Case of
Late Postclassic Buena Vista, Cozumel, Mexico
The late postclassic period (A.D 1200-1500) of the northeastern Maya lowlands is a period of
increasing market participation, movement of bulk goods, standardization of production, mass
production of basic household resources, and general coastal community growth. The use of
intensive forms of production and their role in settlement pattern decisions have been studied in
other regions and periods of the Maya lowlands. However, Late Postclassic agrarian production
organization, and its role in the spatial arrangement and distribution of coastal agrarian
communities is still poorly known. This paper presents some of the results of a settlement pattern
study conducted in the site of Buena Vista, Cozumel, Mexico. In this paper the author discusses
agrarian land use patterns during the late postclassic period to show how stone-wall demarcation
of the entire community landscape was used to increase agricultural and beekeeping production
in response to market demands.

[136] Producing the Political Landscape: Privileging Places and Practicing Social Differences in
Iron Age northern Karnataka
Despite the apparent absence of large-scale political authority during the South Indian Iron Age, it
is clear that a variety of practices oriented social relations toward strategic goals that created
social inequalities. Thus, I consider a broad range of past actions as political, specifically those
that negotiated access to the social and symbolic resources through which enabling social
differences were recreated. In this paper, I will argue that the production of differential access to
material and symbolic resources created unequal abilities to (re)constitute places and mobilize
labor, which effectively reauthorized privileged access and certain social relationships.

[62] Shifting meanings and functions in material culture: jadeite artifacts in prehistoric Japan
Jadeite artifacts were in high demand in Japan since the hunter-gatherer Jomon period. Derived
from one isolated source area at the Japan Sea Coast, they entered long-distance exchange
networks within Japan from at least 5500BP. However, the wider context of their creation,
transmission and role changed through time, as can be seen from excavated production and
consumption sites. The shift in their meaning and function starting between the Middle and the
Late Jomon (ca. 4000BP)—from ritual objects that benefited the whole community, to individually
owned ornaments and prestige goods— reflects broader changes in subsistence activities, social
structure and worldview.

[150] Rethinking Islands as Analytical Units: Regional Variation in Historic Burial Practices on San
Salvador, The Bahamas
Archaeologists working in the archipelagic nation of the Bahamas traditionally have used
contemporary geo-political entities as units of analysis. Employing individual islands as analytical
units has facilitated inter-regional comparisons, but also has likely normalized cultural and
material variations found on individual islands in the historic and prehistoric past. This paper
explores regional and local differences in late 19th and early 20th century cemetery monuments
on the island of San Salvador, The Bahamas. Comparisons among five local cemeteries from
diverse parts of the island have revealed the elaboration of local mortuary customs as well as
patterns of influence from around the island.

[158] Models of wetland formation and management in the Maya Lowlands
Based on more than 50 excavations from 2000 to 2008 we present two models of ancient Maya
wetland formation and use and compare these with existing models. These models derive from
multiple lines of evidence: geomorphology, soil chemistry, remote sensing, and ancient
management. The first model applies to where rising water tables submerged Preclassic fields
and Maya farmers adapted gradually by draining fields after the Late Preclassic. The second

abandoned in the Postclassic. These cases show significant diversity and complexity even over a

[45] Duality in Social Organization and the Origins of Complexity in Rural Bolivia
Investigations of inter-household socioeconomic patterns in two Tiwanaku-contemporary Bolivian
villages, Condor Chinoka and Jachakala, reveal long-term changes in their social and economic
organization, including incipient complexity at Jachakala. Broader theoretical implications are
discussed, and testable hypotheses generated for future work. I explore one in depth, that larger
social groupings, when synonymous with economic organizational units, can cooperatively take
greater advantage of wealth-generating activities than single households in a community. Thus
Andean duality inherent in ayllus and moieties may have facilitated incipient complexity, whereas
villages without marked intra-community divisions responded in less predictable ways to
opportunities for socioeconomic differentiation.

[44] A Case of Extinction in Intermountain Paleoindian Lithic Technology
Evolutionary accounts of technology tend to focus on innovation and transmission processes as
well as the selection conditions favoring the persistence of variant forms over time. At the other
end of the spectrum, of course, is extinction. Extinction can be viewed as the flip-side of selection,
that is, the success of one technology at the expense of another. Here we examine the process of
extinction with an example from the Paleoindian period in the Intermontane West, the selection
conditions that favored the persistence of biface technology at the expense of blade production,
resulting in the extinction of the latter.

This presentation provides an overview of the archaeological work conducted thus far at Fort
Shirley and summarizes data reflecting the daily practice of these distinct groups in relation to

[139] More than it was expected: preservational differences of epiphyseal ends and diaphysis of
guanaco (Lama guanicoe) long bones in Southern Patagonia
There is a trend in the archaeofaunas of open air sites from Southern Patagonia that shows long
bones epiphyseal ends outnumbering diaphysis. This runs counter expectations built on bone
structural density obtained from several scan sites. We propose that epiphyseal ends / diaphysis
dissimilar frequencies stands from taphonomic preservation differences related with long bone
structure, weathering (abrasion) at open air sites (mostly related with sandy substrates) in a
windy environment, and the less destructive behavior of Patagonian carnivores. Archaeological
implications are used in a comparative perspective in order to evaluate the relevance of
taphonomic-archaeological models constructed in other different settings.

[144] Roving Climatic Marginality and Population Movement: Farming Opportunities and
Constraints in the Middle and Upper San Juan Region
Maize agriculture is dependent on two primary environmental factors, water availability and
temperature, commonly discussed as frost-free growing season length. Throughout the Middle
and Upper San Juan region, climatic variability directly influenced crop production which, in turn,
may have caused societal stress, thereby dramatically influencing microregional migrations
during the Pueblo Period. This paper demonstrates how fluctuations in dendroclimatically
reconstructed precipitation patterns, interlaced with macro regional temperature fluctuations, both
“pushed” and “pulled” human settlements through time. We discuss how the interplay of
agricultural practices and climate shaped the character of human settlement along the Animas
River compared to the larger region.

success; this study uses a sample size of 25 specimens from known pre-horticultural and post-
horticultural periods to test its applicability on the island. Assuming these animals were garden

Palmetto ware is a distinctive Lucayan pottery that draws on Ostionan Ostionoid and Meillacan
Meillacoid decorative treatments, which reflect its cultural associations with homeland

resemble these contemporaneous types, but others, such as its shell temper sets it apart. Using

open air residential site on San Salvador, Bahamas, to determine whether the shell temper
comes from purposefully crushed shell, beach strand deposits, or clay matrix. We investigate
Lucayan agency through the lens of their ceramics: did the potters mimic non-Lucayan pottery
and try to reproduce it in a new environment or were they active innovators and why?

conjunction with those found in island fields, and in the intervening terrain.

Although the contexts and subject matter of early inscriptions is limited, it is clear that writing was
restricted to use by the king and the elite. As such, writing both was defined by and helped to
define this group.

[3] Later Stone Age settlements on the Red Sea Coast of Eritrea: Chronology, technology and
subsistence
This paper discusses technological variability, subsistence strategies and chronological
placement of recently investigated Late Stone Age sites from the Red Sea Coast of Eritrea.
Backed tools and prismatic blades characterize the lithic assemblages at the LSA sites. Abundant
mollusk shells were also recovered in association with lithic artifacts suggesting human
exploitation of marine resources. The excavated sites have produced radiometric dates ranging
between 5000 and 8000 years BP. These dates coincide with the early Mid-Holocene intermittent
dry periods. Such adverse scenarios may have triggered population diversification and periodic
migrations within the Horn of Africa and beyond. One possible explanation for the existence of
early to Mid-Holocene settlements along the Eritrean coast is that humans were attracted to
coastal habitats during the dry periods as resources in the interior of the Danakil depression
deteriorated. Human coastal settlements have been widely documented for this time period from
various regions of Africa and Eurasia. The results of this project bring new data on Holocene
coastal settlements in the Horn of Africa.

[6] Marine Origins of Maya Shell Trumpets
The act of naming renders historically remote artifacts manageable within the framework of
research. It also circumscribes the perception of the object or the concept to which the name

trumpets” offer such an example. The Maya made trumpets from the shells of six different
families of mollusks. A re-examination of the instrument, including biological data, offers the
opportunity to improve our understanding of this Maya instrument. A focus on biological data
allows for a “loosening” of the current historiographic “straitjacket” that “conch trumpets”
embodies.

addition, Compound 1 was the largest residence at Cerro Leon and was probably occupied by the
paramount ruling family of the Cerro Leon polity. The compound was divided into three spheres of
interaction: a private residential area consisting of patios, kitchens, and storage rooms, a
mortuary area associated with communal food preparation, and an area of large terraces for
public performances.

[88] Obsidian Hydration, Cut Sample Selection, and Technological Aspects of Debitage
Technological debitage analysis can be an aid in assessing discard context, as well as overall
site integrity. Related to this is the well-known use of obsidian hydration to identify scavenging
and reuse behaviors. Obsidian hydration cut locations are often determined in the obsidian lab;
for the most part, the archaeologist soliciting the hydration assessment does not select the
specific cut locations. By identifying features on the artifact that can be attributed to particular
technological techniques or methods and acquiring hydration measurements from these
locations, transformational processes and prehistoric behavior are better elicited. An example
from an archaeological site located in the Southern San Joaquin Valley of California is presented.

[113] Territoriality and Politics in the Prehistoric and Classical Aegean
Classicists are familiar with boundaries from texts and boundary markers. Disputes show the
‘active defence’ of public and private territory. Mostly this evidence comes from the introverted,
bellicose Classical city states, where awareness of land boundaries reflects overpopulation and
competitive endogamous ‘corporate communities’ (Dyson-Hudson and Smith 1978, Bintliff 1994,
1999). In the preceding Early Iron Age, or the farming prehistory of the Aegean is there evidence
for territoriality? The answer will vary by period, for insightful reasons. Moving forward to the
Roman Aegean dramatic changes point to different attitudes to territory, perhaps comparable to
modern globalization effects.

[153] More to the Point: Case Studies of Brewerton and Orient Projectile Production from Eastern
Massachusetts
In the Northeast, Brewerton and Orient projectile points are hallmarks of the Late Archaic and
Terminal Archaic periods. Research at two sites in the Concord and Shawsheen river drainages
shows these points being made from locally available material. The Boulder Trail Site produced
Brewerton points, scrapers, and chipping debris of one variety of rhyolite. The Shawsheen River
Site yielded an assemblage of rhyolite debitage and an Orient point that evidently was broken
and discarded during the manufacturing process. The implications of local manifestations of
regional styles are explored.

[9] Unraveling the Occupational History of Village Communities: A Unique Iroquoian Example
This paper examines the methods used to detect episodes of building and rebuilding at the
Mantle site, a sixteenth century Wendat (Huron) village in Ontario, the terminal site in a sequence
that represents approximately 200 years of community relocation and coalescence. Covering nine
acres and containing over ninety longhouses, it is one of the most complex Iroquoian villages
ever excavated. The superimposition of houses, variable durations of occupation and excavation
methods all provided challenges to the analysis, but the results show how the occupational
history of the site provides a better understanding of intra-site dynamics and processes of
community coalescence.

[166] Contexts for Decision-Making in Grinding Tool Use
Researchers commonly embrace superficial explanations of the presence of staple grinding tools
in archaeological sites. This lack of depth is an understandable response to the sparseness of
these artifacts and the consequent difficulties developing hard evidence of their associations with
different temporal and social contexts. Nonetheless, archaeologists should be aware that the use
of these artifacts often was predicated upon social, economic, and political factors which
extended far beyond the household and community. This paper explores some of the contexts
which influenced past grinding tool use and considers their implications for archaeological
research.

[68] Persistence or Resistance? Dissecting Colonial Yukatek Maya Religion and Social Identity
Formation
In discussions of colonial Yukatek Maya religion, scholars rarely deal with ritual practice in terms
of class, gender, or ethnicity. Colonial period ritual traditions are seen as either direct
descendants of Classic Maya culture or as indigenous hybrids of Christianity, rather than unique
social formations. Just as society was restructured, so were the religious institutions of the region.
In this way, religion became a tool of state ideology but also a space for indigenous resistance. In
this paper, we will examine religious traditions as in-situ formations, framed not only by Spanish
colonization but by indigenous practices of revitalization.

[175] Answering Key Questions with Geoarchaeology: ESR's Ability to Determine the Site Age
Electron spin resonance dating (ESR) can determine the age for mammalian tooth enamel,
terrestrial and marine mollusc shells, corals, foraminifera, and barnacles with 2-5% accuracy in
the time range from 3 Ma to 10 ka. Since each of these materials occurs in archaeological
contexts directly associated with artefacts and hominid remains, Paleolithic sites and those
containing hominid remains ranging from Australopithecines to Neanderthals can be dated.
Examples from several European Middle Paleolithic and Neanderthal cave sites and African ESA,
MSA, and LSA open-air and cave sites demonstrate the method's utility across a broad time and
contextual range.

[46] Exploring Mortuary Diversity at Mission Santa Catalina de Guale
Mortuary patterning at Spanish missions in La Florida is characterized by considerable diversity –

attempts have been made to explore fine-grained, diachronic, explanations for mortuary diversity.
In this paper I will examine the mortuary variability at Mission Santa Catalina de Guale (Georgia)

of grave goods and reconsidering the relationship between funerary treatment and sacred and
secular status in Spanish Florida.

scarcity and labor, polymorphs, isomorphs, hypermorphs, and atromorphs are forms of qualitative
artifact variation basic to scales of value. Context and distribution indicate that these forms of
qualitative artifact variation served as powerful metaphors that indexed and rationalized
qualitative social distinctions, thus creating scales of value among material things and the people

[143] The More Things Change… : Iron Age Re-Occupation of a Neolithic Landscape, a Case-
Study
This paper looks at the Iron Age occupation of the Ii paleo-estuary in Northern Ostrobotnia,
Finland. Findings within the last ten years indicate an active utilization of this area, which was
previously thought to have been abandoned during the pre-Roman Iron Age. This paper traces
how a sedentary maritime hunter-gatherer way of life shaped the physical and cultural landscape
of the later, more mobile Iron Age population. It also discusses how this re-use shapes the
archaeological record, and how re-use can be recognized and considered in regional studies.

[114] The Politics of Forgetting at Terminal Classic Las Canoas, NW Honduras
Recent excavations at the Late and Terminal Classic center of Las Canoas (AD 600-950)
revealed several sizable platforms that were purposefully entombed largely intact. Unlike most
cases of sequent construction, these late additions were not formally finished but were left as
rounded mounds even as adjoining buildings remained in use. This paper considers the
possibility that the buried structures were intentionally hidden from view as part of a realignment
of political allegiances that took place within Las Canoas in the early 9th century. The implications
of manipulating social memory for factional competition with Las Canoas are also considered.

almost half of the cave was surveyed and surface collected. The cave presents the most complex
and thorough going system of cave modifications, in addition to large ceramic and osteological
assemblages, that the author has seen in a quarter of a century of continuous field work. An
overview of the project’s work and a tentative interpretation of the results are presented here.

[152] Recent Investigations at Mound City Group, Ohio
During the summers of 2007 and 2008 archaeological investigations were conducted at a little-
known site just north of the Mound City Group earthworks. Site 33Ro338 was recorded as a
Middle Woodland habitation site. Plans to reforest the area renewed interest in the site and led to
a geophysical survey. Ground-truthing of anomalies yielded cultural features and artifacts,
including bladelets. Subsequent excavations focused on two areas-a linear anomaly, and a
circular anomaly within an alignment of five circular anomalies. Excavations found cultural
features dating to the Middle Woodland and representing specialized activities associated with
the use of the nearby earthworks.

The earliest European observers of native communities in southern New England describe

types reflect a movement towards greater social and economic inequality in the century prior to
the arrival of Europeans and discusses archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence in support.

Mounds
New South Associates has evaluated numerous black dirt midden sites in South Florida under the
auspices of the US Army Corps of Engineers. Well-preserved zooarchaeological assemblages
often comprise the bulk of the archaeological remains from these sites. These assemblages
suggest subsistence economies based primarily on the exploitation of local resources. Marine
species, though comparatively rare, comprise the bulk of the bone and shell tools.
Zooarchaeological study offers the opportunity to examine patterns of faunal exploitation in south
Florida. We synthesize these results and offer discussions of subsistence, resource exploitation,
seasonality, temporal variation, and site patterning.

[112] Language, Personhood, and Place
Drawing upon research in cognitive linguistics and Southwestern ethnography, the concepts of
personhood, exchange between persons (gifting), and relationships between beings and humans
in material exchanges are explored in a context of a cultural landscape where each exists.
Placiality has been insufficiently explored. Aspects of bodies are mapped onto the landscape, and
aspects of the landscape are mapped onto bodies in material objects, which are all mediated
through language. Just as persons have life spans, so do both natural and constructed objects.

[107] Inventing History? Toward an Archaeology of the Great Oromo Migration of 16th and 17th
Century Ethiopia
Although Ethiopia has >80 ethnic groups, most published narratives of indigenous Ethiopian
history draw almost exclusively upon the only two groups who have written histories, and who
have dominated Ethiopian politics for centuries. Many of these publications ignore or dismiss as
"inventions" the oral histories of other groups, effectively denying them their past and identity.
Here we demonstrate how recent archaeological and ethnohistoric research in the Gilgil Gibe
region of SW Ethiopia can help restore the history and identity of the Oromo and Yem people
through a more accurate portrayal of the "Great Oromo Migration" of the 16th-17th Centuries.

[140] Creolization: Modeling the Cultural Frontier
Recent definitions of the colonial frontier have emphasized it less as a boundary between

more distinct groups. This paper explores one model proposed by anthropologists to interpret the
product of this intercultural encounter, creolization, for free and enslaved communities living on
Virginia plantations and then applies it to archaeological and documentary data. The challenge
remains for archaeologists to decipher those patterns of material culture reflecting changes on
cultural frontiers from those mirroring broader social and economic trajectories.

carbonates. To the south and west are quarries developed in argillite, hornfels, tuff and basalt.
Jasper occurrences are notable within the city limits. Lack of prehistoric quarry recognition by the
archaeological community, in combination with ever increasing suburban development, presents
a one-two punch in the demise of a resource representing the cradle of prehistoric economies.

of the larger, more complex forts, these small sites suggest that military and religious sectors

placed along the pyramid’s central axis on this accumulation. It was associated with several
dozen pointed chert implements, likely bloodletters. The placement of a Postclassic altar in front
of the earliest documented pyramid at the site has implications for social memory of this sacred

social boundaries) both reflect (in their finished form) the contributions of, and helped (through
their construction), to define the social personae of disparate laboring groups.

piagi was a storable resource for the Owens Valley Paiute, notable for its relatively high fat and
protein content. Although difficult to detect with standard archaeological techniques, organic

[88] Building and Testing Predictive Models of Archaeological Site Types in Central Wyoming
Archaeological predictive models were constructed for various site types in central Wyoming
using GIS and stepwise logistic regressions. These models are tested using set-aside data
samples and ground truthing surveys. This poster presents the methods and model outputs,
which include several maps that forecast the locations of various site types, ranging from historic
debris scatters to prehistoric rock alignments. The models show the varied distribution of site
types in the region and will be used by land managers and developers to make more informed
decisions regarding the locations of forthcoming natural gas infrastructure.

[121] Reconstructing an Intermediate Household at Cerro Leon on the North Coast of Peru
This poster explores room function in Compound 3 at Cerro Leon. The compound, which was
completely excavated, is one of a small number of medium-sized residential compounds located
adjacent to the largest residence at the site, Compound 1. Although much smaller than
Compound 1, these compounds are several times larger than most residences at Cerro Leon.
Based on the spatial organization, architecture, interior features, and artifacts, specific domestic
activities conducted in rooms and patios were identified. Compound 3 provides an important
example of an intermediate noble residence of immigrant highlanders in the middle Moche Valley
during the Early Intermediate Period.

[17] The Development of Plant Cultivation in Northeast Texas
Recent analysis of macrofloral assemblages and pollen cores from northeast Texas have yielded
information about the emergence of plant cultivation there. Starchy and oily seeds cultivated
elsewhere in the Eastern Woodlands appear only minimally in Woodland (Fourche Maline)
contexts in northeast Texas, but they increase over time. Pollen profiles indicate a xeric climactic
episode prior to the Caddo period. Wood charcoal at the Gene and Ruth Ann Stallings Site
(41LR297) indicates decreased use of floodplain genera for fuel between Woodland and Early
Caddo times, suggesting clearance of those areas for plant cultivation. Nutshell:wood ratios
indicate decreasing use of nut mast.

[29] Intra-Tooth Isotopic Analysis and Hypoplasia Aetiology: Implications for Late Holocene Bison
Health and Human Subsistence on the Northwestern Great Plains
Among Late Pleistocene-Late Holocene Northwestern and Central Great Plains bison, dental
enamel hypoplasia (DEH), a well-recognized environmental and metabolic stress response, is
morphologically and seasonally consistent. Deviations are rare and imply regular, localized
physiological strain. However, one specimen from the Late Holocene Big Goose Creek site
(Wyoming) displays a comparatively abnormal occurrence that perhaps suggests a more
systemic trauma. Here, stable carbon and oxygen intra-tooth isotopic analysis is employed to: (1)
evaluate DEH aetiology and, (2) elucidate the effects of potentially aberrant environmental
conditions on bison health and human bison-based subsistence.

[191] Identifying Local Indigenous Agency through the Material Manifestations of Resistance in
Northern Ecuador
According to Spanish chroniclers, Inka rulers during the early part of the sixteenth century were
captivated by the expanse of the Empire’s northern frontier. Ambitious attempts were made to
conquer these verdant lands – only to be met by waves of indigenous resistance. The chronicles
reveal detailed accounts of the colonial encounters that occurred between the Inka and local
indigenous peoples of northern Ecuador, however, discrepancies between written documents and
material evidence often result in the contestation of the narratives of history. The aim of this paper
is to mediate these various lines of evidence and to demonstrate the ways in which the
documented narratives of local agency and resistance can be identified through the material
remains present at various sites along the Pambamarca complex.

This paper will discuss refuse related to jade production in Classic Maya domestic middens and
whether that refuse was truly “garbage” as we know it. While garbage contexts are often
associated with household refuse – faunal remains, broken pottery, obsidian and chert debitage,
and groundstone fragments – they are also a place for ritual caching related to craft production,
potential termination rituals, and even occasional interment of human remains. These findings
have compelled us to begin refining our ideas of what constitutes “garbage” in the archaeological
record as well as how the Maya may have perceived, created, and utilized these deposits.

[61] Migration and Cultural Transmission: Exploring the Role of the Captive
This paper argues that archaeologists should widen the focus of their models of cultural
transmission to recognize the contributions of captives to culture change. Captives, especially
captive women, were a common social role in many prehistoric societies, especially those
involved in frequent or endemic warfare, a situation that characterizes both the American
Southwest after A.D. 1150 and post-Roman Europe. Captives brought with them a repertoire of
technological skills, symbol systems, religious practices, social customs, and languages that were
available for adoption by their captors. In spite of low social standing, captives could be potent
vectors of culture change.

collections, including a newly curated assemblage at Brigham Young University, recovered from
Fourmile Ruin, Arizona. The analysis combines use wear and design structure data to infer the
original context of presentation and the possible ideological correlates of bowl interior motifs.

This paper looks at how the imperial politics and trade economy of Mughal South Asia is directly
reflected in architectural forms constructed along the Grand Trunk Road. Architecture sets the
stage for political and economic activities and is contingent in social identity formation and
maintenance. Looking specifically at imperial constructions of Mosques, Temples, Kos Minars,
and Caravanserais I explore the uses of these structures and the information they contain
regarding the religion, economy, and politics of the Mughal period. Architectural spaces when
charged with social meaning structure the activities of travelers, traders and locals creating social

integral patterning practices in the creation of civilization. My paper will explore the civilizing
processes of violence - no less than the story of "civilization" in ancient China -through changing
political forms, ordering rituals and transformations of violence as reflected in inscriptions, burials

[165] Interpreting Shell Midden Size on the Northwest Coast of North America
Marine invertebrate exploitation on the Northwest Coast of North America began over 9,000
years ago, but large shell middens generally date after 4,000 years ago. Inferences about
population size or intensification of hunter gatherer economies cannot be made on this basis
without controlling for several factors. Variation in temporal distribution and duration of middens at
the regional scale is argued to be strongly influenced by stability of sea level and shoreline
landforms. More study of accumulation rates and the structure of activity areas within sites is
needed to support intersite comparisons and inferences about changing settlement patterns and
social organization.

In this paper we present results of the taxonomic identification and bone modification analysis of
archaeofaunal remains recovered from the site of Pirque Alto located in the Cochabamba Lower
Valley. The faunal assemblage includes a preponderance of domesticated camelids followed by a
range of microfauna. Camelids were not part of the local fauna and had to be transported to the
site. In addition, specimens of exotic taxa from the tropical lowlands were identified. The analyzed
faunal assemblage suggests Pirque Alto was engaged in multiple exchange complimentary
circuits between different ecoregions originated during the Formative Period and reinforced

[2] Indigenous Mesoamerican Conquerors in Central America
The sixteenth-century conquest of Mesoamerica is often called the “Spanish Conquest.” Yet
much of the fighting, dying, and colonizing on the “Spanish” side was done by Mesoamericans.
Thousands of men joined the Spanish-led expeditions into Central America and beyond, followed
soon in some cases by their relatives and compatriots. Using archaeological and documentary
evidence from two Ciudad Vieja towns (Almolonga in Guatemala and San Salvador in El
Salvador) we examine the importance of this generation of indigenous conquerors, their impact in
the new colonies, and the larger forces that merged them with the people they had once
conquered.

[175] Paleogeography of the Late Pleistocene and Quaternary Coastlines of Southeast Alaska
and their potential Archaeological Significance
Literature search/field reconnaissance produced a dataset of 327 shell-bearing raised-marine
deposits throughout Southeast Alaska, including site location, elevation, description, and 180
radiocarbon dates beginning at 14,380 BP. Interpretation of this data gives insight in the timing
and complexity of isostatic crustal adjustments from glaciation/deglaciation, eustatic sealevel
change, subsequent tectonic uplift, and the ability to plot sealevel through time and space. The
data suggests ice loading during the LGM resulted in a forebulge west of the ice front. Forebulge
collapse after deglaciation and rising sea levels provide one explanation for the absence today of
coastal archaeological sites prior to 10,300 B.P.

[128] The Organization of Early Archaic Technology in the Southeast
The Early Archaic in the Southeast is viewed as a period dominated by small, egalitarian bands,
large territorial ranges, and a high degree of mobility. Territorial ranges became increasingly
restricted over time due to population growth. Bands of related individuals periodically came
together for social and ceremonial purposes, and information exchange. This traditional as
presented in many general overviews is challenged here using an organization of technology
approach and lithic data from a number of sites. While hampered due to the lack of comparative
data, it is clear the Early Archaic is more varied and complex than traditionally inferred.

performance. While this is surely the case in some instances, this theory fails to account for

for? This paper explores how the presence of text was an important component of its agency and

features of the landscape and behavioral performance characteristics recorded in pictographs, a
large numbers of projectile points, and ethnohistoric records, prevalent site selection practices
and epistemic frameworks are articulated.

nuanced approach. By incorporating various archaeological and bioarchaeological methods, I will
show how gender in early medieval France (c. AD 500-700) can challenge our modern Western
notions of gender during this time period.

Even though war and conflict are evident in the development of the early Moche states form
Jequetepeque, long periods of peace and stability must have been common. In this presentation
we examine the multiple political strategies alternative to war and endemic conflict in the
structuring of the opportunistic states that characterize this region. Social interactions (marriage
and migration), inter polity relations, and ideological activities are analyzed in a regionally
restricted scale to reveal the complexity of this society.

[90] Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP): Cultural Resources Mitigation
Strategies
A number of strategies have been developed to mitigate the potential impacts to cultural
resources from the landscape level CERP projects. While each site is unique and potential
impacts may be different there are a number of general mitigation strategies that can be applied.
Project specific examples will be used to illustrate the strategies used for the CERP projects.
These measures include; project modification to avoid and minimize effects, operational
monitoring to insure that avoidance measures are effective, single site mitigation and site cluster
mitigation. Some of these measures have been implemented others are still being developed.

[107] Moving from the Deterministic to the Ideological: GIS as a Post-Processual Tool for
Understanding the Past in East Africa
Although a powerful utility for spatial analysis and computer modeling, GIS is often criticized as a
strictly processual tool for interpreting the past. Not only are ideological factors excluded in many
archaeological applications of GIS, but also the voice and perspective of indigenous societies.
Unilinear translations notwithstanding, the flexibility of GIS allows for the inclusion of plenary
datasets garnered from interdisciplinary approaches, including those obtained from societies
living in the present. Using Hodder’s ideas concerning ‘relational analogies’, this paper explains
how GIS can be used as a post-processual tool for interpreting precolonial pastoralist behavior on
the Laikipia Plateau, Kenya.

[99] Lacustrine Snail Shells, Postclassic Maya, and Local Central Peten Trade
Investigating local trade networks of the central Peten Postclassic Maya contributes to
understanding the fusion-fission nature of various socio-political groups as they vied for territory
and dealt with European expansion. Studying the area's most common pottery ware adds to this
knowledge. INAA suggests that local trade patterns exist because of differences in the pottery's
chemical composition. However, statistically-significant chemical compositional groups do not
occur because of the high frequency of calcium. This poster demonstrates that with the addition
of Thermal Ionization Mass Spectroscopy, archaeologists can use the shell inclusions from the
Snail-Inclusion Paste ware pottery to better understand local trade.

[10] Fragmentation, transformation, and cremation rituals among the Hohokam of Southern
Arizona
Hohokam cremations often have low weights and explanations of this pattern have varied. An
archaeological example of the division of an individual into at least two secondary cremations is
documented. This finding is discussed within an approach that includes how fragmentation of the
body during cremation could lead to a more complex network of social relationships. Also,
transformation(s) of an individual identity can occur through the burning of the individual and post-
cremation rituals. Among the methodological implications, the reevaluation of paleodemographic
profiles in past cremation studies is necessary and an attempt at refitting between cremations is
suggested.

[170] Variability and Significance of Miniature Vessels from Huaca Loro: A Multi-Disciplinary
Examination
Small, handmade, ceramic vessels traditionally called crisoles are often found in large numbers in
prehispanic elite tombs on the north coast. These miniature vessels pale in artistic and technical
qualities in comparison with associated metal and other types of grave goods and usually receive
little attention. This paper presents results of systematic analysis of shape, paste and firing, as
well as contents of the vessels, and organization and distribution of vessels within tombs.
Together with variation in firing and paste, the diversity of food residues found suggests similarly
diverse funerary participants.

Enterprise-scale relational databases are well established in Cultural Resource Management
archaeology. As these technologies become more available and usable, opportunities for

priorities. At the Georgia Archaeological Site File, we have new opportunities in our recently

The Iron Age of the Eurasian Steppe has been characterized as marking the beginnings of the
social formation of pastoral nomadic confederacies that dominated the steppe through ranked
clans and elite leadership. Over the past decade and a half our research on Iron Age settlements
suggests that the crops such as millet, wheat, barley and rice contributed to semi-sedentary or
sedentary systems of livestock husbandry. While elite leadership appeared to be based on
military prowess and “nomadic traditions,” community organization of the Talgar Iron Age
settlements had its foundation in an agro-pastoral economy.

[97] The Proxemics of Public and Private Space at the Colonial Period Settlement of Malata, Peru
This paper presents preliminary findings from excavations of three Colonial buildings at Malata.
Structure 15 was an administrative structure; structure 26 was an elite residence; and structure
28 likely restricted access to a courtyard in front of the elite residence. Although artifacts alone
can be used to confirm a building’s function, a clearer picture develops when structures are
evaluated against a settlement plan that is preconceived. At Malata, proximity to the Spanish
plaza reinforced a strict social order, one that probably resonated with a spatial hierarchy
between civic-ceremonial, public, and domestic spaces at the site during Inkaic times.

[171] An Examination of Indigenous Settlement Dynamics in the Upper Middle Rio Grande Valley
from Spanish Entrada Accounts
Archeological evidence indicates that ancestral Pueblo Indian settlement of the Upper Middle Rio
Grande Valley from the period AD 1300-1500 involved annual cycles of aggregation during winter
at village centers, population dispersal across the landscape from spring through fall to engage in
agriculture and other resource procurement activities, and frequent population relocation between
villages in response to longer term climatic cycles affecting sub-regional resource productivity.
Entrada chronicles are examined to evaluate whether this model of seasonal aggregation and
dispersal, and longer term cycles of abandonment and relocation, was still operating in the 16th
and early 17th centuries.

Despite almost two centuries of research, little attention has actually been devoted to
understanding the origins of Hopewell. “Hopewell” is a creation of modern archaeology, and an
understanding of the origin of Hopewell lies in the recent past. Nevertheless, the temporally- and
geographically-bounded series of events and processes archaeologists have amalgamated as
Hopewell does bear investigation. It will be argued that the efflorescence of earthwork
construction, mortuary ritual, and exchange of non-local materials identified as Hopewellian may
be seen as manifestations of social and political activities (negotiations, contestations) in the
unique conditions of a particular point in Eastern Woodland prehistory.

In concert with contemporary concerns over climate change, drought has again become
popularized as the reason for the collapse of Classic Maya civilization. However, the broad
strokes that have been used to paint a model of drought and its consequences do not accurately
reflect regional peculiarities, being based on incomplete dating and selective archaeological data.
While extended drought would have impacted the Maya, it should not be posited as the primary
reason for the abandonment of all Classic Period cities. Archaeological data from the central
Peten and Caracol, Belize, are used to show why the pan-Maya drought model is ill-conceived.

they contained humanly accessible space in their interior. The careful investigation of these
features revealed heavy utilized and, in one case, extensive modification with architecture.
Several smaller speleothem enclosures were reported at Naj Tunich indicating that this may be a
previously unrecognized pattern of speleothem utilization.

A monumental entrance was discovered west of the goddess Tlatecuhtli monolith. This access
has the shape of an inverted pyramid, formed by four levels. When we explored the entrance we
discovered that this space is comprised of four constructive stages or expansions, implicating that
it was used for about 30 years. Thus, our calculation dates the entrance from the reign of Ahuízotl
until soon after the arrival of the Spaniards. The presence of both intact and broken seals
demonstrates that the space was used on different occasions. Further, the finding of three
temporally distinct offerings suggests the celebration of several ceremonies of exceptional
character. In this paper we will discuss the symbolism function of this ritual space, as well as the
ceremonial activities that took place there.

demonstrates that the social meaning of salt transformed from a prestige good to a more general

[84] Dating the Chauvet Cave Art
Since its discovery in December 1994, the art of the Chauvet Cave (France) has become famous
for its mastery and its sophistication. The initial radiocarbon dates obtained in 1995
(ca.31,000BP) placed it within the Aurignacian. This went counter the current paradigms about
the supposed evolution of Pleistocene art from crude beginnings in the Aurignacian to more and
more sophistication in later cultures. It thus gave rise to some controversy -which has never
stopped- as to the validity of the 14C dates. The scientific team at work at Chauvet has pursued
different lines of research to establish when the cave could be and was actually frequented by
both humans and bears: geology (dating the collapse of the cliff that sealed the entrance;
studying the evolution of the cave surfaces), paleontology (the bears in the cave and their
possibilities of getting into it), dating of the calcite covering archaeological levels, dating of torch
marks on the walls, dating of the images themselves, study and dating of the charcoal on the
ground, intercomparison study by several laboratories to test the validity of the radiocarbon
datings obtained, etc. After the collective work thus carried out during a decade, we can assert
that the art of the Chauvet Cave is one of the best -if not the best-securely dated in the world.

[82] Engendering Military Site Archaeology
Military sites operate on a strict hierarchical structure historically conceived of as a male habitué.
Military sites are typically interpreted as a male domain. The view of the feminine gender in such
a setting is either one of near invisibility or in a subservient role as officers’ wives, laundresses or
camp followers. The archaeological collections and historical records from Fort Snelling,
Minnesota have helped define social and functional distinctions within a military context and
enhance our understanding of gender and class. Fort Snelling data suggest that expectations
based on task differentiation must be interpreted on the basis of specific historic contexts rather
than the use of generalized models based on assumed gender universals.

Studies of structural violence indicate health disparities are normalized through their embedding
in social structures. Mississippian-period health disparities in North America have been broadly
consigned to an “epidemiological transition” linked to the adoption of agriculture. Uncritically
accepted, this view elides the historical actions that propagate disease, thereby making it seem
inevitable. Representational and osteological studies show that Mississippian warfare
transformed the periodic threat of physical violence into a chronic setting of structural violence,
manifested by infectious and non-infectious stressors. This duality of violence was
institutionalized through seemingly contradictory embodied practices that valorized warfare yet
instilled a dread of bodily defilement.

objects show up and how they gather the world around them. In particular I will demonstrate the

studies and instead explore the complicated intersection of place, materials, material practices
and the production of identity at different scales.

[145] What’s in an abundance index: ethnoarchaeological insights from Martu foraging
Archaeological investigations into human-prey interactions frequently examine diachronic trends
using abundance indices (AI), or ratios of large bodied prey relative to small bodied prey.
Assuming that prey body size serves as a proxy for post-encounter return rate (whether the
currency is calories or prestige), a change in AI represents a change in foraging return rates
resulting from variation in the abundance of large prey. Utilizing a combination of ecological and
ethnoarchaeological data from the Western Desert of Australia, we test the validity of using
abundance indices as proxy measures of prey abundance.

This paper shall focus upon the role of jade in the pre-classical site of La Blanca. The site of La
Blanca has long been a source of fascination while studying the political cycling of the area, as
archaeologists have considered its nascent role on the Pacific Coast. This look at the use of jade
as currency in the households can help us gleam insight into the period, as well as gain
considerable comprehension on the use of the principal prestige good of the Pacific Coast of
Guatemala.

[174] Histories of Injustice on the Fringe of the Kgalagadi, Botswana
Archaeological interpretation often “speaks” for those that no longer have a voice or find
themselves silenced. This project—an investigation of the complex relationships between
foragers and farmers on the fringe of the Kgalagadi desert in southeastern Botswana over the
past few thousand years—is an attempt to speak for subaltern groups in the past and present.
Archaeological analyses and oral traditions reveal the complex contact relationships that
developed, and serve to empower groups in the present, as history shows a richly colored past
that stands in contrast to accounts of minority group histories in the present.

[15] A Northern Moche Paradox: The Absence of Warfare Imagery in the San Jose de Moro
Fineline Substyle
Despite the presence of fortified Late Moche sites that dot the Jequetepeque Valley, imagery
directly related to warfare is lacking in the local painted ceramic tradition, which has recently been
termed the “San Jose de Moro substyle.” Although many sites are characterized by having
strategic locations, defensive walls, and sling stones, this regional Moche art style provides few
images of human combat. I propose that this relates to a unifying function of the San Jose de
Moro substyle’s iconographic scheme, through which a focus on supernatural content allowed a
loose confederacy of Northern Moche groups to participate in communal rituals held at the
Jequetepeque’s ceremonial center, San Jose de Moro.

[179] Risk and hunter-gatherer toolkit structure in northwestern North America
It has been suggested that the diversity and complexity of hunter-gatherer toolkits increase as
risk of resource failure increases. Here, we report a study that tested this hypothesis with data
from 16 hunter-gatherer groups living in two geographically close but environmentally contrasting
regions of North America, the Northwest Coast and Plateau. Because the Plateau has lower
species richness and a more extreme climate than the Northwest Coast, our expectation was that
the Plateau groups’ toolkits would be significantly more diverse and complex than those of the
Northwest Coast groups. The results of the analysis were not consistent with this prediction.

[126] Monuments and Sculpture: a proposed workflow for the documentation of Mesoamerican
heritage
Carved stone monuments and sculpture long out of the ground or recently discovered face
variable permanency of over time. Threats include natural processes, such as erosion, acid rain,
pollution and root intrusion. Other, cultural or anthropogenic factors are also factors, such as
vandalism, graffiti, and looting. All of these processes decrease the visibility of an object or
monument, or make them impossible to fully document and appreciate for the future. Using
numerous examples from Guatemala and Mexico, the authors discuss a proposed workflow for
complete documentation that uses best available technologies to preserve and present
archaeological heritage.

A common cosmological notion in ancient Mesoamerica was the idea of four sky bearers, each
assigned a specific color and direction, who had the important duty of holding the firmament
securely in place. In Late Postclassic Central Mexico these were the sky bearers appearing in the
Borgia and Vaticanus B codices. To the Classic and Postclassic Maya, they were known as the
Bacabs and closely related Pauahtuns. Directional wind and rain gods were also closely related
and similar directional conceptions are found among the Pueblo and Navajo of the American
Southwest.

 [176] An Assessment of Late Puebloan Socio-Economic Dynamics in the Trans-Pecos Region.
Excavations at 41EP1623, El Paso County, Texas
Displacement of puebloan populations and resettlement into small autonomous communities after
A.D. 1300 reflects a cultural process accelerated by intra-annual changes in precipitation and
resource incongruence. As such, the movement from regionally aggregated polities located along
alluvial settings to the low-lying environment of the Hueco Bolson is interpreted as a shift in social
and economic dynamics within the Trans Pecos region. Excavations carried out at 41EP1623, a
puebloan settlement in El Paso County documents the resettlement of small communities back
into a once heavily occupied region of the Chihuahuan Desert. This change in settlement and an
increased reliance on non-domesticated foods may relate to a decrease in seasonal rainfalls and
an increase in resource incongruity across the region.

from the site of La Tiza
Pottery from the site of La Tiza was analyzed using Neutron Activation to examine changing
patterns of production over 1500 years. Beginning in the Early Horizon (100 BC) a variety of
materials were used and production appears unspecialized. In the Early Intermediate (AD 1-750)
the majority of polychrome pottery was made from a single clay source indicating centralized
production. During the Middle Horizon (AD 750-1000), when the Wari state integrated parts of
Nasca, the clay sources changed and there were new zones of production. After the collapse of
Wari, there was a return to sources used in the Early Intermediate.

[28] Professionalism in forensic archaeology: Transitioning from ‘cowboy of science’ to ‘officer of

Forensic science is science applied to the law. To be effective forensic scientists, archaeologists
need to learn what constitutes the elements of the crimes they might deal with, how to create
documentation for court and how to qualify as, and be, an expert witness. They may also deal
with many types of artifacts, or evidence, not normally found on an archaeological site. This
presentation takes a forensic case example from the initial call to the archaeologist by the police
to the courtroom and highlights the similarities and differences between anthropological
archaeology and forensic archaeology. Forensic archaeology is a sub-discipline that requires not
only a strong background in archaeological fieldwork, but additional training in the forensic
sciences.

Anthropogenic landscape fire provides an important parameter for understanding human-

relationship between anthropogenic fire and population density as subsistence
intensification/extensification constrained by political economy, climatic variability, and ecological
potential. Effective anthropogenic fire yields desired two results: (1) increased productivity and (2)
decreased risk. This framework hypothesizes that functional anthropogenic fire practices balance
population requirements and political economic demands with potential ecological productivity
while mediating social and ecological risk.

[118] Hierarchy, Communalism, and Transegalitarian Foraging Practices: Some Northwest Coast
Examples
The complex hunter-gatherers of the Northwest Coast practiced communal foraging, but they did
so within hierarchical social structures that emphasized household and even individual ownership
of resources. In this paper, I look at three examples of Northwest Coast communal foraging:
Straits Salish reef-netting, Nuu-chah-nulth whaling, and Tsimshian eulachon fishing. I argue that
the various practices associated with each of these foraging activities simultaneously reinforced
principles of social hierarchy and communalism. I suggest further that the inherent tensions
between hierarchy and communalism were negotiated and, to a certain extent, resolved at these
facilities.

“typical” Tiwanaku burial. We propose, instead, that mortuary activities in this area must be
understood not only in terms of differences in social identity (including age, gender, class, and
ethnic affiliation), but also vis-à-vis the specific local history of the Mollo Kontu neighborhood and
broad changes in Tiwanaku’s urban landscape.

[119] An inventory and analysis of the Qochas (reservoirs) in the Rio Ramis, Peru.
Qochas are a precolumbian landscape agricultural feature about which very little is known.
Though there are thousands of these reservoirs visible on the landscape of the northern Lake
Titicaca Basin, qochas have yet to be systematically and quantitatively researched. Using a
combined approach of GPS and remote sensing, we present the first systematic inventory of
qâ€™ochas attempted in Peru. We report the total number of qochas in the study area and
identify spatial patterning both in the location of qochas on the landscape and in their association
with archaeological sites of specific temporal periods.

[56] Separating Church and State: Rethinking Mississippian Ideology and Politics in the Northern
Caddoan Area
Owing to various attempts to explain the development, maintenance, and diversity of
Mississippian societies, the notion of what ‘Mississippian’ is has become inextricably linked with
but a single type of political strategy: hierarchically organized chiefdoms. In this paper I argue that
while centralized political leaders likely played a significant role in many Mississippian
communities, the Mississippian ideology itself was not inherently tied to any particular political
strategy. A critical reexamination of data from two neighboring mound sites in eastern Oklahoma
casts doubt on the presence of chiefly hierarchies in the Northern Caddoan Area despite obvious
connections and similarities with the wider Mississippian southeast.

[85] Far from the Shore: The role of Marine Resources in the Late Archaic (3000 to 1800 B.C.)
Norte Chico Region of Peru
There are numerous agricultural sites with monumental architecture dating to the Late Archaic
Period (30001800 BC) in the Norte Chico region of Peru. Testing at 13 of these yields few
remains of terrestrial animals and substantial quantities of fish bone and marine invertebrates.
Though it appears that marine resources provided the protein in most people’s diet, we compare
midden contents to look at the variability between sites near the coast and those further inland.
The evidence shows that these are basically agriculturally based societies who balanced their
diet by relying on the rich marine resources from the adjacent Pacific Ocean.

[86] The social production of space in third millennium cities of Upper Mesopotamia
The cities of third millennium Upper Mesopotamia are variously described as “organic” or “highly
planned,” and assigned to type categories based on their general shape and structure. This
approach fails to capture the pathways of urban development. In contrast, I analyze these cities
through the lens of a life history approach that emphasizes how various stakeholders participate
in urban planning at multiple levels within the city. Over time, local planning episodes, combined
with centralized planning, creates a collage of urban spaces that maintains conservative notions
of the social production and construction of space.

[108] Teotihuacan, Tula, and the View from the Texcoco Hinterlands
The central highlands of Mexico offer an excellent geographic setting for the archaeological
investigation of cycles of state development and reorganization. Taking a long-term perspective,
we present archaeological data from the small regional center of Cerro Portezuelo during the
height of the successive expansionary states of Classic Teotihuacan and Early Postclassic Tula.
Comparison of ceramic assemblages, mortuary practices, and architectural data between these
regional capitals and Cerro Portezuelo reveals contrasting patterns of participation in imperial
socio-political and economic activities for each state's development. By taking a diachronic
perspective, this study contributes to an improved understanding of the varied perceptions,
responses, and strategies of hinterland residents under conditions of political subordination.

In this paper we describe an analysis of faunal remains from rural Nasca settlements. Multiple
strategies of camelid herd maintenance may have been practiced during the Early Nasca Period,
including herding at the local village, herding in the puna, and transhumance. Isotopic analysis of
carbonate and collagen samples from the faunal assemblage provides data on camelid diet and
herding altitude. This research adds insight to the complexity of early Nasca lifeways, including

[141] Breaking the bounded self: apotropaic devices in 17th century England
Interpreting the breaking of images within the frame of iconoclasm is to endow the act of
breakage with a negative moral valuation. Iconoclasm is implicitly understood as a form of
violence. Iconoclash opens up the possibility to deepen and widen our understanding of why
people make and break objects. This paper turns to 17th century England to discuss the breaking
of apotropaic devices made from common and mass-produced Bartmann jugs. These ‘witch
bottles’ demonstrate the power of the broken image to articulate anxieties over bodily integrity in
the context of the coming into being of a bounded sense of self.

[176] Synergy: The Whole is Greater than the Sum of the Parts
Reconstructing past lifeways requires multiple and sometimes extraordinary analyses. To rely
upon single lines of evidence is often to ignore important parts of our prehistory. Establishment of
a paleoenvironmental record, along with records of people's choices for food, is essential to
understanding daily life. Archaeology is more than our finds of lithics and ceramics, and records
of lipids, pollen, seeds, phytoliths, and other debris, whether perishable or durable. Examples of
the synergy of multiple lines of evidence provides a more comprehensive understanding of the
diet and people's lives, such as analysis of Mesa Verde mugs, FCR for organic residue, etc.

the Santa Clara Valley of Chihuahua, Mexico. Pedestrian surveys along first and second terraces
of the river between Santa Clara and Ortega identified over 50 new sites, including archaic lithic
scatters and several moderately-sized Medio Period occupations, including two fortified hilltop
sites and one I-shaped ballcourt. In general, settlement along the valley seems related to the
presence of low-lying agricultural terraces and freshwater springs.

foreign archaeologists (UK, US and Australia). Outreach was in villages of Pathapadu,
Jwalapuram, and Kottala where we have been conducting open-air, rockshelter and cave
excavations. Challenges included barriers of language and social customs. Activities included a
brochure in Telugu, teaching and conducting interviews about their history and use of the
landscape. Villagers responded by aiding in fieldwork, protecting sites, assisting with identification
and interpretation of sites, including rockart. Media covered our archaeological research,
highlighting culture heritage and current destruction of sites.

[116] Mortuary Practices and Social Complexity in the Delaware Valley of the Middle Atlantic
Region
Late Woodland and Contact/Historic period mortuary practices are summarized and provide a
perspective on community and regional social organization and interaction. While the native
peoples of the Delaware Valley are believed to have lived in autonomous bands made up of
extended families, mortuary rituals were probably set at the clan or tribal/macro-band level. Some
cemeteries or burial areas may have been shared among these bands indicating that funerals
may have brought neighboring bands together. This perspective is compared and contrasted with
inferences derived from settlement and community patterns, subsistence practices, and data
related to exchange and group interaction.

[141] Killing Mummies
Why bother killing a mummy? This paper explores the political implications of Inka views of
sentience and power, in which humans and various forms of consciousness were inhabitants of
the world. People, clippings from their bodies, and their mummies were seen as living icons of
dividuated personas in which human consciousness resided. Within this conceptual framework,
the Inkas were highly selective in what could or ought to be represented in tangible form and thus
what could be manipulated physically or even destroyed. It is argued that the apparent severity of
Inka materiality is explicable because 1) power was resident in various living forms, and 2) iconic
representations rendered their subjects susceptible to malign forces."

is highly probable that human impact played a crucial role for sediment delivery.

[58] Using Distributional Archaeology and GIS to Determine Functionality of Subsurface
Structures Detected with Geophysics at El Baul
The integration of multiple sets of data including geophysical data, surface collection data and
data collected with a GPS into a GIS software program provides for dynamic spatial and
associative analysis when examining the archaeological record. ArcGIS provides tools that allow
you to overlay multiple types of data and compare them spatially and statistically. Correlating
distributions of surface artifacts with the spatial orientation of subsurface features detected with
geophysical instrumentation such as ground penetrating radar (GPR) and magnetometry provide
a test for hypotheses concerning the frequency and distribution of artifact classes and the
information that they provide about the function of a particular area of archaeological interest. The
integration of multiple kinds of data sets in GIS is employed in this study in order to determine the
relationship between the distribution and densities of surface artifacts and possible structure
detected with geophysical instruments. I collected the data from an area of archaeological interest
known as El Baul in Santa Lucia Cotzumalguapa, Guatemala. Data recovered from survey with
both GPR and Magnetometry was used to identify the location of possible subsurface structure
foundations. Areas of interest were then divided into 5 x 5 m grids and artifacts within each grid
were sorted and counted. The grids locations as well as the location of large rocks within the
grids were recorded using GPS. A topographic map was also generated with the GPS. Each of
these datasets was then imported into ArcGIS and correlated using statistical and spatial analysis
tools to determine the relationship between the distribution of artifacts on the surface and the
structures detected in the subsurface.

In the Maya Lowlands of Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, wetlands, known locally as bajos,

Archaeologists describe bajos as seasonal swamps containing marsh-like vegetation. Yet,
swamps and marshes represent two different kinds of wetland features, each providing different
natural resources. My research compares characteristics of bajos and other water-holding
depressions found in Mesoamerica to wetland categories used by the U.S. Environmental

and to explore potential implications of wetland variation for prehispanic human adaptations.

Mesoamerica contains many lithic raw materials including obsidian, which appeared as one of the

most important deposits can be related to the development of large distance trade and
specialized craft productions. Archaeological studies highlight complex mining systems but the
modern exploitation of several of the deposits destroys gradually the pre-Hispanic remains. The
paper presents the available data about pre-Hispanic mines and quarries, focusing on the field
work methodology and the nomenclature used.

separation of urban versus pastoral activities necessitating meat-provisioning, Classic Tiwanaku
populations kept close contact with the herds. In the case of the Muru Ut Pata area, maintaining

[114] Socio-natural Patterns and Processes of Community Integration in the Palmarejo Valley,
Honduras
In archaeological studies of communities in Mesoamerica, attention is mostly paid to
reconstructing and understanding the social aspects of community integration. Far less work has
been done to discern how the biophysical environment shapes and shifts human interactions in
communities over time. In this paper we discuss our research in the Palmarejo Valley of
northwestern Honduras, which examines the ways and extent to which communities were
integrated by micro-watersheds. Data from settlement survey, excavation, pottery analysis, and
geoarchaeological research suggest that quebradas and their changing impacts to local
landforms played a crucial role in community form, function, and identity.

[146] Landscapes Shared and Contested: Tracing Proto-Athabascan and Inuit Land Use in the
Southern Keewatin District of Nunavut
Archaeologists comparing the adaptiveness of Chippewyan Dene and Caribou Inuit
subsistence/settlement systems have argued that among the Caribou Inuit, the concepts of
relatively permanent winter occupations, subsistence on stored foods, and the construction of
features and facilities, were derived from practices brought inland from the coast, and whose
origins lay in their Thule ancestry. However, recent archaeological research in the southern
Keewatin indicates that the ancestors of the Chippewyan Dene may have overwintered north of
the treeline in well-constructed semi-subterranean houses. We examine how this discovery
challenges previously held ideas about First Nations and Inuit patterns of land use and
occupancy in this region.

[172] Human Remains from PO-29
Human Remains from PO-29 were encountered in a variety of locations, but were removed
largely from two burial areas. An examination of these skeletal materials was designed to elicit
cultural aspects of their life and treatment after death, as well as biological responses to their
environment. While preservation precluded an extensive biometric evaluation of the remains, age,
sex and quality of life data were drawn for the assemblages and contrasted by burial area. The
most comprehensive data available were recovered from the oral environments. Several
individuals exhibited intentional cranial deformation which may be related to social differentiation
within these communities.

made to test these hypotheses. This study presents data from a technological analysis of
obsidian from the Olmec site of San Lorenzo. The findings of this research do not support a
political economy model for obsidian acquisition or use. The data suggest that obsidian
procurement and tool production at San Lorenzo were major components of the domestic
economy.

understand the role of ordinary households in the rapid growth of Xaltocan’s political economy. By
emphasizing the importance of the household as a unit of analysis, I argue that we can tease
apart variation in commoner economic strategies and trace their relationship to developing market
economies such as in the Postclassic Valley of Mexico.

[130] Barnacle Consumption in the Portuguese Neolithic
Although barnacles are a delicacy in some parts of the world, they are seldom recognized as a

prehistoric faunal assemblages. Using an example from the site of Rocha das Gaivotas, Portugal,
this poster explores the potential usefulness of barnacle remains in answering larger questions
about the context of social and economic change during the Neolithic in southwestern Europe.

[85] Dynamics and interaction of geological and archaeological processes in the Southern coast
of Santa Catarina, Brazil
Joint archaeological and geological investigations about the sambaquis (shellmounds) culture (8-

anthropic events as regards site formation processes. Diverse and sometimes very complex
depositional sequences have been carefully scrutinized from integrated sedimentological,
taphonomical and human agency perspectives. This methodological marriage between geo and
archaeological approaches has been fruitful in dealing with the interpretation of recurrent and
incremental mound building activities and their occupational contexts into dynamic and changing
coastal environments.

One consistent theme in Robert Sharer’s work has been exploration of the nature and impact of

Regional Archaeological Project investigated the sites of the valley and river corridor that runs
from the full highlands north of Coban and Salama to the Peten lowland frontier port city of
Cancuen. By finally closing the highland/lowland gap, we are able to specify shifting mechanisms
and patterns of affiliation, the opening and closing of barriers of resistance or influence, and the
fossilization of interregional interaction in the internal structure of frontier centers.

This project analyzed samples of deer remains at three Fort Ancient habitation sites in Dayton,
Ohio that date to consecutive periods in the late A.D. 1200s and A.D. 1300s. The goal of the
study was to assess whether the assemblages exhibited differing indicators of stress that could
be associated with environmental degradation of the region (more apparent in A.D. 1300s).
Functional and seasonal differences were explored using utility indices, aging profiles, and
element representation. Results show an increase in the number of juvenile deer represented and
an increase in low utility elements over time coincident with deteriorating environmental
conditions.

[175] Shaping the Past: Interpreting Landscape Management in the Gulf Islands of British
Columbia, Canada
The application of geoarchaeological methods to the study of human landscape modification has
been an area of growing interest, particularly with respect to prehistoric agricultural practices.
However, less attention has been given to long-term hunter-gatherer landscape management.
This is specifically the case with long-term land use on the pre-contact Pacific Northwest Coast.
By combining geoarchaeology and palynology, natural and anthropogenic influences on the local
environment can be gleaned. Sediment cores recovered from the Shingle Point site on Valdes
Island in southern British Columbia provide data that sheds light on the extent to which prehistoric
peoples engaged and shaped their local landscapes.

In Baja California, one of the dramatic challenges to models of marginality and isolation is the
presence of village sites with abundant house features on Isla Cedros. These sites provide a
stark contrast to models which infer that the Peninsula was occupied solely by mobile bands of
desert foragers. Evidence for interaction both between island communities and with the mainland

Recent research in the Acacus Mts. (SW Libya, central Sahara) yielded new information on Early

strategically organized at two different levels: extensive surveys in diverse geomorphological
units and selected excavations in both open air sites and rockshelters/caves. The combination of
the two field strategies reveals to be rather satisfying, providing interesting insights on social

Researchers have remarked on the expedience of Australian lithic technology, suggesting
artifacts were manufactured when needed and quickly discarded. Investigations of over 150,000
artifacts, however, indicate that cortical surface area is extensively underpresented from locally
knapped assemblages, suggesting cortical blanks were removed for use elsewhere. This finding
recasts Aboriginal stone technology as a highly organized strategy for ensuring the availability of
flaked stone whenever and wherever it was needed. This contradiction raises not only the
question of how curation and expedience are differentiated archaeologically, but also the larger
issue of how these designations inform on the organization of past life-ways.

a comprehensive analysis was conducted of all lithic artifacts from four sites associated with the
Oracle of Catequil, located on and around the mountain of Cerro Icchal near the village of San
José de Porcón in La Libertad, Peru. The oracle, in use between 400 CE and the Spanish arrival
in 1532 CE, is a sacred site of ancestor veneration and a place of pilgrimage. Through this
analysis, I am able to show the relationships between the four different sites at Cerro Icchal, as
well as show how this expedient tool assemblage fits into a general model for lithic design criteria
in complex societies.

Earthen reservoirs were important features of economic organization in the Sonoran Desert. The
addition of this technology provided a foundation for the expansion of permanent or near-

Zealanders are analyzed with regard to metrics of land production and resource allocation in this
context. The relationship between these islanders and their domesticated pigs in closed
agricultural systems sheds light into the high-costs and high-benefits of long term planning.

[113] Material Boundaries: territory and its traces in Arabia
Cultural anthropologists speak easily of 'social space' and rarely think what they mean.
Archaeologists, with typically a more restricted range of evidence, must think more carefully. In
the absence of epigraphic or documentary evidence political territory can be hard to spot. The
borders of Arabian tribes or Imamates are in one sense quite insubstantial. The present paper
tries to turn the archaeologist's problem back on the anthropologists and historians. Where does
the materiality of, say, tribal divisions lie and how should we understand it? If 'social space'
includes political territoriality, what counts as proof of its existence?

[37] Associated Records: The Cost of Curation
The cost of curating associated documentation can be prohibitive if not planned for appropriately.
Much has been said about the practices and costs of curating archaeological material remains,
but little information is available on similar strategies for reducing the costs of curating the records
accompanying these collections. The paper will discuss the costs of curating associated records
as well as provide suggestions on how to reduce these costs. Comparative costs of physical
versus digital records will also be addressed.

[18] Examining Artifacts with a Conservator's Eye: Analysis of Carved Shell Effigies
Conservation and archaeology can offer mutually beneficial means of gathering information about
artifacts. The examination of several prehistoric carved shell frog effigies from New Mexico
highlights some analytical methods and strategies conservators use to examine artifacts, and
demonstrates that conservators can often identify and preserve data from archaeological material
that might otherwise be overlooked. These objects were examined using a variety of methods
including polarized light microscopy, ultraviolet fluorescence, and microchemical testing. This
poster summarizes the background and treatment of these objects and addresses the benefits
and ethical considerations of a conservation-guided approach to artifact analysis and
preservation.

[88] The Mountains to the Valley: Utilization of Environmental Zones In and Around the Las
Vegas Valley
The narrow focus of compliance driven cultural resources investigations along the eastern edge
of the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada, has compounded narrow interpretations of prehistoric activities.
Recent investigations of sites in the River Mountains uncovered a series of sites spanning the
Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. All stages of tool production, including procurement, thermal
treatment, reduction and use, were found at surface sites and small rockshelters. Combining this
information with previous research provides data to test forager-collector models and theories
regarding ethnic group interactions and movement to and from the Colorado River.

[126] The Social Logic of Sacred Space: Medieval monasticism and urban planning
The medieval monastery served two masters. Monasteries played an important role in secular

and the control of arcane knowledge and ritual. The monastic spatial configuration expressed this

[172] Increased Recovery: Zooarchaeological Survey Strategies in South-Central Puerto Rico
During the Tibes Archaeological Survey Project in May and June of 2008, an excavation strategy
was applied in order to increase usable archaeological data while minimally impacting sites.
Strategically placed and carefully excavated column samples were taken and water-screened
using fine mesh (1/16”) screen. The strategy was initially developed to recover faunal material for
a zooarchaeological study of the region. However, the archaeological material recovered from
these column samples when integrated with material from standard shovel tests, not only provide
ample zooarchaeological data, but also augment the overall understanding of newly discovered
sites.

[18] The Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Chacoan Communities on the Southern Frontier
Full-coverage survey surrounding two great houses in west-central New Mexico provides data
used to reconstruct the spatial extent of Chaco-era communities. Excavated assemblages and
tree-ring dates at the great houses of Cox Ranch Pueblo and Cerro Pomo provide a temporal
anchor. Testing of community sites and surface collection of others provide comparable ceramic
data used to temporally order settlements via multivariate seriation. Temporal, locational, and site
size data are then used to assess the demographic scale and geographic extent of these
communities, which suggests sizable social entities were newly established within the region in
the mid-A.D. 1000s.

[74] Kis and "Tell": considering regional political hierarchy for the Bronze Age Körös
This paper explores food production and social relationships between tell and off-tell sites in the
Körös area of southeastern Hungary during the Early and Middle Bronze Age. Micro-
environmental information is combined with food productive estimates of pre-industrialized
farming techniques to reconstruct land use potential. These figures are compared with population
estimates at the tells, evaluating whether the food productive capacity in the immediate
environment was sufficient or required imported food (as tribute). Recent data from the
excavations of Tarhos Gyepesi Átkelő, an off-tell site downriver of the Békés-Várdomb tell, are
briefly discussed in light of the results.

[179] Stone Tools as Indicators of Optimal Foraging Strategies for Great Basin Paleoindians
Paleoindian subsistence in the Great Basin remains unclear owing to a lack of dietary
information. Extensive surface sites on pluvial lake shorelines and drainage systems indicate that
these areas were important but little else has been determined. Optimal foraging models based
on ethnographically documented behavior suggest that central place foragers would reside near
immediately available marsh resources while logistically obtaining large game from adjacent
uplands. Paleoindian stone tools from the Great Salt Lake Desert are found in the most remote
basin area in the West and provide a unique opportunity to examine functional priorities in a
distinct wetland setting.

Two sites in the Aucilla River basin in North Florida have yielded radiocarbon ages on artifact
levels ~1,400 years older than Clovis. Two other sites in North Florida have produced non-Clovis
projectile points similar to those at the pre-Clovis Aucilla sites. Investigation of the Wakulla
Springs Lodge site was recently undertaken to determine if it also might represent a pre-Clovis
contender. The archaeological results of this study will be discussed in light of a temporal context
that suggests a Pleniglacial to early glacial recession, Bølling timeframe. In other words, it is
clearly older than Clovis.

Archaic (Preceramic) site of Buena Vista in the Chillón Valley on Peru’s central coast. This inland
site on the valley floor revealed Kotosh-like architectural features and an associated large unique
stratified deposit of botanical remains, including cultivated and domesticated plants. Food
remains were identified through multiple techniques, including macroremain analysis, phytoliths
and starch. The use of multiple paleoethnobotanical techniques provides a unique opportunity to
examine the role of food in early ritual expression.

[83] Drought and the Preclassic-Classic transition in NE Peten and NW Belize
The Late Preclassic was a time of great environmental change in many parts of the Maya
Lowlands including the Classic Maya 'heartland' in the NE Peten and NW Belize. What is less
clear is the degree to which this change was the result of anthropogenic or natural processes. We
synthesize data collected in regional bajos and aguadas and other wetlands, together with data
derived from lacustrine studies, and settlement histories. These data suggest that anthropogenic
change in the form of forest clearance and soil erosion or climatic volatility were more likely the
larger agents of environmental change during this time, but drought or cyclical drying may well
have been a critical factor influencing the ability of different Maya communities to adapt to
changing conditions towards the end of the Preclassic.

[146] Archaeoentomology at the Top of the World: the Inglefield Land Archaeological Project
2008
Insects and flies have a remarkable capacity for colonizing new environments, and often
represent specific ecological niches. They are therefore valuable proxy indicators of past climates
and environments. While there have been several palaeoentomological studies on northern
Greenland, none have explored the human occupation of this region, using archaeoentomology.
Sediment samples analyzed from structures along with comparative off-site samples and modern
insect collecting data examine both present and past climatic and environmental conditions, as
well as the daily life of the region's occupants. The 2008 excavations included sampling Thule,
Dorset and Independence 1 cultures, providing a chronological sequence spanning 4000 years.

[13] Glaze-paint colono wares: representing continuity or innovation?
This study examines the nature of technological changes in Pueblo glaze-paint ceramics,
particularly colono wares, in the Rio Grande region after Spanish contact. Colono wares are
hybrid ceramics with attributes from Native ceramic traditions and medieval European vessel
forms. Little is known about technological changes that may have accompanied these new vessel
forms. I examine colono wares as a separate artifact class and compare them to traditional forms
that continue to be produced following Spanish settlement. The most significant question is
whether the technology of colono wares is as different as the vessel forms themselves,
constituting a new ceramic tradition.

examine the construction of identity through monumental art at Chiapa de Corzo. A close

emphasize the cosmopolitan nature of their city. But the monuments also combine visual
elements in unique ways, creating a site-specific style. This study will analyze the sculptural
corpus of Chiapa de Corzo to explore how art was used to construct a specific cultural identity.

Pottery design, clay chemical characterization, settlement patterns, and linguistic studies have
been used to understand Zuni origins and subsequent cultural developments. Ultimately, our
understanding of what it means to have become Zuni within the larger social landscape requires,
at least in part, an understanding of ZUNI glaze paint technology. On the one hand, glaze
technology was adopted throughout much of the prehispanic Pueblo world; on the other hand,
residents of the Zuni region developed unique glaze ware and matte paint ware traditions. I
situate recent research on Zuni pottery production within broader historical processes of cultural
change and continuity.

suggest that the Great Tradition of ancient South Asia can be described by focusing on the
relations between religious and secular authorities, the mechanisms of transmitting information,
the ethical foundations of political practice, the nature of territorial expansion, and ritual practices.
Avoiding any explicit ethnolinguistic correlations I point to the continuities of sociopolitical, ritual,
and ethical nature.

[91] Identifying and Differentiating Midcontinental North American Pipestone Quarries
Most midcontinental U.S. pipestones are argillites or claystones that form as paleosols and were
then transformed by low-temperature metamorphism. These paleosols often have similar major-,
minor-, and trace-element compositions but conditions during metamorphosis generate unique
mineral suites. Limestones, limestone-cemented limestones, and a lesser number of chlorites
make up the vast majority of pipestone materials. Our ongoing work with a portable infrared
mineral analyzer (PIMA) and more recently with a L*a*b* color meter has demonstrated that
these individual deposits can generally be differentiated. Such mineralogical identification is an
important first step in identifying and inventorying the midcontinental pipestone quarries available

This paper examines textual evidence regarding the entrada, the disruptive Teotihuacano

wielded symbolic as much as coercive power. By manipulating symbolic representations,
individuals transform social realities, playing integral roles in structural change. Sahlins'
structural-historicist approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the entrada and its
consequences by explaining the intentions and motivations of human agents in terms of a
conjuncture of opposed Teotihuacano and lowland cultural projects. Recognizing agency more
precisely situates individual actions within larger socio-historical contexts of interaction and
domination.

[49] Archaic Raw Material Procurement and Tool Production Strategies in the North
Many studies have demonstrated that lithic tool morphology is partly conditioned by tool
production sequences. This same technological approach can be applied to entire lithic
assemblages. An individual artifact assemblage is a sum of the tool production sequences of all
possible raw materials. Evidence from several Archaic-age sites in the north suggests that
assemblages result from the compilation of portions of several stone tool production sequences,
which, in turn, depend on how and when raw materials entered the archaeological record.

Communities develop under various conditions and some of their variation is attributed to the
biophysical landscape, the selection of integrative symbols, external factors, and daily
interactions. Recent research at the site of Las Caleras in the Cacaulapa Valley of Northwestern
Honduras suggests that a community identity based on shared activities and daily interactions
rather than integrative symbols transcends limitations presented by the biophysical landscape.
Despite environmental conditions unsuitable for potter production, pottery making was a
community-wide activity. This paper examines the location, site form, environment and activities
at Las Caleras, and discusses residents’ identity as a communal, activity-based construct.

[192] Preclassic Lowland Maya settlement and environment at Cival, Peten, Guatemala: results
of the 2008 season.
Very rarely can Preclassic Maya settlement be observed on the surface unobstructed by later
occupations. Recent survey and excavations around the ceremonial center of Cival afforded such
a rare opportunity. Landsat imagery, GPS and foot survey enabled the mapping of scores of
residential groups of various sizes within a 3km distance from the ceremonial center. The vast
majority of Cival's residential groups date to the Middle and Late Preclassic periods. These data
reveal the early development of urban settlement and land use patterns in the Preclassic period
which were later re-affirmed by the Classic period Maya.

[171] Contact Era Studies and the Southern Indians: A Historiography
Anthropologists, historians, and archaeologists have long pondered what happened to Native
societies when they first met the Western world, and they have offered various models for
understanding the dynamics that resulted from these encounters. These models have ranged
from early twentieth-century ideas on assimilation, acculturation, and degradation, through the
late-twentieth century processual models for culture change, social evolution and adaptation, to
the contemporary paradigms generated out of world systems, practice, and hybridity theory. This
paper examines the trajectory of scholarly thought on the contact era for the Southern Indians
from Swanton through the contemporary era.

[26] Oceanographic and Geomorphological Impacts to Potential Submerged Prehistoric Sites
The interpretation of submerged prehistoric archaeological sites depends upon an accurate
reconstruction of the geological landscape. Preservation of intact deposits is only possible in
areas that have been protected from erosive processes. This paper will discuss the
geoarchaeological investigation of three areas on the Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf.
Specifically, the paper will identify the physical processes that have impacted the sites since the
last glacial maximum. This information, including sediment deposition, wave energy, climate
change, and storm activity, will be used to quantitatively determine the depth at which in situ
deposits may be preserved.

[166] Things Could Only Get Worse: Aztec Weavers Under Spanish Rule
Aztec women produced wealth for their families through weaving, thus maintaining a cooperative
household with complementary male-female relations, even in polygynous marriages. European
intrusion worsened the status of women: they were sequestered and their value as productive
members of the household declined as European workshop weaving was adopted, with men at
the looms. The transformation of weaving reveals changes in the lives of native women as Aztec
culture gave way to the values of the Spanish empire, and it highlights features essential to well-
being and self-esteem: meaningful work, a public identity, economically worthwhile skills, and
mutual respect in the household.

[24] Sacrifice, Social Mobility, and Public Assembly in Postclassic Tlaxcalan Politics
Recently, scholars increasingly dissatisfied with marxist-neoevolutionary theory that prioritizes
elite domination in state building have begun to search for models that better incorporate political
strategies of the previous ignored subaltern. However, models of their behavior and participation
in the construction of egalitarian ideologies and collective states remain underdeveloped. In this
paper, we present archaeological and ethnohistoric research on Postclassic Tlaxcala that
contributes to models of non-elite participation in state building. During the Late Postclassic,
Tlaxcala coalesced as a powerful confederacy integrated through an egalitarian ideology that
emphasized service to the state, social mobility, public assemblies, redistribution, and
commercialization.

large shell mounds dating between 3,500 and 500 BP scattered across the north Australian
coastline. By focusing on long-term changes in valve size and age structure from several
shellmound and midden sites within Blue Mud Bay, compared with known environmental and

Understanding toolstone procurement costs, including acquisition and transport, directly links to

selection was predicated upon differential access and the costs of procurement.

Data suggest the Eastern Anasazi were slow to, or never did, adopt certain architectural,
artifactual and settlement changes that occurred elsewhere in the Anasazi world following the
Basketmaker III period. Instead of concluding, based on these data, that the Eastern Anasazi
were culturally backward, it might be more appropriate to conclude that they were culturally
orthodox. It is apparent that the Eastern Anasazi both knew of the changes and purposely chose
not to incorporate some of them into their culture.

From the Early Archaic through the Middle Woodland, Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern projectile
point styles (e.g., stemmed, notched, broad, and narrow forms) came into and fell out of use
periodically without any obvious technological, functional, or adaptive rationale. Many of these
region-wide style transitions appear to be coeval with abrupt cold episodes (Bond events) in the
North Atlantic and synchronous vegetation changes on land. During these episodes, male
coalitions occupying disrupted (usually more northern) environments may have been fatally
weakened, allowing rapid expansion and replacement by their competitors.

[44] Tracing a Migration: A Study of Athapaskan Side Notched Points and Evolutionary Patterns
The Athapaskan Migration represents an important event in the movement of humans and a very
interesting case study regarding cultural transmission. However, it is critical for us to have the
ability to recognize the quantitative signatures of the migration(s) in the archaeological record. In
this paper we apply the Identity in Notched Points Index (INPI) to notched projectile points from
purported Athapaskan related prehistoric sites from a large geographic area. This permits us to
formally test models of Athapaskan migration and adaptation.

[110] Nothing Is Simple: Identifying The Source of Late Classic Maya Volcanic Ash
Using new techniques of the 20th century, Anno O. Shepard identified and precisely described
fresh volcanic ash in pottery of the limestone Maya lowlands. For 80 years, her results have been
used to identify the Late Classic. Her question of source remained unanswered. Collaboration of
volcanology and archaeology is addressing the problem of source using new tools of the 21st
century. The unique qualities of the source(s) are described pectrographically and based on
major and trace elements. Clearly an air fall source, we are closer to the answer that Shepard
asked, but find complexities within the question.

[23] Late Woodland Pit Use in Southwestern Ontario: Faunal Insights into the Seasonality of
Storage and Waste Disposal at Western Basin Sites
Precontact groups in northeastern North America utilized subsurface pits for over 10,000 years.
Each pit feature was excavated at a specific time for a specific purpose. Many pits were
subsequently re-used, making the determination of pit function extremely difficult. This paper
demonstrates how faunal remains recovered from these contexts can suggest seasonality of pit
use and overall pit function at Western Basin Younge and Springwells phase sites. Faunal
assemblages recovered from six of these sites, dating between A.D. 1000 and 1400, are
examined. The seasonality of pit use is determined by the animal species recovered and their
relative ages, while taphonomic factors such as bone size and evidence of burning are used to
determine the primary, secondary, or tertiary nature of the deposits. These data provide further
insights into Western Basin methods of storage and waste disposal.

[67] Neolithic Mortuary Ritual at Grapèeva Cave (Croatia)
Recent excavations at Grapèeva Cave, a major Eastern Adriatic Neolithic site, yielded ample
evidence of ritual activity during the 5th millennium B.C. Structured deposits in the main interior
chamber contained extremely high frequencies of artifacts, richly decorated pottery, a faunal
assemblage indicating feasting, as well as scattered human remains. We argue that Grapèeva
was a mortuary ritual site, where feasting, offering to transcendental powers, and secondary
burial were taking place. The cave may have served as a place where memories were produced
and maintained at a time when group history and genealogy were gaining importance.

[149]Champoton and Regional Interaction in Prehispanic Coastal Campeche
The site of Champoton in Campeche is known primarily as a Contact- period settlement on the
basis of historic accounts. Recent investigations have revealed that the site had a much longer
occupation than had been supposed. While Preclassic Champoton appears to have been related
culturally to other communities in Campeche, during subsequent periods the region diverged
significantly from the inland sites, maintaining much closer cultural connections to the Lower
Usumacinta zone. In fact, current evidence suggests that Champoton may well have functioned
as an important trade center through which goods entered the inland sites of the Northern
Lowlands.

Archaeological survey along the Tambo-Ilo intervalley coastline suggests a long range of human
occupation stretching from the Preceramic through Spanish Colonial / Post-Colonial periods. By
comparing the local geology, ecology and temporal setting, a better understanding of site
occupation sequences is achieved. Artifacts were analyzed for variability in geologic material
versus the local lithology. The broad study was to determine the lithic source identity, distribution,
and regional cultural interactions of the inhabitants between the Tambo-Ilo drainages by
examining variations in coastal anthropogenic landscapes, raw material availability and lithic
resource procurement expressed in artifact assemblages.

[172] Soils and Geomorphology of P)-29 in the Portugues River Valley, Puerto Rico
Archaeological site PO-29 is located on a terrace sequence in the Portugues River Valley. The
initial soils investigation took place in July 2006 where 13 deep backhoe trenches were described
on several terraces. Numerous discontinuities were noted and buried surfaces were found in
most of the trenches. A more detailed investigation of the site was undertaken in November 2007.
An additional 12 profiles were described at the site. The soils at PO-29 were formed mainly on
alluvial deposits but colluvial sediments overlie many of the profiles. The alluvial sediments
ranged from very gravelly loamy sand or sand to clay loam. Soil development ranged from
minimal horizonation on the lower terrace to soils with argillic or cambic horizons on the upper
terraces. Around the wall areas, many discontinuities were described, with former surface
horizons sometimes extending to > 1.5 meters. In some instances, C horizons of relatively
unweathered sediments separated former surfaces; these sequences indicate active deposition
of sediment from colluvial and/or alluvial sources.

alternative interpretations of the dynamics operating within those periods. In particular this

developments. The field is rapidly expanding and making important contributions to our
understanding of cultural dynamics within a part of the world greatly affected by European

[141] Archaeology and the Second Commandment
In this introduction to the session, I begin by asking whether archaeology has been complicit in
the division of the world into (1) a broadly Biblical tradition within which the power of images as
mediators is theologically contested and (2) a wide array of non-Western and/or pre-modern
traditions in which it is assumed that the power of images is simply believed as a matter of
course. Finding the answer to be "yes", I proceed to argue for an expanded archaeological
iconology, one in which iconophilia and iconophobia are both viewed as universal aspects of the
human entanglement with images.

[143] Patterns of Community in the Formative Southern Andes
In the southern Andes, the Formative Period saw the emergence of new kinds of communities, or
social networks of interaction. Semi-sedentary and sedentary communities took hold in the
context of emergent economic systems and diverse subsistence strategies, ranging from
transhumant camelid pastoralism and agro-pastoralism to full-time agriculture. This paper
investigates the diversity of forms that these early communities took and the socio-economic
relationships that laid the foundations for their emergence. Early communities exhibited variable
degrees of flexibility, durability, and integration at different scales. These early community
patterns presented historic contingencies that conditioned later trajectories of socio-cultural
change.

in the rural hinterland, apparently alongside the indigenous inhabitants, as early as the seventh

[21] Early Bronze Age Pastoralism and the Inner Asian Mountain Corridor
Archaeology of Inner Asia shows Bronze Age societies in northeastern steppe regions started
keeping domestic animals only around 3300-3000 BC; over 3000 years later than in southwestern

spread as well? I propose that around 3500BC nomads living throughout a mountain “corridor”
from the Pamir to the Altai Mountains were key agents in the diffusion of domestic animals to
Inner Asia and were amongst the first socially connected and ecologically equipped populations
to prosper in the mountains and foster the emerging Middle Asian Interaction Sphere.

[145] Technological Change in Southwestern Asia: Comparing Metallurgical Production Styles
and Social Values during the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age
Early evidence for metal processing is found on the Iranian Plateau at a number of sites, some of
which (e.g., Tal-i Iblis) represent large-scale smelting industries, whereas other sites, including
Seh Gabi and Godin Tepe, contain similar crucible technology but with much smaller
concentrations of production debris. Through compositional and microstructural analyses, and the
use of a theoretical framework of technological change, this project considers the differences
among these contrasting scales of production on the Iranian Plateau, in terms of technology and
the possible social values placed on that technology. By linking technological changes to social
values of the craftspeople, we can understand the role of technology in the cultural context of
past communities.

El Complejo El Brujo ubicado en el litoral del valle de Chicama, tiene dentro de sus
descubrimientos de 18 años de investigación, tres tumbas de elite encontradas en la huaca Cao
Viejo que corresponden a diferentes Periodos de ocupación Moche. Una primera Tumba (Franco
2008) encontrada dentro de un mausoleo al interior del edificio principal, con carácteristicas
ùnicas hasta el momento, bautizada con el nombre de “Señora de Cao” (Moche I), que mantiene
una conservación extraordinaria y que ha sido caracterizada como una gobernante del estado
Moche Temprano en Chicama. Adicionalmente, dos tumbas de càmara fueron descubiertas en la
plataforma superior, indistintamente en diferentes espacios: Una tumba correspondiente a una
sacerdotiza anciana (Moche IV) (Franco et. al.1999) que reocupò una tumba anterior (Moche II-
III) de càmara funeraria policromada con representaciones de personajes de frente con armas y
sìmbolos de poder. Otra tumba de càmara (Moche IV), correspondiente a un alto dignatario, cuyo
cadáver no estuvo presente dentro del ataùd, considerando el contexto como un acto ceremonial
de desentierro ritual (Franco et. al. 2001). A partir de los descubrimientos arqueològicos de
Walter Alva en 1987 de las tumbas reales de Sipàn en huaca Rajada, el conocimiento sobre los
patrones de enterramiento mochicas de elite fueron cada vez en incremento con los
descubrimientos posteriores en la costa norte del Perù. En 1991, se descubrìò la tumba de la
Sacerdotiza de Moro por Cristopher Donnan y Luis jaime Castillo, a partir del cual, la identidad de
estos personajes importantes se comparaba con la iconografìa Moche, dando lugar a definir con
la información de campo, que muchos de los personajes enterrados en estos sitios fueron
protagonistas de ritos o ceremonias desarrollados en los templos o santuarios mas importantes
del àmbito de expansiòn Moche. La identidad de algunos personajes ha sido comparado con el
conocido tema de la iconografìa Moche “La Ceremonia del sacrificio” o la “Ceremonia de
Presentaciòn”, que ayudò en la definición del Personaje “A” (Señor de Sipàn), del personaje “B”
(El Sacerdote o Buho mìtico) y del personaje “C” (Sacerdotiza de Moro); faltando naturalmente
por muchos años la definición del personaje “D”, que acaba de ser descubierto en el Complejo El
Brujo con la ubicación de la tumba conocida como “Señora de Cao” y últimamente una tumba
descubierta en huaca Rajada por Luis Chero. Finalmente, la identidad en correspondencia con el
rango de los individuos mochicas no necesariamente està en funciòn de los niveles
arquitectònicos en el que se les encuentra, sino mas bièn, al parecer esta en funciòn de ciertos
criterios ideològicos que seguramente varìan de acuerdo a algunas diferencias marcadas dentro
de los territorios del norte y del sur.

the site contains a nearly complete record of late Quaternary aeolian and alluvial deposits
spanning the last 25,000 years. Our investigations to date indicate the possibility that the site
preserves a well stratified archaeological sequence that represents terminal Pleistocene to late
Holocene occupations.

[63] The Shala Valley Project: Using Interdisciplinary Anthropology to Study Isolation in a Remote
Albanian Village
The Shala Valley Project supports integrated programs of archaeological, ethnohistoric, and
ethnographic research in the high mountains of northern Albania. The project's primary goal was
to study the origins of the Shala tribe and its response through time to external powers. In 2005
we discovered a previously unknown fortified Iron Age site, called Grunas. Excavation results
have allowed us to begin to compare modern (15th-21st century), tribal patterns of settlement and
land use to those of the prehistoric period. It seems likely that Iron Age peoples sought refuge in
the mountains for reasons similar to those of the current residents.

[154] Change and Continuity in a Puuc Urban Center: Structures N1050E1065 and N1065E1025
from the Yaxché Group, Kiuic, Yucatán
This paper focuses on excavations of two major structures in the Yaxché group, an architectural
complex defined as a "palace" in the urban center of Kiuic, Yucatán. The archaeological materials
recovered in the different stratified contexts indicate a complex history of construction that ranges
from the Middle Formative to the Late/Terminal Classic. This history is used to examine
transformations in diverse spaces of the urban center. A comparative analysis of similar Maya
structures and groups in the Puuc region offers insights into the evolution, and meaning of both
monumental architecture and the nature of urbanism in the northern Maya lowlands.

[99] Sugar, Slaves, and STPs: Preliminary Results from Nevis
We describe preliminary results from STP surveys of the slave-village sites associated with two
sugar plantations on the island of Nevis, in the eastern Caribbean. On both plantations we
identified two villages, one dating to the 18th century and a successor settlement from the early-
19th century. STP methods reveal for the first time the internal structure of these sites and allow
us to date the occupations with accuracy. The results point to synchronous and similar settlement
shifts on both plantations, linked to changes in sugar production strategies.

[47] Cultural Landscapes of the Kumeyaay Indians in Northern Baja California
The cultural landscape of the Kumeyaay of northern Baja California includes the sacred,
symbolic, economic, and mythological views of a people who lived in the region for centuries.
Recent research incorporates ethnographic, ethnohistorical, and archaeological information that
reveals a landscape that is alive and imbued with power, sustenance, and legend. Kumeyaay
place names abound, and sacred sites, peaks, transformed rocks, magic boulders, and other
geographic features associated with oral tradition populate the landscape. Ecosystems and areas
of historic significance represent direct links with generations of ancestors and are still layered
with meaning in the minds of descendants.

[102] Evaluating Market Exchange: Using Late and Terminal Classic Maya Ceramics from the
Upper Belize River Valley
This diachronic study tests the argument that a market economy developed in the Maya Late and
Terminal Classic period (AD 600-900) in the upper Belize River Valley, Belize. Two common
ceramic groups and forms (Mount Maloney bowls and Cayo jars) from three sites (Actuncan,
Xunantunich, and San Lorenzo) are sampled to investigate changes in production and
standardization. A market economy should affect production, leading to increased specialization.
Specialization should be evidenced in increased standardization of goods. Rim sherds are
measured to evaluate changes in standardization and variability. Petrographic thin-section
analysis is used to compare paste compositions across sites and phases.

Studies on the topic of the feathered-serpent have focused on its contributions in the spread of
Mesoamerican culture – primarily during the Classic and Postclassic period. This paper takes a
different approach in that it examines the continuity and change of the feathered-serpent from the
Formative to the Classic period. Data used will include feathered-serpent imagery from various
art objects (i.e., monuments, relics, rock art) from sites in the Gulf Coast, Central Mexico, and the
Maya region. The study has both archaeological and cultural significance as it explores the
antiquity of the feathered-serpent and its role in early Mesoamerican society.

[177] Discipline and discord: the paradoxical lifeworld of soldiers in Roman armies
Soldiers in Roman armies bore much of the institutional weight of the Roman empire. The lives
that soldiers lived were heavily disciplined temporally and spatially, and from the archaeology of
the places in which they dwelt, and the equipment that they used, we can gain some sense of the
bodily transformations involved in becoming a Roman soldier. At the same time, a more
discordant side of Roman military life existed. As well as being the force that kept the empire
together, soldiers embodied many of its tensions, being at the heart of struggles over what it
meant to be Roman.

The isolation of the Lower Eastern Shore Directly affected the economic growth and development
of Salisbury, Maryland. For almost two centuries the town of Whitehaven was the main focal point
for merchants on the Wicomico River, but at some point that all changed and the merchants
moved upriver to Salisbury. As a result Salisbury, not Annapolis, has been the second largest
port in Maryland. Watercraft of all sorts played a main role in the Eastern Shore's economy until
the introduction of trains and the construction of the Bay Bridge. These investigations will draw on
the results of a survey that was conducted last year on the Wicomico River, where nine
shipwrecks were found.

Recent scholarship defines “technology” as “the processes and practices associated with
production and consumption, from design to discard” (Miller 2007). In this paper, I will approach
burial landscapes as a technology and use the chaîne opératoire to study the site of Sutton Hoo
in the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of East Anglia. I will also draw on evidence from defensive structures
to compare construction methods. In doing so, I illustrate the conceptualization component of
these burial mounds, and how that informs our interpretations of Anglo-Saxon society, and
address the potentials and limitations for studying landscape as a form of technology.

[113] Cosmological Ideals and Physical Realities in Maya Territorial Organization
The ancient Maya conceived of the universe as having three tiers including the heavens, earth,
and underworld. Every effort was made to reconstruct this cosmological model during the building
of ceremonial centers and the establishment of political territories. Even though this cosmological
ideal was rarely achieved in a physical sense, the Maya would still reference the ideal when
speaking of their territory in written texts. Archaeological investigations show us that the physical
realities of Maya territorial organization were directly related to other factors such as the location
of natural resources, natural topography, and proximity to other major centers.

In their interpretation of the ritual space, archaeologists have tended to focus on imposing sacred
landmarks at the expense of less visible but nonetheless important features such as altars,
niches, and guardians. This interaction of animate, sacred features is articulated at the cave
complex of Quen Santo wherein the creation of sacred space mirrors the cosmological
organization of the ancient Maya. Ethnographic data among the Chuj and other Maya groups
indicate cosmological connections that are represented and performed through rituals and
physical objects in this sacred realm where humans and nature converge all, past, present and
future spaces.

The Brazilian coast was intensively occupied by fisher-gatherers and sambaqui type sites abound
in coastal regions characterized by the presence of rivers and lagoons. These sites have diverse

archaeologists find monumental sites that can have over 30 m in height. Built between 6000 and
1500 BP, they are composed by shell and bones of aquatic animals. Human burials are present
in all sites, and in some cases their construction is related with the repetition of rituals involving
funerary feasting.

clays", to the ubiquitous (in some areas) FCR often contain clues to local diets. Newer methods
of identifying organic residues through the use of FTIR (infra-red) add considerably to our
understanding of diet and, combined with more traditional analyses, contributes to our ability to

artifacts are consistent with a Late Woodland occupation, some lithics are suggestive of a
Hopewell horizon.

[78] From the Interior to the River: Africans, Europeans, and Creoles on The Gambia River
During the Atlantic Trade
The Gambia River was connected to many of the major trade systems in West Africa, with direct
ties to the Saharan and Atlantic networks. Prior to the arrival of the Portuguese, Mande traders
traveled from the inland Niger delta to the coast trading gold and other commodities for salt. In
the mind-15th century, Portuguese merchants initiated commerce along the river, ultimately
reorienting trade patterns in the Senegambia from interior land-based to Atlantic maritime. This
paper presents findings from archaeological and historical investigations at the Niumi trade center
of Juffure as well as peripheral villages of San Domingo and Lamin. The overall focus of these
investigations is to examine potential changes in daily life due to shifts in interactions and
commerce from the 15th to the 19th century.

The landscape provides a visible backdrop for pre-historic activities – where early people were
moving about in the course of daily living. The evidence of their presence is left in habitation sites,
camping spots, lithic scatters, quarries, and on marked boulders that may confirm ritual activities.
With trails as connective tissue, can a relationship be determined that might identify who marked
the boulders? Landscape theory provides a conceptual framework to ‘unpack’ the evidence of
human pasts on the landscape. The PCN (Pecked Curvilinear Nucleated) tradition occurring in
the Coastal Ranges of California provides a case study for applying landscape theory.

the Ferndale Site was occupied for a period of about 1,000 years. The Ferndale structures exhibit

Movement of contaminated soils (from historic mining) in arid climates is often regarded as being
negligible and not a threat to the wider environment. However, storm events in Southern Nevada
involve short time period high volume precipitation, resulting in flash floods. Understanding the
delivery mechanism for metals (i.e. As, Hg) and other contaminants (CN-) is important because
the movement of soils during summer monsoons is significant. Results from 3 wash systems
indicate elevated metals and CN- throughout, with HG and CN- 30-95 times greater than
background. Downstream soil characteristics may highlight the locality of unknown pollution
sources (abandoned mines).

previous rituals that had been redeposited in preparation for the next use. Such behaviors have
been described ethnographically as part of modern Maya ritual.

The classic great houses at Salmon and Aztec were established as late 11th-century Chacoan

Middle San Juan communities saw increased aggregation and large villages with more typical
San Juan architecture. We compare the Pueblo III component at Aztec and contemporaneous
settlements throughout the Middle San Juan to contextualize Post-Chacoan developments and

Why did Clovis people cache artifacts? What can caches tell us about early Paleoindian
behavior? To address these questions, we have undertaken an analysis of the Fenn Clovis
Cache, 56 lithic tools from an unspecified locality in the Utah-Wyoming-Idaho tri-state area. We
present new data on the (1) character and origin of tool-stones used to produce the artifacts
(using geochemical techniques), (2) potential functions of the artifacts (using high-power and low-
power microscopic approaches), and (3) technological and morphometric aspects of bifacial
points and bifaces. With these results, we explore aspects of Clovis technological and settlement
organization, as well as ritual/symbolism.

[107] Strategizing Social Identity in Historic Bundu
Oral traditions and technological systems index social identities in very different ways, yet a
shared potential for malleability gives them both strategic importance in the politics of identity. A
comparative approach to these complementary strands of evidence may therefore reveal how
people played upon words and material objects in their representations of identity. This paper
develops such an approach to explore strategies of social identification in the ethnolinguistically
diverse region of Bundu, a 17th-19th century Islamic polity located in the eastern Senegambia.

[169] Just How Strong? Examining the Notion of Classic Maya States
Robert Sharer was a relatively early proponent of the conjunctive approach to Maya studies,
bridging history and archaeology to understand the micro- and macro-historical patterns of
statecraft in the Maya area. One result of the conjunctive approach is the ongoing discussion of
just how tightly integrated Maya states were politically, socially, and economically. This paper
builds on work by Sharer and others in the eastern Maya area, as well research by the author and
others in the Western Maya lowlands to provide an analysis of the integrating economic, cultural,
and political structures of Classic period Maya kingdoms outside the Central Peten region.

[170] Late Intermediate Period Fuel Use in Sicán Production Contexts: Implications for
Sustainable Use of Dry Tropical Forest Resources
A considerable focus of the past thirty years of the Sicán Archaeological Project in the La Leche
Valley of Northern Peru was the reconstruction of craft production and political economy in the
region. In 1999 and 2001 the excavation of an artifact workshop, dedicated to producing ceramic
and metalwork and associated with three domestic areas, permits a unique insight into the use of
fuel resources and the potential impact of political economy on the regional environment. As the
principal fuels used for both forms of production come from trees, and given that the local
environment is best classed as a Dry Tropical Forest, the potential for overuse of arboreal
resources was unprecedented. The investigation of fuel use at the site indicates that several
variables, fuel reuse, garbage recycling as fuel, pastoralism, and seasonality all played significant
roles in mitigating the potential for fuel overexploitation. The potential for this model of production
to demonstrate a way forward for modern sustainable use and management of Dry Tropical
Forest resources will be explored in this presentation. Of critical importance is to demonstrate that
holistic models of ancient production and social organization can facilitate future directions in
modern sustainable resource use, placing archaeology in the service of modern dialogues on
sustainable resource use.

[108] Segmentary social organization and Andean State Expansion: Multiethnicity and Diasporic
Migration in Tiwanaku (AD 600-1000)
The development of the Tiwanaku state (AD 600-1000) is often interpreted according to a
monolithic centralized state model derived from old world archaic and modern imperial
precedents. New settlement pattern, household, and mortuary archaeology, and ethnographic
parallels suggest a reappraisal of the socio-political organization of Tiwanaku. Diverse corporate
social entities may be identified both within the altiplano core region and in Tiwanaku’s lowland
agropastoral colonies in the south central Andes. The enduring sociopolitical pluralism within the
Tiwanaku homeland and colonies tempers some of our globalist assumptions about the
predominant role of centralized institutions in archaic states.

contexts have demonstrated they did not subscribe exclusively to Wari traditions. Preliminary
investigations indicate they incorporated certain Wari tenets into an existing ideological system
native to the region; although this population may have labored in conjunction with the Wari state,
the ideological divide demonstrates a degree of autonomy exercised by inhabitants of the
Chuquibamba Valley.

[68] Understanding Classic Era Cultural and Landscape Change of Northwestern Belize:
Methodological Concerns of Comparing Sites and Communities
This project examines Classic Maya political and cultural relations between a subsidiary
community, Ixno’ha, and a regional center, La Milpa. Previous research suggests that the political
orientation shifted from one of dispersed communities; to a region dominated by La Milpa; to one
of decentralization and heterogeneity of site planning, settlement, and landscape. I am assessing
this reconstruction by comparing community landscapes defined by settlement patterns and
sociocultural ties. However, differences in community sizes, excavation volumes, and evolving
mapping techniques has meant the need to standardize ceramic data, develop common
architectural categories, and simplify otherwise complex GIS constructed maps.

[19] Constructive Systems and Architectural Elements Identified Inside the PAX Study Area and
its Surroundings. A Stylistic Comparison
Based on work done by the Xuenkal Archaeological Project (PAX), we can identify different
architectural characteristics and systems that differ across the site as well as similarities across
the occupied sequence, which lasts from the Late Preclassic to the Late Classic. There are two
clear architectural forms in the site associated with a particular style and chronology: Puuc
structures associated with Cehpech sphere ceramics from the Late Classic, and Sotuta platforms
from the Terminal Classic. Similarly architecture surveyed between Xuenkal and Dzadz Naranja
shows even more different types of architecture, for example megalithic architecture from the
Early Classic; Cehpeh and Sotuta architecture associated with Late and Terminal Classic, and
also Postclassic structures. This work complements and enriches understandings of the context
of the northeast Yucatan peninsula’s regional differences in architecture and how it relates to
over-reaching political differences.

The Identity in Notched Points Index (INPI) highlights the major morphological differences
between notched points. The INPI, used in conjunction with pattern recognition clustering
techniques has provided interesting results suggesting it may be possible to acknowledge small
groups to single artisans. We believe this to be especially feasible when cultural transmission
favors neutral behaviors. Utilizing a sample of notched points recovered from Neolithic sites in the
Near East, we suggest that this technique can aid in a greater understanding of variation between
material goods as well as the role of human behavior interacting with stone technologies.

In recent decades, many archaeologists and archaeometrists have moved away from studies of

Results indicate similar species were consumed by both elites and non-elites, though significant
variation in the type and range of faunal elements recovered from different contexts reflect clear
socioeconomic distinctions at the site. This variation has implications for intra-site economic
patterns and may reflect redistributive behavior by elite heads of households to their dependants
and kin.

[66] Spatial Patterns of Archaeofauna Procurement at Pueblo Bonito Chaco Canyon, New
Mexico: Evidence from geographic (87Sr/86Sr ratios) and topographic (δ18O) sourcing techniques.
This paper asks if resource depression is evident at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, by using
tandem geographic archaeofaunal sourcing via 87Sr/86Sr ratios and δ 18O values to evaluate
the presence of distant patch procurement during peak population within Chaco Canyon.
Evolutionary ecological modeling and previous sourcing studies lead to the hypothesis that the
archaeofauna should show evidence of non-local procurement consistent within decreased local
availability. Sourcing results indicate non-local procurement for several faunal categories. The
results from this paper suggest the degree of resource depression within Chaco Canyon was
significant, forcing high energetic investment in non-local resource procurement.

[99] The Emergence of the Maya Tlaloc: A Late Classic Religious Icon
This research project focuses on the iconographic representations of the Central Mexican god
Tlaloc in the Maya region. It was during the Early Classic Period that Tlaloc transcended the
boundaries of Central Mexico and was adopted into Maya ideology. During the Late Classic
Period, a "Maya Tlaloc" was established and used to express ideologies depicting warfare and
ritual activity. The adoption of Tlaloc imagery among the ancient Maya ultimately holds significant
value to understanding Maya ideology and religion as well as facilitates an understanding of wide-
scale interactions with Central Mexico.

[149] Regional Perspectives on the Olmec revisited
"Regional Perspectives on the Olmec", edited by Robert Sharer and me, was published exactly

Mesoamerican Formative period? This presentation comments upon the problems and debates
within Olmec archaeology in 1989 that led to the book and then assesses our state of knowledge
today. While the regional perspective approach has become widely adopted, old ideas and
debates still linger. More significantly, we still lack a comprehensive view of the Formative period
because too many regions of Mesoamerica remain poorly known.

[25] A walk in the dust: reconstructing prehistoric mobility patterns from archaeological site
distributions
This paper draws an analogy between the modeling of particle movement by physicists and the
reconstruction of human mobility by archaeologists. In the former case, movement is often
simulated via random walks, the vertices of which can be eliminated so that one is left with a
‘dust’ of nodes. In the latter case, a dust of sites in the landscape is often very apparent; our task
is the restoration of the vertices that once connected them. Using a novel simulation methodology
parameterized with ethnographic data, this paper estimates specific movement patterns based on
a number of archaeological site distributions.

Funerary use of caves in extremely inaccessible high cliffs is a typical pattern of the ancient
Chachapoyas people (AD 800 into early Colonial times) in the cloud forest of northeastern Peru.
There is a very little evidence for earlier periods. Underground caves have been receiving greater
attention from different groups of speleologists in the last decade. Archaeologists from Centro

[154] Reassessing Puuc State Development in a Deep Chronological Context
Explanations of the Puuc florescence have traditionally invoked migration and secondary state
formation as key processes. These models often assume a short span of Puuc occupation that is
confined to the Terminal Classic period (800-1000 AD). Excavations by the Bolonchén Regional
Archaeological Project make this chronological assumption problematic since they demonstrate a
continuous ceramic sequence, divided into six complexes, that begins in the Middle Preclassic
period (ca. 800 BC). This paper compares the similarities and differences in the Bolonchén
ceramic complexes to other contemporaneous ceramics in the Maya lowlands to critically
examine these long-standing models of Puuc state formation.

[30] Late Archaic Totora Processing in the Titicaca Basin: Evidence for Early Craft Specialization
Excavations at Jiskairumoko, an Archaic period site in the southwestern Lake Titicaca basin,
Peru, discovered approximately 50 denticulate stone tools unique to the Rio Ilave drainage.
Found in domestic contexts, these tools offer the possibility of revealing new insights about
household economy during the sedentarization process. Employing starch grain, use-wear, and
experimental performance analyses, we tested the hypothesis that the tools functioned as rasps
to process totora (Schoenoplectus californicus), a "bulrush" still used for consumption and textile
production throughout the region. Results support the interpretation that the early village's
domestic economy included totora textile production using denticulate rasps.

As an example of affluent foraging economies, the Jomon data from the Japanese islands show
ample evidence of subsistence intensification. In particular, scholars have pointed out the
importance of nut collecting in Jomon economy. Scholars have also suggested that the cooling
climate at around 4000 BP resulted in the decline of chestnut harvests and a shift in staple food
from chestnuts to buckeyes. Rather than to assume the climate change to have been the
dominant cause of long-term culture change, this paper examines the impact of multiple human
activities on the Middle Jomon cultural landscape.

We report on investigations at the Late Classic (CE 600-900) Maya rural houselot and ancestor
shrine of Guijarral, where ceramic, phosphate, and pH assessments were obtained from a grid of
some 180 shovel test pits. Results indicate overlap of organic and inorganic trash in some areas
with discrete disposal patterns in others. These deposits demonstrate cultural preferences for
resource use and disposal among Late Classic Maya bajo dwellers in the Northeastern Yucatan.

Maya curated and cached figural objects are frequently considered as non-human agents whose

These capacities are linked with their mimetic properties in addition to their archaeological
recovery in caches and burials. In drawing on recent materiality studies, this paper expands on
the active role of curated or cached objects to consider other types of ancient Maya figural
images, many of which were found in middens. In particular, attention is given to processes of
animation through sensory cues (e.g. music, scent, color) and objectification processes between
humans and the material world.

[168] Palaeo-Eskimo Lithic Exploitation Strategies: Assessing Inferences of Culture Change
Through Chert Sourcing on Southern Baffin Island
Differential selection of lithic raw materials is thought to represent a marker of cultural change
within the eastern Arctic Palaeo-Eskimo cultural continuum. However, few studies have used
geochemical methods to evaluate this inference. On southern Baffin Island chert toolstone is
highly variable thus presenting a complicated sourcing problem. In this paper, we present a
combined methodological approach to source this chert and to evaluate if toolstone selection
strategies changed over time. Our results indicate there are at least four distinct sources of chert
in the interior of the island and that the Palaeo-Eskimo exploitation of them remained consistent
for 2400-years.

[44] Viewing cultural transmission as a diffusion process: Models, tests and implications
The transmission of any information, either cultural or genetic, is inherently a stochastic process.
Cultural transmission can be modeled by coupling a deterministic social learning rule with a
stochastic error term, reflecting inherent copying errors during transmission events. Using simple
mathematical models, we first explore long-term predictions of accumulated copying errors on
archaeological variation through time. Second, we develop statistics that allow us to examine
both the evolutionary mechanisms in observed rates of change in archaeological data through
time, and the strength of learning biases involved. Third, we then test these predictions using
Clovis projectile point data, and discuss the overall implications.

support for explicit predictions regarding the interaction between relatedness and inequality

Archaeologists’ interest in materiality aligns well with ongoing discussion between Indigenous and

Chesapeake region, we recognize that the immaterial, and low materiality, are critical aspects of
powerful Native places. Integrating Indigenous conceptions of materiality (past and present),
critical reading of ethnohistory and archaeological analysis, this paper examines two ‘king’s
howses’: the home of Chief Powhatan and the Monacan town of Monasukapanough. Such places
embody a deep history of community construction and social negotiation whose significance
overshadows the densities of objects present on the ground.

[48] Ritually Charged Rubbish?: Characterizing Terminal Deposits Associated with Site
Abandonment in Maya Archaeology
Material studies of Maya ritual practice in ethnoarchaeology suggest that objects entering
archaeological contexts demarcate more than “sacred” and “profane;” the type of materials, the
deposit style, and its location are socially meaningful choices. The ritual significance of material
discard in the context of site abandonment is widely debated in Maya archaeology. Interpretations
range from ceremonial feasting to ritual desecration, often resulting from warfare. An analysis of
the content, composition, and context of terminal deposits, compared with ethnoarchaeological
studies, explores the ways that individuals use material culture to inscribe social meaning to ritual
practices and places in the built environment.

The archetypical pre-European incursion complex societies of the Northeast are northern

archaeologists for over a century. These speculations have focused on a small series of traits
including pottery technology and decoration, maize-based agriculture, and longhouses. Recent
empirical evidence has led to a dissociation of the histories of these traits and, therefore
traditional ideas about northern Iroquoian evolution. These new histories coupled with new
theoretical insights, informs our perceptions of complexity and its realization in the late prehistory

[116] The Ebb and Flow of Change in Native New England during the 16th-17th Centuries
Native American communities in early colonial New England experienced great change, social
upheaval, displacement, and violence. However, archaeological interpretations have
overemphasized transformations in technologies, settlements, economies, and social
organization. Continuities in these dimensions of early colonial Native life have been masked by
historical erasures and minimized in interpretations of the archaeological record. These factors
make early colonial period sites and their pre-contact antecedents important datum points for
understanding the nature of social complexity in Native societies during the 16th-17th centuries.
Here, we examine two such sites in Deerfield, Massachusetts, as a mean to discuss the complex
transformations in Native lifeways.

four seasons of fieldwork by the Proyecto Ynalche are summarized, with an emphasis on
changes in political economy and social organization following the conquest of the Sicán by the
Chimú and Inka empires. Water management became increasingly centralized under imperial
rule, accompanied by the dissolution of longstanding Sicán settlements and the transformation of
local architecture and craft economies.

[53] Composition Studies and Optical Petrography Use for Tracking Changes in Ceramic
Technology at Sylvester Manor
Changes in style of locally-produced shell-tempered ceramics at the Shelter Island, New York site
of Sylvester Manor were explored through composition studies and optical petrography. The aim
was to assess potential contributions by enslaved Africans to traditional Native American ceramic
practices. The results suggest changes based in the practice of mortar production and closer
control of firing temperatures, skills closely associated with the enslaved Africans at the site.

[145] Paintings and petroglyphs in the Bumbusi ridge rockshelters, northwestern Zimbabwe
Zimbabwe's thousands of rock-art sites contain almost exclusively polychrome paintings. A very
few sites are known with animal-spoor petroglyphs; most are in Hwange National Park. During
excavations at the sites in 2008, numerous painted shapes and animal outlines were also
discovered alongside the carvings. Also, some spoor carvings had been painted in shades
ranging from dark red to a very light grey-blue. This presentation describes and illustrates
examples of the art, identifies the proportions of different animal species represented by
hoofprints, offers a few interpretations, summarizes results of the excavations, and provides
descriptive statistics for the sites.

[112] Red Earth, White Clouds: The Metaphorical World of Kayenta Pottery
Why did Kayenta potters of northern Arizona make whiteware jars and redware bowls in the 12th
and 13th centuries? We propose that potters mastered two contrasting technologies as an
expression of alternating complementary dualities that structured the Pueblo world then and now.
In Kayenta times, pottery vessels served as metaphorical bodies that were appropriately "clothed"
with painted designs to reiterate contrasts between earth and sky/clouds, corn and cotton, and
women’s and men’s ritual responsibilities. So clothed, pots might have become metaphorical
persons.

[109] Rock Art and Modern Caribbean Cultural Identity
The not-uncommonly heard words "nuestros indios" (our Indians) belie not only modern
Caribbean society's proprietary interest in prehistoric cultures, but also reflect a key element in
the ethic identity of Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic. At issue is how these current
societies form their identities vis-a-vis themselves and outside groups. Spanish, African,
Amerindian and North American cultural backgrounds are available for the formation process. A
study of the area's prehistoric rock art and present artisan traditions is one means to view this
process whereby the native past is incorporated into their cultural identities. In effect, the native
past symbolic images carved into stone "crossover" a time boundary and become part of the
symbols of the new island societies.

[102] Flake Core Technology during the Late Classic Period (AD 600-800) at the Ancient Maya
Site of Chan, Western Belize
Chan was an ancient Maya farming community where flake core technology primarily consisted of
chert cores with a single-platform and flakes removed in a single direction. During the Late
Classic, this flake core configuration predominated regardless of stone quality or household
wealth. These are variables which have been argued elsewhere to be determinates of core
configuration and reduction strategies. Alternative explanations are necessary to account for the
similarity in observed cores. Ongoing debitage analysis is consistent with preformed flake cores
being imported from outside the household. Likely, the form of imported cores determined
ensuing flake core reduction at Chan.

[140] Colonial Expansion on the Chesapeake Frontier: A Reassessment of Newman’s Neck
Plantation
Newman’s Neck, a small plantation on Virginia’s Northern Neck, was occupied from the 1650s to

waterways. Indentured, enslaved, and free labor combined in an agricultural economy to create a
multi-ethnic community and transform the frontier. This paper considers the material evidence of
this transition through architecture, landscape, and portable material culture. It also demonstrates
the utility of reassessing collections from salvage sites in light of new frontier models.

South American archaeology provides many critical world examples of human adaptations to

orientations in the economies of settled populations in Amazonia. It considers how fishing
provides an important staple and how the wetland modification and management were critical to
the development and organization of complex societies in the region. Features of these societies
and aquatic adaptations in Amazonia are compared to other areas of South America, such as
early complex societies of coastal Peru.

Excavation of an early Mesilla phase (circa A.D. 600 to A.D. 900) site resulted in the collection of
thousands of sherds from a residential habitation located on an alluvial fan emanating from the
eastern flakes of Organ Mountains in southern New Mexico. This collection allowed a detailed
examination of the ceramic container technology of forager-farmers during this period in southern
New Mexico. Our preliminary findings concerning vessel manufacture and function are compared
to previous studies at sites in the Tularosa valley, along with a cross-cultural comparison with
proto-historic and historic forager-farmer groups. The results shed light on the transition from
multi-use vessels to an increasingly specialized ceramic container technology.

[180] Exotic Commodities, Social Complexity, and Community Organization: Evidence Supporting
a Prehistoric Hierarchical Arrangement among Northern Sinagua Sites near Flagstaff, Arizona
The development of social complexity often involves restricted access to materials, resources,
and social position. To address the problem of Northern Sinagua social complexity, I test for
differential access to material goods by analyzing the quantity and distribution of exotic
commodities (shell, copper, macaws, pigments, and turquoise) recovered from 14 Northern
Sinagua sites dating between A.D. 1065 and 1250. The spatial distribution evidences a
predominantly restricted flow of exotic commodities concentrated among primary sites (containing
open air ball courts, plazas, or terraces). Accordingly, I interpret these sites as social or
ceremonial centers, accommodating community, and perhaps regionally, integrative activities.

[43] A Multidisciplinary Approach for the Determination of Cultural Affinity: Incorporating
Contextual, Osteological, and Historical Documentation
Historically, typological classification has been a key strategy to identify group affiliation from the
archaeological record, but this method does not consider how a group defines itself nor the
admixture of multiple groups. Assessing affinity is often difficult since no simple correspondence
exists between one’s biological ancestry and one’s culture. This is especially true in the context of
19th century Tucson, where the majority of the population shared a Hispanic culture and diverse
Native American and Euroamerican roots. This paper presents a multidisciplinary approach to
assess cultural affinity, with emphasis on multiple lines of historical, contextual, and osteological
evidence.

[18] Characterizing Hispanic Ceramics in Historic New Mexico: Formation Methods and Firing
Techniques
The relationship of Hispanic ceramics to emerging Hispano-American identity in 18th and 19th
century New Mexico is poorly understood. Ethnic fluidity suggests that decorative style is not a
useful indicator of identity in historic New Mexico. This preliminary study used x-ray imaging and
refiring analysis to examine non-visible differences in “Hispanic” and “Pueblo” technological
styles. Neither analysis suggested variation indicative of distinct identities. This ambiguity may be
due to small sample size. Further study with larger samples and better cultural context may clarify
technological and cultural decisions behind Hispanic pottery and help delineate the ethnic
environment of this period.

[1] Crossing Spatial-Temporal Scales, Expanding Social Theory
Archaeology works at multiple spatial (household to site to region) and temporal (generational to
epochal) scales. This multi-scalar work provides theoretical insights about the relationships
between scale and social or evolutionary processes, including the roles of human agency,
intentionality, and perception. While humans perceive and intentionally act at fairly small scales,
their agency and the effects of their actions have reverberations at much larger scales. This
crossing of scales has implications for myriad theoretical approaches, ranging from the Resilience
framework to Annales cycles. These implications are explored by drawing from a multi-case
comparison from the US Southwest.

Migration is a phenomenon of perennial concern to archaeologists in general, and for those
working in Eurasia in particular. Recent noteworthy contributions to the investigation of prehistoric
migrations in Eurasia echo well-worn assertions that shifts in the geographic distribution of certain
persistent and enduring material types reflect cohesive linguistic and cultural groups and their
movements. However, new investigations into production patterns associated with another
persistent and enduring material type known as Kura-Araxes ware present evidence both for
emulation and migration and pose challenges to existing models of migration while complicating
the way identity, frontiers and migration are considered.

Post-A.D. 1550 Fort Ancient components have been documented at several rockshelters in the

very large ceramic jars and shell gorgets from some of these sites suggests an alternative

one to five years. The fissioning of large villages may have lead to the relocation of households to
these dispersed settlements.

It will also provide some interpretations regarding aspects of daily life during the Formative period

This paper focuses on the significance of grave goods associated with a Napatan warrior burial

burial both in terms of what it signifies about the individual’s status and the accessibility of this
relatively exotic material. However, what is also striking about it is the concurrence of more
traditional, seemingly mundane lithic items along side these exotic ones. This contrast provides a
basis from which archaeological inferences can be made regarding the relative importance of the
individual objects and the social meaning they carried.

of the polity governed by a king (tlatoani). The terminology used for the governors and the

Residential mobility, whether seasonal or habitual, is a major determinate of the archaeological

two sources; Ancestral Pueblo peoples who resided in permanent communities located to the
north and west and by more mobile groups.

[177] The abject warrior: Defeated bodies of Moche and beyond
Bodies of defeated warriors become sites in which themes of abjection, subjugation, and

depiction of defeated bodies as impotent, homogenous, or dismembered. These images use the
body as an explicit metaphor for the defeat of a rival polity, symbolizing, through heads, hair, and
genitalia, the abject status of the rival. I explore how the Moche of Peru employed this imagery to
create a powerful narrative in which neighboring polities experienced defeat through the bodies of
their captive combatants. Examples of similar iconography from other complex societies
demonstrate that this is a common strategy across time and space.

Chemical compositional analysis of native copper is used to explore the nature and extent of
archaic communities and inter-community exchange networks, and the role these networks
played in mediating social interaction during the Late Archaic (ca. 3600 to 2000 BP). Copper from
multiple sites in the western Great Lakes was analyzed using Laser-Ablation – Inductively
Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICPMS). The results provide the opportunity to examine
differing sources areas used by, and exchange between, contemporary populations of the Burnt
Rollways phase, the late Middle Archaic Reigh site, and terminal archaic (Red Ocher) Riverside
site.

[190] An Excavated Clovis Cache from Central Iowa
Within the Clovis archaeological record there exists about a dozen known “isolated” artifact
assemblages composed variably of bifacial cores and preforms, finished points, unifacial tools,
and occasionally, bone and ivory rods. The Carlisle cache from Warren County, Iowa is a
previously unrecognized utilitarian cache of 37 Clovis artifacts. It was documented and recovered
in situ on a gently-rolling, terminal Wisconsin outwash terrace that drained the Des Moines Lobe
of the Laurentide ice sheet. The cache offers new insights on Clovis technological organization,
including cache construction, and patterns of land use and mobility.

Yucatán
The Terminal Classic witnessed social and economic reorganization related to the changing
political systems of the Maya lowlands. This paper examines material culture variability in the
Bolonchén district of the Puuc region, where in some cases site abandonment appears to have
been a gradual process at the end of the Terminal Classic period. Special consideration will be
given to data resulting from recent excavations within the urban core of the site of Huntichmul,
where architectural evidence suggests a post-monumental occupation following the cessation of

[29] Long-term Trends in Diet Breadth: Changes in prehistoric hunting on the Great Plains
This study involves the analysis of published information on human use of animals at more than
100 archaeological sites from across the Great Plains to better understand the nature human-
animal interactions over the last 13,000 years. Specifically, this project hopes to explore the
nature of prehistoric subsistence by tracking which animals Plains groups hunted and how
hunting decisions changed depending on (1) regional differences in availability of key prey
species, such as bison, (2) the introduction of new hunting technologies (bow-and arrow) or
techniques (cliff jumps and corral kills), (3) the development of corn farming and (4) human
overhunting that would have changed the population structure of prey communities.

[77] Quantifying Postdepostional Translocation of Archaeological Materials: An Update on a
Long-term Experiment
Archaeologists frequently acknowledge the potential for postdepositional translocation of the
archaeological record. Empirical data quantifying the process, however, are less common. This
paper reports the updated results of a long-term experiment designed to quantify subaerial and
subsurface displacement. After nine years, surface artifacts exhibit an average lateral movement
of 47 cm. In a separate experimental plot designed to eliminate specific transport agents, average
movement over the same period was limited to 18 cm. Vertical movement of buried artifacts was
also recorded, but transport agents selectively relocated artifacts based on specific physical
properties. The mechanisms responsible for artifact displacement are explored.

[28] Convincing LEO:Successful Interaction between the Archaeologist and Law Enforcement
Officials in Crime Scene Investigations
Law enforcement’s consultation with, and use of, civilian experts in processing crime scenes is
most often influenced by three factors: concern of expense; failure to realize potential evidence
which could be revealed through applied expertise; and issues of entrusting legally sensitive
material to non-law enforcement personnel. The presenter calls upon his experiences as a
contract archaeologist, criminal investigator, and forensic archaeologist to help explain the
relationship between law enforcement officials and academically trained archaeologists. The
perspectives of both positions are examined using case histories and knowledge of crime scene
processing guidelines. Suggestions are offered on how a cooperative and continuing relationship
might be developed between civilian and law enforcement investigators. Aspects of training and
cross-training represent the most basic blocks toward building a foundation of trust and
confidence between the expert and investigator. Once that rapport is established, it is only
maintained through the demonstration of archaeological protocols which recognize, preserve, and
document trace, environmental, and geotaphonomic evidence at crime scenes. Equally important
but often foreign to most non-law enforcement are the legal requirements and presentation of
evidence before courts of law. Understanding the differences and similarities between
archaeological and crime scene investigators is not difficult. Convincing law enforcement officials
of the archaeologist’s awareness of same requires concerted effort and long term program
planning on both sides.

[83] Understanding the Role of Climate Change in the Maya Past: Toward a Multidisciplinary
Collaborative Methodology
Scholars have argued very different positions regarding the role(s) that climate change has
played in the history of Maya civilization, particularly the Maya Collapse. We have suggested
elsewhere that tackling this complex topic requires the collection and integration of very disparate
datasets, close attention to temporal and regional variation, and a focus on the interrelationships
between changes in climate, culture, and environment. In this paper, we present an approach for
productive collaboration between paleoclimatology and archaeology for the Maya lowlands,
grounded in a specific case study of the upper Belize River valley.

July 2008 marked the first season of survey as part of the Aulavik Archaeology Project. The
project explores the seasonal use of the Banks Island interior, where generations of people spent
the summer months hunting, particularly during the late prehistoric and early historic periods.
Multiple tent rings, caches and graves are the physical markers of these journeys, and they were
revisited, re-made and reinterpreted over the years. Their distribution evokes a sense of
movement and cyclical time, and the features themselves suggest complex, fluid social networks
of people traveling as multiple family groups, single nuclear families and hunting parties.

[153] Late-Transitional Archaic Exchange in Eastern Massachusetts
The Late-Transitional Archaic period (ca 5500 – 2700 B.P.) is one of the most intensively studied
phases in eastern Massachusetts. Archaeologists have developed a robust picture of the
subsistence activities and the belief systems of that phase. The social dimensions of this period
are not as well studied. Yet there are several sites of this period which appear to have been
centers for the production and/or transfer of specialized artifacts to other sites in the region. This
suggests that there was a system of intra-regional exchange which related these centers to one
another and to the habitation sites in the region.

[48] Garbage is Garbage
The commonsense notion of garbage is an analytical creation that should be thrown away.
Garbage and its synonyms (trash, midden, refuse) derive from an anthropocentric definition of
society where people are the only social actors. When we reconceptualize society as the
interactions between people, objects (ecofacts, artifacts, architecture), nonhuman beings (e.g.,
ghosts, ancestors) and forces (e.g., mana), then we can escape our anthropocentricism and
begin creating new analytic terms. We argue that the method and theory of archaeological site
formation process research are productive; they simply need to expand the range of activities
played by nonhuman social actors.

Function and Use of Space at Sotira-Kaminoudhia, an Early Bronze Age site on Cyprus
This presentation concerns examining the spatial distribution of flint relative to other artifacts at
the Early Bronze Age site of Sotira-Kaminoudhia, Cyprus using GIS software. Since Sotira was
destroyed by an earthquake, a spatial analysis of artifacts offers insight on the direct use of space
because many artifacts were left in situ. The aim was to determine how flint was distributed
throughout various locations on the site and its correlation with other artifacts. My purpose is to
show that through the exploration of the spatial distribution of artifacts one can learn about the
function of diverse spaces at a site.

[131] “The Return of Irving Hallowell” or Why Archaeologists and Indians are Reading Old
American Ethnographies
In the post-NAGPRA era, growing trends toward collaborative research in archaeology have led
to rich interpretive frameworks for the discipline. Interactions with Native Americans reveal the
importance of continuity in technology, practice, belief, and identity. Particularly significant is the
increasing realization that nonwestern worldviews actively shape material production, use and
discard, thus impacting the formation of the archaeological record in untold ways. We envision a
co-future for archaeology where the ontologies reflected in these and other processes are not
only used for interpretation but also explicitly incorporated into archaeological method and theory.
A brief study of taxonomy illustrates this vision.

represents two disarticulated individuals at the base of lake deposits (diatomaceous earth). It
dates >10,000 14C years BP. Flakes recovered from the bone bed and the discovery of two out-
of-place Clovis points near the eroded margins of the bone bed raise a strong possibility that the
site is an intact Clovis feature. The activity area, probably a campsite, is on uplands ~650 m from
the bone bed. Systematic survey and testing of the area yielded hundreds of lithic artifacts
including complete and broken Clovis points, large blades, end scrapers, and bifacial thinning
flakes (including classic Clovis “overshot” flakes).

Merchantman
This paper is a discussion of an integrative and interdisciplinary approach to investigating site
formation processes within the natural and historical cultural settings of a select shipwreck site of
an historic merchantman in Ghana. The investigation of shipwreck site formation processes sets
the stage for the interpretation of events from an historical maritime past and supports the
investigations of wider cultural phenomena. In a region such as coastal Ghana, where relatively
little is known concerning the maritime environment and its effects on historic trade and on
consequent submerged cultural resources, an understanding of site formation processes is
foundational in terms of how sites are investigated and interpreted. Data from this shipwreck site,
in conjunction with data from experimental control areas, provide insights into historic trade in the
region, and make available a comparative data set for future investigations on a regional scale.

[64] Evidence for "Ritual Engineering" in the Royal Precinct Plan of La Milpa, Belize
The study of urban planning among ancient Maya settlements is neither without its difficulties nor
its detractors, but evidence suggests the Maya manipulated architecture to make cosmological
and political statements. While royal precincts at larger centers required careful engineering to
accommodate technological, sociopolitical, and ritualistic concerns, the cosmological/ritual
elements of site plans are perhaps most difficult to decipher. However, recent research at La
Milpa, Belize, suggests the ancient Maya explicitly engineered ritual elements into their planning.
Stylistically-related caches from Plaza B demonstrate ancient Maya "ritual engineering," which
served to unify otherwise discrete architectural elements within a plaza-based royal precinct plan.

Potters from late Neolithic northwestern China produced thousands of painted pottery vessels
decorated with intricate designs. Among their other uses, such pottery was commonly used as
grave goods to honor the deceased during this period. While the quantity of painted vessels
increased over time, more and more vessels gradually reveal less elegant manufacturing skills.
Specifically, the extent of pottery elaboration-in terms of the effort expended on design, surface

[88] Fracture Surface Characterization of Heat-Treated Cherts
Contact profilometry and fractal analysis are used to characterize the fracture surfaces of various
cherts commonly found in the archaeological record of the Lower Mississippi River Valley. The
effect of thermal alteration on the fracture mechanics of these materials is explored by comparing
measurements of fractal dimension (D) obtained by analysis of fracture surface profiles created
before and after heat-treatment.

[13] Embedded Networks? Pigments and Long-Distance Procurement Strategies in the Late
Prehispanic Southwest
Our previous research on glaze paint technology in the Zuni and Mogollon Rim regions has
identified local glaze paint recipes and tracked changes in these recipes through time. We have
also pinpointed sources for ores used to make glazes, indicating a variety of sources but a strong
connection with the Rio Grande region. This paper builds upon previous work, combining old and
new analyses to assess spatial and temporal diversity in interregional social networks among late
prehispanic Pueblo groups. We examine the idea that long-distance ore procurement was
embedded in other kinds of resource acquisition strategies.

Initial radiocarbon dates and general ceramic cross-ties indicate that the Central Mexican site of

Sixteenth century Spanish entradas into the Southeast inaugurated a number of dramatic

[131]Remembering then, remembering now: (de)constructing heritage in Yucatan, Mexico
Though contemporary Yucatecans share much with the ancient Maya—language, farming
techniques, etc—the notion of Maya continuity has undergone critical re-evaluation. Some
contemporary Maya speakers identify with the ancient past, some do not. Many are re-negotiating
their identity, thus highlighting the constructed nature of heritage. Despite these discontinuities
and instabilities, I argue that the very process of identity construction in the present anchors
people in the past. This is not just because rejections of the past are also rememberings of the
past, but because both past and present constructions of heritage share a key process: memory.

[83] The Great Maya Droughts: A Critical Introduction
In recent years, drought has gained popularity as the principal cause of several “collapses” in the
history of Maya civilization, including the Preclassic Collapse, the Maya Hiatus, and the Classic
Collapse. This paper introduces the key datasets used in most drought-driven models of collapse
and discusses the following issues that complicate assigning drought a principal causal role in
these processes: 1) the imprecision in dating paleoclimate and archaeological records; 2) the
challenges of coordinating distinct paleoclimate and archaeological sequences; 3) the difficulties
of quantifying climate change; and 4) a tendency by both archaeologists and paleoclimatologists
to simplify the other field.

Panama
Monagrillo pottery (ca. 4,500-3,200 B.P.) of central Panama is among the oldest pottery in
Central America. A petrographic study of small Monagrillo pottery samples taken from the Pacific
coast, the Pacific plain and foothills, and the Caribbean slope of central Panama suggested that
most pottery was made in situ using local clays but not all the pottery found on the coast and the
plain was produced there. Since the degree of pottery movement is unknown, we studied
Monagrillo pottery from a large number of sites from Central Panama and increased the sample
size. We conducted petrographic study to deduce pottery circulation. Our research provided
insightful result.

[143] Conflict and Climate in the North American Southwest
Changes though time in the distribution of settlements across a landscape, particularly spatial

differentials in potential resource productivity that influence the distribution of settlements. This

southern Arizona from A.D. 1200 to 1450. The extent to which climate variation and geographical
differences in resource productivity explain settlement pattern changes used as evidence for
endemic warfare in the region will be evaluated.

Several large shell middens along the west coast of South Africa are located in the Elands Bay

of the causes and consequences behind their formation. A productive environment
accommodated these changes initially, but signs of local impact on marine fauna were evident
later on. Re-formulation of subsistence strategies (intensification) and increase in ritual were
developed as coping mechanisms. Isotopic evidence from human skeletons shows that most of
the protein consumed during this millennium derived from marine resources.

archaeological sites. Radiocarbon dating of this marine material requires knowledge of the marine
reservoir age, R. In the global ocean, R averages 400 yr, but its value changes geographically
and temporally. Based on series of small-sample AMS radiocarbon dates from individual
Peruvian clam and scallop shells, R varies seasonally in Peru by over 500 yr, potentially
introducing a multi-century inaccuracy to local marine radiocarbon dates. We discuss strategies
for sampling and data interpretation to reduce this inaccuracy in a variable-upwelling
environment.

[61] Long Walks, New Neighbors and Old Ways: Evidence of Diaspora in the 14th Century
Southwest
In the late 13th century, Ancestral Puebloan migrants from northeastern Arizona joined local
populations along the Upper Gila and its tributaries to form new communities during a time of
demographic upheaval. Recent research on this migration and its aftermath suggests that
northern migrants maintained aspects of a shared identity despite dispersal throughout existing
communities, a hallmark of diaspora. Using the ethnography of diaspora, I argue that the
maintenance of post-migration social connections produces novel material culture configurations
visible in the archaeological record. The material evidence for a diasporic community in the
southern Southwest is evaluated in relation to ethnographic models.

[118] Milimeters and Base Pairs: Do Transverse Diameter and DNA Tell the Same Story
Salmon have long been an important species to populations in the Northwest. In reconstructing
the composition of ancient fisheries in the region, identifying salmon remains to the species level
is desirable, but unobtainable solely through morphometric means. We have developed a method
for species identification using a 189 base pair fragment in the 12S region of the mitochondrial
genome. All of the native Salmonidae species of the Northwest can be uniquely identified using
this method. Archaeological specimens from the Dionisio Point site, presumed to be those of
salmon, were evaluated for the effectiveness of transverse diameter measures for species
identification.

[167] A Eurasian Perspective on the Neolithization of Cultural Landscapes
The aim of this paper is to broaden analysis of the ‘Neolithization’ of cultural landscapes in East
Asia by deploying comparative perspectives from Northwestern Europe. In the latter region the
Neolithic – and Neolithization - has traditionally been linked to the dispersal of agriculture, settled
villages and pottery into northern Europe, either by colonizing farming populations or indigenous
adoption by local hunter-gatherers. Decades of research and debate have generated a useful
range of models, methods and theoretical perspectives that will be of considerable analytical
utility to scholars examining analogous Neolithic cultural transformations around East Asia’s
inland seas.

[181] Plaza One Reborn: Cuanalan and Tezoyuca Rising
In the valley of Teotihuacan rests the mystery of Plaza One- one of the earliest sections of an
ancient city poised on the brink of inception. In the remnants of what was are the findings of what
would be. And what would become is explored through a reanalysis of the ceramics excavated
from René Millon’s 1959 excavation of Plaza One within the city of Teotihuacan located in
present day San Juan Mexico. Preliminary findings indicate a rising count of Cuanalan and
Tezoyuca ceramics from the large assortment of Tzacualli shards uncovered from the site adding
to the mystery of Plaza One.

[172] Translating Project Management: Observations and Recommendations from the PO-29
Project
Archaeological investigations of Site PO-29 began with data recovery excavations in June of
2007 and concluded with the site's preservation a year later. Clearly, this project did not follow the
normal path of CRM archaeology. Along the way, the project also generated controversy over the
application of territorial versus federal historic preservation laws, methods, the roles of various
archaeological organizations in Puerto Rico, the curation of federal collections, and the
communication of project results. This paper examines the management of this site in the context
of Puerto Rican archaeology and provides recommendations for future CRM projects on the

[14] Native Americans on The Great Pee Dee River 1500-2000 AD
Spanish explorers were in SC in the 16th century, but only impacted the people of the Pee Dee
indirectly. More compelling was the pressure that arrived from the North, where British and
French traders were opening up new territories, and causing increasing conflict. By 1700 the Sara
had moved south from Virginia and settled at the NC – SC border. Undocumented groups also
arrived, and at least two individuals were left behind at the Johannes Kolb site. This paper will
discuss these individuals and introduce the audience to the Native American people of the Pee

[187] Potent agency and discourse patterns in epi-Olmec texts
Work in linguistic anthropology on the relation between language and cognition indicates that the
ways that people regularly talk about the world affect, and are affected by, the ways they regularly
think about it. Among the most consequential features of discourse are grammatically distinctions
that correlate with semantic properties; when these properties relate to social roles or values,
discourse patterns can have cultural significance. Agency in particular has been cogently
addressed through discourse analysis. This paper explores the relation between morphology and
agency in the epi-Olmec language, and how agency is tacitly engaged through grammatical
features in epi-Olmec texts.

[107] Identifying The Location of the Capital of the Maravi Kingdom Using Oral Traditions and
Archaeology
Until now, the only sources for what has been written about the proto-historic kingdom of the
Maravi have been based on oral traditions and a few scattered records of 17th century
Portuguese explorers. Oral traditions suggest that the capital of the kingdom was either at
Mankhamba or at Manthimba. While Manthimba has yet to be located, preliminary archaeological
results at Mankhamba suggest that the site was important but not necessarily the kingdom’s
capital. Research in both oral traditions and archaeology must therefore continue.

I listen to what archaeologists say with the ears of one initiated into Hopi religious traditions. I look

premise is the universal emotion of fear—Uti in Hopi—and how the Hopi initiations lead one to
transform it into Utihi’i—the sacred. We all share fear, but react and respond in different ways.
Archaeology helps me see contradictions in life and religion that we share. In a metaphorical

[4] The Fertility Zone: Body Fat, Hormonal Responses, and the Effects on Population Growth
Current demographic models continue to assume that high human fertility rates are a universal
and persistent constant in any calculation for explaining and predicting population growth which
gave impetus to the rise of civilization. The paper examines this assumption and offers a new set
of ideas that contradicts previous models. It is now established that physiological responses to
certain macronutrients or food packages, including high glycemic foods, affect hormonal
responses and ultimately the storage of body fat. It will be argued that it is the storage of body fat
which stimulates female ovulation and promotes fertility. This underlying proximate cause and
effect of human fertility explains why human populations expand when they do, and under what
conditions.

[99] Uxbenka Settlement Survey: Mapping Architecture in the Eastern Periphery of the Maya
Lowlands
This poster presents initial results of settlement studies at Uxbenka, and the application of new
high precision GPS technology to survey methodologies. Uxbenka is the earliest inhabited and
longest occupied Maya polity in southern Belize. Preliminary data suggest residential structures
were confined to hilltop locations, eschewing bottomlands. Additionally, settlements do not
appear hierarchically organized surrounding the site core, but are dispersed across the
landscape, with elite residential groups located >1 km out. Survey utilizing new GPS technologies
allowed rapid acquisition of landscape and architectural data. These data suggest resource
availability, rather than proximity to site core, guided elite settlement strategies.

[128] Toward Modeling Pre-Columbian Distribution of Geophytes: Camas in South-Central and

Ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological evidence suggest that camas (Camassia spp.)
was an important food resource across North America. Several species of camas grow across the
continent all with a preferred habitat of poorly drained, fine-grain sediment. An ecological model
based on climatic data and modern distribution of camas in Texas illustrates the probability of the
presence of camas in south central North America. The projection is tested against the modern
distribution of camas in adjacent states. Prehistoric distribution of camas is projected based on
paleoclimatic data and tested against archaeological sites with charred camas bulbs in Texas.

This paper examines changes through time in size and intra-site spatial patterns of Jomon shell-
middens in Tohoku, Japan. The focus of my research is to reconstruct the communal labor
system. The number of Initial and Early Jomon shell-middens is small. By the Middle Jomon
period, the number increased significantly, and it stayed steady through the Late and Final Jomon
periods. Middle Jomon shell-middens are large and ring-shaped. Final Jomon shell-middens have
thicker accumulation of shells, but they tend to consist of multiple smaller middens. These
indicate that the shell processing system shifted from the larger communal labor to family-based
one.

[132] The Archaeological Potential of a Huichol Landscape, Jalisco, Mexico
Socially significant components of a landscape are often designated with placenames. Examining
named places within an ethnographic setting is thus one means to assess the nature and scope
of a people's landscape. Here I identify characteristics of a Huichol landscape that can serve as
ethnographic source data for evaluating the archaeological record. I analyze the cultural and
physical properties of named places from data I collected during fieldwork in the Sierra Huichol.
Results reveal surprising similarities to placenames and landscape features of other sites in
Mesoamerica. This redundancy underscores the potential for archaeological applications of
knowledge from the Huichol landscape.

[172] House Patterns at Site PO-29: Preliminary Interpretations
This presentation will focus on pre- contact, Taino structural patterns, identified during phase III
investigations at the site PO-29 located on the Portuguese River, North of Ponce, Puerto Rico.
These structural patters are identifiable through sub-surface features which were identified
through hand excavations as well as machine assisted scraping. There are over 122 possible
post holes and associated features discovered at this site. These features have been extensively
mapped and documented and structural patterns are have been identified from preliminary as
well as ongoing analysis of this feature data. I plan to provide a brief overview of the type and
number of structures identified during this project, focusing on the spatial arrangements of house
patterns. This will be done by power point presentation and will include maps, photographs,
feature drawings and profiles. This is a complexly organized site and significantly increases our
knowledge of the settlement patterns and house structures during the pre-contact, Taino period in
Southern Puerto Rico.

Among the multiple dimensions of landscapes, scholars have generally emphasized those
aspects reflecting long-term occupation, especially those with evidence of residence or ritual
activity. However, certain areas of considerable economic importance have left few vestiges of

[182] Evaluating cave use through spatial analysis of animal remains from Maya caves in

Scholars have suggested that caves in the Maya region were used for ritual and represent

have suggested a variety of cave ritual functions and several cognized spatial divisions within
caves including high-low, light-dark, and a more complex ritual pathway based on the Maya
worldview. This zooarchaeological study will test these several models using GIS to explore the
distribution of animal remains within multiple cave sites in Belize and Guatemala.

[110] Technological Choices Related to Sand Temper Selection in Perry Mesa Plainware Pottery
During the 14th century, a series of large villages were occupied on Perry Mesa and other upland
areas in central Arizona. Petrographic and microprobe analyses of Perry Mesa plainwares
indicate that potters selected granitic sands and schist to temper their pottery instead of locally
available basaltic sands. The structural characteristics of granite and schist sands, such as their
hardness and angularity, may be one reason why these materials were preferred as tempering
agents. Our results imply that Perry Mesa potters carefully controlled the physical components of
their plainware pottery instead of relying on the closest available materials.

Archaeological Considerations
When considering the degree of isolation of prehistoric Sri Lankan Homo sapiens from those
occupying the Indian mainland, biological anthropologists, archaeologists, and geologists favor
the opinion that island Sri Lanka was a unique geographical sector of the Indian subcontinent.
Dating early human settlement of the island is considered with respect to the dispersion of
humans, plants, and animals across the land bridges of the Palk Strait and Adam's Bridge. The
conclusion is that the Sri Lankan prehistoric record provides overwhelming evidence that
anatomically modern Homo sapiens of the island shared less genetic and cultural communication
with mainland populations than assumed.

[25] For the Ferryman: Traversing the Neolithic waters of Liminal Space and Place
Recently the idea of seascapes to compliment landscapes as part of the way archaeologists
interpret evidence from the Neolithic period has been prevailed. This has led archaeologists to
think about the belief in the spiritual and physical power of the sea, and how it could have related
to the social interactions and their material manifestations. I am interested in how looking at the
physical and spiritual power of the sea as Cooney (2003, 324) puts it “…provides a better
understanding of how ships and sea travel, the acquisition of knowledge and material could be
seen by people as floating in symbolic counterpoint to the ship as a vehicle of death, taking the
occupants to another world.” The aim of this paper is actually to establish that it is the fact that
ships and sea travel requires specific knowledge and material that led to its association with
death throughout the Atlantic Neolithic. In addition it is that boats traverse liminal spaces and
inhabit liminal spaces that associated them with the transition/transformation from life to death. To
do this I look at the practices and evidence from the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition, and how the
concept of the liminal places such as islands and the coast as appropriate places for the
deposition of the dead was established in the Mesolithic and continued into the Neolithic. From
there I examine the ways in which overseas exchange networks separated those with knowledge
of the construction and use of water craft from their communities. The axe trade was an important
element of these overseas exchange networks and I look in more detail at the significance and
association with death. It is then a logical step to look at how stone became associated with
death, burials and ancestors. A lot of research has been done connecting stone with the water as
well as with liminality, and I explore the implications of this association as related to water craft.
To further develop the social, cultural and cosmological significance of water craft I draw in
ethnographic evidence throughout the paper as supporting evidence, but it becomes extremely
prevalent when looking at both the construction of boats as well as the transportation of
megaliths. The conclusions from this evidence suggests that knowledge and use of watercraft
was significant in the development in social structures during the Neolithic period.

osteological material from areas considered to be at high risk of looting. Although only two areas
received even moderately complete survey and collection, over 700 bones representing at least
23 individuals were recovered. The preliminary results suggest that MTC will produce the largest
human skeletal assemblage recovered from a cave in the southern lowlands. Multiple contexts
were encountered, including both single and multiple interments, as well as both primary and
secondary interment. A tentative interpretation of the findings is advanced.

[25] What makes one Roman?
The literary record provides a unified picture of what it was like to be Roman, but this picture only
reflects the lives of the literate upper class. Revealing the lives of the lower class residents of
Rome is still not a popular topic in Roman archaeology, and these individuals remain nameless,
unromanticized by history. Skeletons from two Imperial period Roman cemeteries, however,
challenge the notion that romanitas can be easily defined. Using stable isotope (C, N, and Sr)
data from 52 individuals, this paper explores differences in lifestyle among males, females,
children, and immigrants of the Roman lower classes.

[88] Virtual and 3-D Technologies: Innovative Approaches to Historic Preservation and Public
Outreach
Technology-based preservation solutions serve numerous practical applications in the historic
preservation field, including research, mitigation, education, and public outreach. Virtual
archaeology allows both professionals and the public to experience abstract concepts and ideas,
visit inaccessible sites, and examine objects from diverse and unique perspectives. Interactive
virtual recreations impart information regarding space and human experience, and are especially
valuable when deployed over the web. This paper demonstrates how technologically oriented
solutions provide unprecedented public access to cultural heritage resources and help bridge the
gap between academic archaeology and society at large.

[169] The Economics of Maya Complexity and the Complexity of Maya Economics
Ideas about prehispanic Maya sociopolitical complexity have advanced considerably since
scholars viewed them as peaceful people living around empty ceremonial centers. More data and
readable texts have revealed a contentious history that Mayanists continue to mine for models. In
contrast there has been a lag in our conceptualization of Maya economies. Despite Sharer’s
pioneering advocacy of markets and studies suggesting significant economic complexity, we tend
to view their economies as underdeveloped and subordinate to their political activities. This paper
argues that the western, utilist bias that still dominates our thinking prevents us from
understanding such differently complex economic systems.

[152] Temporal Variation in Lower Illinois Valley Middle and Late Woodland Mortuary Practices
Previous research has implicated differential treatment of dead in the (re)production of
ancestorhood and ancestor ideology in Lower Illinois Valley Middle (50 B.C. – A.D. 400) and Late
(A.D. 400 – 1000) Woodland communities. These ritual processes were not static across time
and space; and, finer chronological control is necessary to effectively model temporal and spatial
variation. In this paper, 23 new radiometric assays from Middle and Late Woodland cemeteries
supplement existing dates and are used to establish regional chronologies of funerary activity.
Changing practices are then linked to ancestorhood’s shifting roles in the negotiation of
community membership and ideology.

[68] Digging Identity: Recognizing borders among the ancient Maya
Economic relationships cross political and/or ethnic boundaries, making it difficult to discern
community identity in the material record. In addition, geographic proximity can result in stylistic
markers which are either shared across a political border or even purposefully responded against
within one. This paper argues that archaeologists must clearly differentiate the way they use
categories of artifacts to establish borders and frame communities. Data from Southeastern
Guatemala will be used to better hypothesize how borders can be recognized in the material
record and the extent to which these peoples might have seen themselves as ‘Maya’.

combination with regional field surveys. In practice, the reconstruction of technological traditions,
and the way landscape resources and techniques are conceived within the context of these

archaeological ceramics, in combination with raw material prospection, replication experiments
and ethnoarchaeology. Case studies will be based on research in two Aegean islands, Aegina

The Tiahuanaco influences reach northwest Argentina during the Regional Integration Period

recurrent motifs in Aguada iconography, ophidians, unlike felines and human characters, have
not been studied in detail. In this paper we analyze the patterns used to depict snake-like

themselves or combined with other species. Through iconographic analyses we have been able
to establish several representational themes and we have correlated them with ethnographic and
ethnohistorical information. Thus, we have a glimpse of the belief systems of the ancient
inhabitants of northwest Argentina.

explained by a dichotomy between mortuary temple mounds versus elite residence mounds. Elite
productive activities appear to be complementary between mound contexts, suggesting reciprocal
exchange of goods and services. I speculate that these activities produced a fabric of obligation
that temporarily countered the tendency of the Moundville polity to fission. The social setup is
profoundly segmentary rather than hierarchical.

Roots and Manioc among Pumé Foragers of Venezuela
Roots are key resources in many savanna environments. Until recent developments in starch
residue identification, archaeological appreciation of root contributions to past diets was
problematic. Roots are often assumed to drop out of diets during transitions to agriculture. Few
ethnoarchaeological data address this question. Pumé foragers of the Venezuelan llanos
continue collection of large amounts of wild roots in combination with low levels of manioc
cultivation. Analyses show that roots are more economically valuable than manioc and constitute
a significant proportion of the diet during the horticultural season. Pumé manioc cultivation helps
fund the persistence, rather than replacement, of foraging.

several sites in the vicinity of the Pueblo II (ca. A.D. 1050-1130) great house of Cerro Pomo in
west-central New Mexico. Building upon previous research, which has centered on the brown and
grey utility wares, this study focuses on decorated wares to further examine patterns of ceramic
production and distribution in this area. Results suggest differences in materials used to produce
decorated and undecorated ceramics, but assessment of raw clays indicates that all wares could
have been made locally.

[143] Tempos of Time – Pulses of Life: InisAirc, Ireland, 1907, through the eyes of Bridget
O’Malley
The material record of post-1850 coastal life, especially on remote islands such as InisAirc, Co.
Galway, illustrate the disintegration of the family unit, emigration pathways to America, and deep
personal histories. Drawing upon archaeological remains, historical records, and oral accounts, in
this presentation I develop a multi-faceted understanding of changing island life and community
through the eyes of Bridget O’Malley, an 11 year old girl who traveled to Boston in 1909. Her
story both humanizes and helps us understand cycles of community abandonment, the
movement of people within isolated coastal communities, and the social impact of local
emigration.

[164] Zuni Warfare: Does the Mortuary Record Reflect Ethnographic Information at the Hawikku
Site of New Mexico?
Examination of Zuni social organization and ceremonial life in the ethnographic record provides
insight into how the Zuni viewed warfare, both as a tool for socializing their youth and in their
general cultural view. As a result, bioarchaeological data from protohistoric burials at the Hawikku
site should reflect trauma, both healed and perimortem, as a physical indication of the emphasis
on warfare within the community. Analysis of trauma on 185 skulls suggests Zuni ethnographic
accounts describe a more symbolic role of warfare during the protohistoric period, instead of
active participation in violence related to warfare as part of daily life.

[171] Regarding Sixteenth-Century Native Population Change in the Northern Southwest
In contrast to popular perception, the Native peoples of the Southwest experienced only limited
demographic disruption during the sixteenth century. To emphasize the differences between the
U. S. Southeast and northern Southwest, we use criteria from the Southeast that established
catastrophic decline there. We examine evidence in four domains: settlement patterns;
bioarchaeology; historic narratives; and ethnogenesis. Collectively, the evidence indicates that,
despite Spanish intrusion, the Native sixteenth-century northern Southwest experienced relative
social and demographic stability. Factors that contributed to this stability included the sporadic
nature of Spanish exploration, the region’s distance from Mexico, and the discontinuous
distribution of Native populations.

[4] "Aguerridos Chanka": A Bio-archaeological Study of Group Violence in Peruvian Prehistory
This paper examines the relationship between identity and violence among the Chanka of
Andahuaylas, Peru, during the Late Intermediate Period (AD 1000-1400), a time of post-imperial
collapse which has been describes as "war-like" and "chaotic." Employing a bioarchaeological
approach, cranial modification--an important marker of identity in the ancient Andes--is correlated
with high levels of traumatic injury, indicative of interpersonal violence. These preliminary results
suggest that in times of sustained conflict and in the absence of a centralized authority, certain
groups of people may be disproportionately predisposed to interpersonal violence because they
are perceived of as “different.”

In 2004, the La Blanca Archaeological Project discovered a quatrefoil-shaped monument made
from sculpted, compact earth. Dating to the early Middle Preclassic (900-400 BC), that monument
is the earliest known Mesoamerican example of both earthen sculpture and the quatrefoil motif.
During the same field season, project members also discovered a cache of three stone spheres
located directly above the quatrefoil. This paper will describe and analyze those stone spheres. It
will consider their significance and meaning, and will explore what relationship, if any, exists
between the cache of spheres and the development of an institutionalized social hierarchy at La

[189] Apache Archaeology: Recent Research in the Chiricahua Mountains
Archaeological research concerning Apache archaeology in the Southwest U.S. has been labeled
tenuous at best. Locating historical-period Apache landscape occupations is difficult. Moreover,
interpreting these subtle traces through minimal diagnostic assemblages and historical-period
Euroamerican accounts does not highlight Apache interpretations of their former homelands,
which, still possess significant and powerful affiliations. This paper presents recent research in
Apache archaeology in the Chiricahua Mountains. By combining intense archaeological field
methods with on-site Apache interpretations a better understanding of historical-period Apache
life-ways can be delineated that not only highlights Apache archaeology but the unique ties
Apache people still hold to the Chiricahuas.

Analysis of a large collection of avian faunal remains (NISP=2,222) from the site of Homol’ovi I
resulted in the identification of approximately 44 species of birds, representing 23 families and 11

disposal of bird bones, and their material correlates. Such correlates provide an aid for
interpreting spatial and temporal variability in bird remains from Homol’ovi I and other early
Pueblo IV-period sites.

[16] Animal Magnetism? Assessing the role of pastoralism in the Andean highlands
Oft marginalised in the modern world, it is nevertheless apparent that pastoralism, or agro-
pastoralism, played a major role in the development of Prehispanic Andean highland economies.
Delving deeper, this paper then analyses the impact that pastoralism as a distinct social and
political system had on the development of South American society. In particular, I argue that
Andean cultural development witnesses two parallel developments, one coastal and the other
highland. In studying this dichotomy, I focus on the pastoralism as a determinant factor in the
cultural trajectory of the Andean cordilleras.

(examples: Midé society and Sun Dance), and that situation poses the question of whether such
a society could have been imported to prehistoric Moundville. Addressing that problem involves
determining what conditions are necessary to permit a local polity to adopt a sodality from alien
societies and what benefits might accrue from membership in such a sodality. Finally, do these
considerations provide archaeologically testable hypotheses?

evidence – as well as conventions in combat imagery – indicate a preoccupation with enemy-
outsiders. Beyond analogies to the Inka and historically known Andeans, salient comparisons can
be made between the ancient cultures and lowland Amazonian groups, where enemies (the
classic alter) become consumed and internalized into local arrangements and thought. Moche
and Recuay persons were made through a ‘culture’ of warfare, wherein both warrior and practice
were celebrated in public art/ritual.

[140] Racial Boundaries on the Frontier of Emancipation: Slavery at antebellum Poplar Forest
Plantations in central Virginia were established homelands by 1830, yet their inhabitants were
affected by shifting sociocultural boundaries and temporal frontiers. In the antebellum period, the
expansion of the market economy and transportation growth diffused slavery outside of
plantations and farms and into towns, commerce, and factories. This diffusion, and the increasing
number of hired slaves who filled these niches, had a significant impact on the institution of
slavery. The slave community at Poplar Forest provides a case study of the transformation of the
daily lives of enslaved laborers who remained on a plantation in this dynamic time period.

indicate that meridian symbolism began long before Chaco. For each of the four Pecos System
periods from BMIII to PIII the largest, preeminent site of each period was located on the meridian.
Eight centuries of landscape symbolism prior to Paquimé supports the idea that the last (PIV)
Chihuahuan center may indeed have been deliberately located on the Chaco meridian.

[145] The Application of 3D Laser Scanning Technology to the Assessment of Ordinal and
Mechanical Cortex Quantification in Lithic Analysis
A 3D digitiser is used to construct models of experimental lithic reduction sets. High-resolution
measurements concerning cortex area are extracted from the models and compared with
measurements obtained through ordinal and mechanical approximations of cortex proportion. A
considerable degree of error exists in the approximations due to over and underestimation in
surface area. However it is shown that representativeness of the estimates improves significantly
as sample size increases. Results are discussed in relation to recent studies by Dibble and
colleagues (2005) and Douglass and colleagues (2008) that use cortex proportion as part of a
proxy measurement for assemblage-scale curation.

[43] Diet and Nutrition on the Frontier: Dental Health in 19th Century Tucson.
As a frontier settlement in the American Southwest, 19th century Tucson was a multi-ethnic
community with strong ties to colonial Mexico and local indigenous populations. Dental health is
strongly influenced by diet, which can in turn reflect other factors, such as culinary preference or
ethnicity. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of an investigation of dental health in
the burial population of Tucson's National Cemetery. We infer social and dietary differences
within the burial population by evaluating patterns in dental wear, tooth decay, and evidence for
professional dental care.

[53] Guinea in Hyde Park: An Early Free Black Community in the Hudson Valley
The Guinea Community, in Hyde Park, New York, home to some 40 families of free Blacks and
fugitive slaves, from approximately 1790 through 1850, presents an opportunity to study the
formation of a northern African-American community living for the first time outside the constraints
imposed by slavery. The project’s preliminary results are interpreted comparatively to argue for
the vital role played by material culture in the construction of free African-American identities
during the process of gradual abolition in New York State. Three seasons of archaeological
excavation at Guinea, together with extensive preliminary documentary research, suggest that
the community’s residents participated actively in local and international consumer markets.
There is evidence that some of the people from Guinea community were well respected by
members of Hyde Park’s affluent White society. In this poster, the maps, photos, and narratives
provide an introduction to the Guinea Community Archaeological Project.

[136] Inscribed Pottery from Gola Dhoro: New Data on the Indus Script and the Social Power of a
Small Harappan Town
During the Indus, or Harappan, Civilization writing integrated diverse communities and conveyed
social power. Traders and merchants from large urban centers signaled control of certain
mercantile activities through formal writing on seals and tablets. However, my analysis of
inscribed ceramic vessels from Gola Dhoro (India) shows that writing was also used informally. At
this small, walled, craft producing community people inscribed both Harappan and non-Harappan
style vessels with Indus script. These data are compelling evidence that writing was not simply an
elite means of communication, but was also accessible to inhabitants of small towns with strong
ties to local traditions.

[44] Analyses of Stylistic Variability among Stemmed Obsidian Artifacts on Rapa Nui (Easter

The diverse shapes of stemmed obsidian artifacts (mata’a) from Rapa Nui have long been
suggested to represent idiosyncratic and non-patterned behavior. Here, we present analyses of
measurements consisting of descriptions of mata’a variability that are potentially heritable and
free to vary due to individual preferences. Due to the nature of their construction, these
measurements are explicable as the results of patterned cultural transmission across space and
through time. Using seriations constructed from multiple classifications and descriptions of mata’a
from locations across Rapa Nui, we identify patterns of spatial organization among prehistoric
populations of the island.

One of the better known attributes of Monongahela sites in western Pennsylvania is the presence

Imagery
A garment seen on many Late Formative west Mexican human effigies has been identified as a
quechquemitl, especially on figures with female sex characteristics. Closer examination indicates
this garment may have been misidentified. It is more likely the clothing being depicted is a tilmatli.
Similarities between the construction, decoration, and display of the west Mexican garment and
the Aztec tilmatli suggests it was used to signal social status. Interpreting the garment as a
tilmatli, rather than a quechquemitl, opens a window into social relationships, particularly related
to gender, and sociopolitical complexity in regions where the tilmatli is prevalently displayed.

[28] Entomology and archaeology – The effects of carbon dioxide on larval development
The following paper will discuss the effects of increased carbon dioxide levels on the activity of fly
larvae at a corpse. Entomology studies the behaviour of insects, in the case of forensic
entomology this is related specifically to behavioural traits of insects in relation to a corpse. This
study looks primarily at the function of fly larvae upon infestation of a corpse. In general flies are
the first of a succession of insects to visit a corpse and there larvae can be used to determine the
length of time a corpse has been exposed, with the purpose of estimating the time since death.
Although the behaviour of larvae is affected by a number of factors this study relates to the
inhibition in activity caused by increased carbon dioxide levels, such an occurrence could be
related to situations where a corpse is buried in an environment deficient in oxygen and is
proportional to the number of larvae present.

[119] Settlement Patterns and Inca Sacred Shrines in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Results of an
Archaeological Survey of the Copacabana Peninsula, Bolivia
Inca ideology has often been characterized by the domination of preexisting sacred places.
Shrines such as Pachamac, Tiwanaku, and Copacabana, were co-opted and subsequently used
politically as a means of legitimizing sovereignty and control over other Andean societies.
Through this strategy the Inca were able to materialize their cosmology and mythic history in the
conquered regions. Furthermore, the appropriation of important pan-Andean sacred places
necessitated transformations of local landscapes and involved the creation of a massive
administrative infrastructure. This paper will discuss the varied ways the Inca modified preexisting
shrines, and thus re-altered the landscape of the Copacabana Peninsula, Bolivia.

Mesoamerican archaeologists find it difficult to estimate pre-Hispanic agricultural productivity due
to poor archaeological evidence on agricultural features and cropping techniques. Researchers

and climate variability. The socio-economic implications of household food procurement and
underproduction are analyzed with relation to the broader regional political economy.

Research in the Ulúa Valley, Honduras has demonstrated a fundamental link between material

social memories of inhabitants through participation in life-cycle events. Rituals prominently
incorporated ceramic artifacts that were crafted by local communities and that demarcated social
identities in their figural representations, styles, and production techniques. These practices
inscribed social identities and affiliations among households, communities, and polities, creating a
landscape in which sites at multiple scales were nodes in complex webs of social relations.

For emerging Maya rulers, the participation and cooperation of people was achieved through
sponsoring public rituals. But not just any rituals; aspiring leaders used traditional rites writ large
as an integrative tool since such rituals situated political change within familiar social constructs.
Public ceremonies thus promoted solidarity—and political agendas. Maya commoners could
withdraw their support if rulers failed to fulfill their promises to reach the gods to bring forth
bountiful harvests, as was the case at the end of the Classic period (c. 850-950) when rulers in
the southern lowlands lost people’s support and all but disappeared.

changed at Lattara after the Roman conquest. I suggest that the incorporation of coinage into
systems of transactions at Lattara was related to its expedience as a standardized form of value,
which facilitated exchange between the inhabitants of the town and foreign merchants.

We present two new sets of palaeoecological and water chemistry data to understand ancient

groundwater rise, this area became a wetland in the Preclassic, and Maya farmers drained the
area to grow maize and other crops, and manage the area’s highly mineralized water. A nearby
field system, Birds of Paradise, reveals an abrupt changeover in the Classic from a forested
grassland to nearly complete dominance by Marantacea in the Postclassic.

landscape at the Hopeton Earthworks was built between A.D. 75 and A.D. 200. Middle Woodland
people moved more than 30,000 cubic meters of soil, and stripped the topsoil from nearly 40
acres in creating this geometric earthen enclosure. Excavations in 2008 provide evidence that the
rectangular and circular enclosure walls were built as a single unit. Comparison of wall
construction methods between earthwork sites indicates that although some characteristics of
wall construction were likely common to most sites, each embankment site was unique.

[171] Florida Outreach
The Florida Adelantado, Pedro Menéndez de Avilés, whose granted territories stretched from
Newfoundland to the Florida Keys, sailed in 1565 to found St. Augustine and expel the
Frenchmen who had settled in Florida. He built his capital at Santa Elena on Parris Island and
from there sent expeditions to the Appalachians and the Chesapeake. Menéndez established
relations with Native American groupings in his wide territories. Fort-missions were constructed
around the Florida perimeter. The Jesuit missions failed and Menéndez could not adequately
support his colonial enterprise. But St. Augustine remains the oldest continually occupied city in
the United States.

[13] A Community of Practice in Diaspora: The Rise and Demise of Roosevelt Red Ware
Crown has linked the origin of Roosevelt Red Ware to Kayenta immigrants and has modeled a
community of practice that connected immigrants and locals in the context of a cult. Evidence of a
more exclusive relationship between Kayenta immigrants and Roosevelt Red Ware production
has since emerged. Links among immigrant enclaves and between these dispersed nodes and a
broadly conceived northern homeland have also been documented. Kayenta immigrants and their
descendants, who made Roosevelt Red Ware, maintained a community of practice in diaspora.
Here, we explore the interplay of structure and agency as this community evolved and eventually
disintegrated.

[130] Laterality and Directionality in Pottery Painting and Coiling
In this project, the consistency of the directionality (clockwise versus counterclockwise) of painted
lines and coiled bases on archived pots was studied to determine tolerance within an open or
closed cultural learning framework. An experiment was carried out which linked directionality of
pots with the handedness of the potter in an open system. These results were then compared
with data from archaeological pots from sites in the Point of Pines area, Arizona (AZ W:10:50).
Maverick Mountain, Point of Pines Polychrome; McDonald, Point of Pines Corrugated were used
to extrapolate artistic tolerance with degrees of variation within and between types.

[155] Surveying the Agricultural Landscape: A Review of Methods
Every archaeological project involved in rural surveys will have to deal with mapping the
agricultural landscape. Drawing on the collective experience of surveying terrace systems around
the globe, different methods will be explored; examining applicability, effectiveness, efficiency,
and cost. These methods involve tape and compass, theodolite, Global Positioning Systems, and
satellite imagery. While the primary focus is on terrace farming the experiences can be
transferred to the surveying of many other agricultural strategies. This paper focuses on work
conducted in Greece on the island of Antikythera and in Belize at the ancient Maya site of
Minanha.

[86] Urban Identities: Social and Spatial Production at Classic Period Chunchucmil, Yucatán,
Mexico
While some researchers have questioned the degree of lowland Maya urbanism, we show that
Chunchucmil was a major urban center, with a population of thirty to forty thousand people and
the highest settlement density of any site in the Maya lowlands. Located along a vigorous
maritime trade route, it developed as a city in the late Early Classic (AD 400-650) with a complex
infrastructure and market economy to accommodate its residents and the influx of rural and
foreign visitors. We look at the production and construction of urban spaces by its residents and
how these in turn shaped their urban identities.

[25] The Spaces of Death: The Ins, the Outs and Beyond
The Icelandic Viking Age landscape is somewhat unique in that there were no permanent
inhabitants in Iceland prior to the Norse arrival in 874 CE. This allowed the settlements as well as
the burials to be placed in locations of significance to the group, rather than having to conform to
an existing mortuary landscape. These burials represent a small window of time, approximately
125 years, and creates an opportunity to shed light on the social and political ideology of the
group based on their ability to define an “empty” landscape with their dead.

[37] Not Just the End Game Anymore: Proactive Budgeting for Project Curation Needs in a
Changing Archaeological World
More often than not, the curation of recovered collections is an afterthought, both for those who
fund archaeology and for those carrying it out. Minimal consideration is given to the impact of
prefield and field decisions on the artifacts recovered, processed, analyzed, prepared for curation,
and ultimately curated. The nationwide curation crisis forces the realization that the responsible
treatment of archaeological collections begins when clients first contemplate a project and
continues throughout a project’s duration and beyond. Actual examples of budgeting for curation
costs consider requirements such as in-field recording, sampling, conservation, digital archiving,
and curation in appropriate repositories.

This paper discusses on the transformation of agricultural landscape in Neolithic Changjiang

technologies, but should be considered as a complex in which both a cultivation system and a
cooking/serving system are combined. Under this point of view, it will address that the cultural
landscape mainly determined by its given natural surroundings in early Neolithic transformed into
a more complex landscape in which socio-cultural factors performed a more crucial function in
late-Neolithic, Songze Culture onwards.

common supraethnic warriors rituals instead a fortified - like the Roman limes - border. So the
ritual war and the conquest war don't exclude one another in the context of the archaic state,
incipient military technology, and particular warrior ethos.

Recent investigations at Currusté, a Classic period center in the Ulúa Valley, Honduras, focus on
the interpretation of the site for professional and public audiences as it is developed into a

[85] Becoming insular? Human responses to climate change and rising sea levels along the
coasts of western Sicily from the Late Pleistocene to the Mid-Holocene
From the end of the last glacial epoch, climatic warming and associated rises in sea levels
affected the anthropic occupation of coastal environments. The impact of such environmental
changes on human settlement and subsistence was probably most extreme in coastal areas that
became isolated as a result of post-glacial sea level rise. One such region is western Sicily,
where two of the present-day Égadi Islands (i.e. Levanzo and Favignana) only became islands in
the early Holocene. Isotopic data from faunal and human remains, presented in this paper,
provide evidence on human adaptations to developing insularity in this Mediterranean coastal
environment.

Interregional interactions hardly happen between homogenous groups. Both the expansive state

that the effects of Wari or Tiwanaku were likely present at the top socio-political settlements and
limited at the villages. The Analysis of the archaeological site “Lote B” a village settlement in the
Lurín Valley shows a limited impact of Wari, and important transformations related to the

creation of strong sedimented community and household identities rooted in the longue durée of
daily repetition, history, and memory – hallmarks of earlier Mississippian communities. Quite the
opposite, this environment favored strategies that were the very antitheses of those that
constituted Mississippian identity – short-term strategies that emphasized flexibility and

contexts of mound formation and deformation.

[50] Bodies, Burials, and Boundaries: Variability in Late Bronze Age (1500-1200B.C.) Mortuary
Practice in the South Caucasus
The cemetery is an important axis point in the interpretation of socio-political complexity and
organization of mortuary data within and between sites. As a formal and ordered space, the
cemetery is often portrayed as representative of centralized organization, and the result of
communities claiming resources and territory and identifying themselves in contrast to other
groups. However, variability within cemeteries is seen as a means of social distinction and
differentiation. Mortuary practices in the South Caucasus Late Bronze Age (1500-1200 B.C.)—a
period of socio-political reorganization—challenge many of our assumptions about the
organization of burials and that of living society.

[45] Local Economic Reactions to Middle Horizon Integration and their Implication to
Sociopolitical Complexity: Evidence from the Coast of Ecuador
It is argued that control of prestige items bestowed elites with prestige that helped them
consolidate power and fomented social complexity. The unprecedented rise of large states and
expansive trade networks during the MH offer us the opportunity to test these assumptions. Data
from the Spondylus manufacturing industry of coastal Ecuador suggest that the industry mainly
affected sociopolitical development by providing an added source of income directly to the
domestic unit. Influxes of surplus to the nuclear household can create the centripetal forces that
cause population nucleation, which makes specialization and political development comparatively
cheaper than in less nucleated communities.

Finger-applied black paint decoration is the primary decorative marker for the Guangala Phase,
Regional Developmental Period of coastal Ecuador (ca. 300 BC – AD 600). Vessels bearing this
decoration are viewed as insignificant beyond cultural period identification. Petrographic analysis
yields evidence of chronologically significant changes in fabrics which correlate with changes in
surface treatment, form, vessel size and burn patterns. These in turn may be related to observed
shifts in faunal assemblages and settlement patterns. The information on technology revealed
through petrographic analysis of these consistently ignored “domestic” wares suggests a
relationship between technological change, diet, cooking methods and socio-economic factors.

[48] Commoner Recycling or Ritual Practice? Mesoamerican Commoners Appropriating Elite
Traditions
Mesoamerican elites changed site layouts over time, essentially cutting off commoners from
ceremonial precincts. This segregation may have led to disengagement in state rulership,
resulting in passive resistance to authority. This condemnation of leadership is evidenced by non-
elites appropriating sacred spaces and reuse of abandoned elite objects. At the elite level,
destruction and recycling is explained as "ritual," while at the commoner level it is argued to serve
"practical" purposes. This paper argues that scholars need to reassess their interpretations of
non-elite reuse of elite materials as simply serving functional purposes and reconsider it as its
own form of ritual.

from other typical EBA burials at Titris Hoyuk. One interpretation of the public display is that the
individuals buried there were outsiders to the community, perhaps casualties of warfare. Studying
the genetic relatedness of individuals buried across Titris Hoyuk allows preliminary assessment of
this interpretation and provides further insight into Mesopotamian social structure.

[90] Human Mortuary Deposits and the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP)
Mortuary sites and human remains must be addressed as part of the restoration project. Native
American and CERP management agencies recognize human remains as "Trust
Responsibilities" and distinct from other cultural resources. This interpretation places the
management of human remains outside the range of standard Section 106 procedures. The
proportion of sites with human remains is slightly higher in the CERP area than in the rest of
Florida. They therefore represent significant management challenges. The distribution of human

[87] Large-Scale Variation in Turquoise and Shell Ornamentation in the Late Prehistoric
Southwest
Anthropological research has shown that personal adornment is often highly associated with
various aspects of social identity. This paper explores broad variation in worn ornamentation in
the late prehistoric Southwest, and discusses these patterns in terms of identity and interaction
on a macro-regional scale. This discussion focuses on turquoise and shell, and compares the
spatial distributions, forms, and contexts of use of jewelry made from these two major material
types.

[53] Hunter-Gatherer Resource Intensification and Changing Patterns of Fire-Cracked Rock
Features in Central and South-Central Texas
Using Binford’s (2001) recent work, researchers (see Freeman 2007; Johnson and Hard 2008;
Thoms 2008) suggest that Central and South-Central Texas hunter-gatherers should intensify on
plants throughout the Archaic and Late Prehistoric periods as population growth increasingly
restricts subsistence options. We explore these suggested patterns of intensification by focusing
on temporal changes in the density of rock features used primarily to process low return plant
resources. Data from several hundred features on over 80 components demonstrate that with
some exceptions, the patterns are consistent with the suggested increasing intensification on
plants, especially late in the sequence.

[15] Portachuelo de Charcape. Rethinking the Mochica warfare in the lower Jequetepeque Valley
The presence of defensive sites in the lower Jequetepeque Valley during the late Moche period
has been interpreted as evidence of endemic and prolonged conflict between local communities.
In this hostile environment, Portachuelo de Charcape stands as an exception, without evidence of
defensive features. Based on the archaeological evidence recorded in Charcape and in other
contemporary sites such as San José de Moro, Cerro Chepén and San Ildefonso I will discuss
the role of social integration vis a vis conflict and, I will address the nature of warfare in this region
in contrast to other models of Moche coercive action.

[42] Late Prehistoric Community Ritual in the Rural Black Warrior River Valley
Investigations at several Late Woodland and Mississippian sites in the Black Warrior Valley
indicate the widespread use of elaborately decorated fineware ceramics, traditionally linked to the
socio-political elite. At these rural sites, the ceramics are found with subsistence remains and in
contexts suggestive of feasting. Evidence from 1TU66 also suggests that these practices may
predate the rise of the Moundville polity. We suggest that this pattern reflects long-standing,
community-based ritual practice associated with towns, similar to the town of the historic
descendents of the Mississippian peoples of the Lower Southeast.

Kazane Höyük, outside modern ªanliurfa, southeastern Turkey, is one of the largest known sites
belonging to the Halaf cultural horizon (5900-5350 cal. B.C.E.). The largest structure found during
the 2004 excavations in Kazane’s outer town contained a cache of over 56 cattle astragali (ankle
bones). Comparanda from contexts elsewhere suggest that astragalus collections carried cultural
significance beyond meat-processing refuse. This multivalent cache’s relationship to a) incipient
craft specialization, including pastoralism and hide production b) counting devices and c) feasting,
augury and gaming will be discussed to provide insight into the poorly understood political

Ahar-Banas Pottery Production As Seen From Gilund
Localized pottery production in southeastern Rajasthan dates from 3000 to 1700 BCE and
correlates with the earliest phases of the Ahar-Banas Cultural Complex, which incorporated over
100 sites, including Gilund, a large agro-pastoral settlement. Material culture comparisons from
contemporary sites in Northwestern India, Sindh, Iran, and Bactriana situate Gilund as an
important node in a trans-regional interaction sphere involving many polities and economic
systems. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the Gilund pottery. Its ultimate goal is to
delineate levels of Ahar-Banas integration into this interaction sphere by comparing contexts of
intra- and inter-site pottery production, use, and distribution.

[16] The earliest Saharan mobile pastoralists: already socially complex?
Social complexity is posited to have emerged among the pastoral societies in the Central Sahara
and Sahel by 4000 BC. 'Mobile elites' within cattle-keeping groups developed prestige-goods
economies leading to wealth accumulation. Settlement data and archaeological assemblages
now suggest that such elites emerged in the Eastern Sahara as early as 5400 BC. In Dakhleh
Oasis Egypt, sites of pastoral nomads feature special structures and many of the 'valued objects'
associated with the later mobile elites, such as small axes and stone beads. These mid-Holocene
mobile elites may have played a role in the emergence of complex society in Egypt.

ancient contexts is impossible to analyze, however insight can be gained into the value of ritual
residues at Copan where offerings containing cacao, and other foods, once placed in ritual
spaces were not discarded when new vessels were introduced.

the past 40,000 years. Specifically, we examine what these data indicate about terminal
Pleistocene climates and environments in the Colorado Rockies, and the challenges these
presented to Folsom Paleoindians.

[90] Reconsidering Everglades Prehistory: Archeological Evidence for Holocene Variability and
Early Human Settlement
The 1989 East Everglades Expansion Act added an additional 107,600 acres to Everglades
National Park. While the land was added to facilitate increased water flow into the Park from
restoration projects, recent archeological investigations by the National Park Service have
revealed 42 previously unrecorded significant sites. Testing of these sites included excavation
into the enigmatic "calcrete" layer that had been noted on other sites in South Florida. The results
of this study have much to contribute to the culture history of the Everglades, as well as inform
broader scientific inquiry of the ecosystem.

[175] Micromorphology and geochemistry of the mountaintop sanctuary of Zeus on Mt. Lykaion,
Greece.
Mt. Lykaion is a Classical Greek athletic complex located in the central Peloponnese. The
sacrificial altar to Zeus is an anthropogenic deposit characterized by abundant by-products of
combustion including calcined bone, ash and fire-cracked rock. Micromorphological and
geochemical study of the altar was undertaken in order to determine composition of the sediment
and preservation of burned features. Preliminary results indicate that the effects of post-
depositional processes such as bioturbation and carbonate dissolution are variable with depth. As
a result, ashes are not preserved in the upper 30-40 cm of the deposit. Available phosphorus is
high and correlates negatively with carbonate.

[65] A comparative perspective on central place communities
This paper focuses on the nature of household interaction (e.g. craft specialization, feasting,
exchange) in central place communities in three regions in the Intermediate Area: Central
Panama, Barinas (Venezuela), and the Muisca region of Colombia. A comparative perspective on
the developmental trajectories of local scale communities allows us to evaluate various models
for the emergence of complex society in Central America and northern South America. The
organization of household production, the focus of the chiefly political economy and patterns of
community growth and interaction are compared between these three regions.

areas with the highest density of Clovis bifaces are consistent with landscape positions used by

Throughout his career, Gregory Possehl has been instrumental in both highlighting the regionally

He has also been interested in the material evidence for regional interactions, most recently
through late period sealings and seals. The nature of the Indus weight system, re-evaluated from
a regional as well as a pan-Indus perspective, relates to all of these topics. The uniformities and
diversities of Indus weights provide key insights into the nature of economic control in this ancient

major question that needs to be answered is one of cultural affiliation. Connections between the
Jhukar and the post-urban phase in Gujarat have been hinted at by others, but never fully
explored due to our poor understanding of the Jhukar. In this presentation I would like to honor

of the upper-lower platform and that the mound was probably built nearly its full 8m height by 890

A comparative analysis of prehispanic Andean cities indicates significant discontinuities in the
organization of public space. Although architectonic components and architectural inventories
recur in different urban traditions, there are marked differences in the overall plans of Andean
cities and few continuities between the earliest Andean urban centers and earlier Formative
settlements. This suggests that the prehispanic Andean city was developed divergently and
employed different principles of urban design, and that Andean societies deployed different forms
of what Eric Wolf called “structural power,” in which the urban landscapes were the settings for
different forms of power interactions through Andean prehistory.

20,000, yet the ephemeral nature of the building materials used in the peripheral residential
sector has left little visible evidence of architecture at the surface. Hampered by the inability to
make large-scale characterizations of the organization of urban and monumental space through
excavation alone, several geophysical prospection techniques have been employed during recent
research. This paper will present how the results of topographic mapping, electrical resistivity,
ground penetrating radar and magnetometry serve to clarify the broad spatial configuration of the
Mollo Kontu sector.

[160] “Wealthy in Heart”: Oral History of Life before Fort A. P. Hill
In 1941, the government acquired 60,000 acres in Caroline County and hundreds of families
sacrificed their lands for their country. From the government’s perspective, it was a necessity. For
those whose land was taken, there was no alternative but to go. For all, their stories remained
untold. The oral history project identified individuals who lived on the land before acquisition and
captured their history in their own words. In total, 82 hours of interviews were recorded with 58
informants. In gathering this data, a unique archive of primary historical material has been
captured on the very cusp of its loss.

[174] A Meal in a Dish: Food-Related Economics in an Early 20th-Century Tucson, Arizona,
Neighborhood
Multiple lines of evidence are evaluated in this study of socioeconomic status in an early 20th-
century neighborhood. Faunal remains provide direct evidence of certain food choices, and those
choices may provide indirect evidence of a family's socioeconomic standing. Food choices,
though, are often limited by availability as well as by social constraints. Ceramics can also serve
as indicators of choice and status. This study uses faunal bone and ceramics collected from privy
contexts to examine consumer choice in an economically- and ethnically-mixed neighborhood.
Inferred differences in public and private choices and everyday and special occasion dining
practices are explored.

As part of Fort A. P. Hill’s alternate mitigation program, PSA’s work on nineteenth and twentieth
century farmsteads has included traditional archaeological fieldwork and research, combined with

were frequent grave goods in elite burials across temperate Eurasia. Mirrors and horse
paraphernalia were components of a “nomadic tool kit” common to many Iron Age steppe
cultures; but is the co-incidence of mirrors and horses really just a coincidence? Moreover, while
nomads were doubtless instrumental in the wide distribution of both technologies, their presence
together in burials of contemporary sedentary societies warrants closer investigation. This is
especially true since British Iron Age mirrors likely reference elements of horse harness.

Study of pottery production in the Maya region so far has been hindered by the near complete

the Late Preclassic to the Terminal Classic periods, making it an optimal test case to look for non-
artifactual evidence of pottery (and salt) production. We use SEM, FTIR, and micromorphology to
analyze the presence/absence of processes such as pyroactivity and salt permeation into
ceramics through brine boiling.

In this paper, I combine original survey data with published information to explore change in
settlement behavior and society in Bavaria during the Neolithic period (5500 to 2200 BC). Early
agricultural colonists initially focused on a specific ecological adaptation while maintaining strong
communal practices. During the Middle Neolithic (ca. 4800 BC), these large communities began
to fragment, expanding into previously marginal ecological zones and transforming traditions of
social representation in mortuary behavior and domestic space. By the later Neolithic (4000 BC),
the representation of “community” was challenged by the appearance of cults of individual –
rather than communal – identities.

[53] Subsistence context of pottery evolution in southeast Texas
About 2000 years ago, the prehistoric mobile foragers who lived along the Texas coast began to
make pots. Unlike other regions, pottery is not linked to intensive seed exploitation. Thus, to
understand the reasons for pottery adoption, we need to understand the broader subsistence
context into which it was adopted. During the Late Archaic, human populations expanded and
deer harvest pressure increased. Changes in decisions regarding prey and patch choice, carcass
exploitation, and within-bone nutrient exploitation are expected. These subsistence changes may
be shed light on why pottery became important to south Texas Native Americans.

[187] Structuration and the state in Late Bronze Age Greece
This paper models the Mycenaean state from the perspective of Giddens’ theory of structuration,

The administrative texts found in the palatial center provide information about a large number of
named individuals, many of whom must have been elites with substantial personal holdings.
These agents were managers of economic activity controlled and monitored by the palace. The
Mycenaean state is profitably analyzed as a structure reproduced by individuals, whose economic
and social strategies are both enabled by the state and constrained by it at the same time.

Architectural redundancy within contemporary archaeological contexts generally suggests

redundancies - such as multiple populations, divergent identities, and competitive moieties, are
suggested. Most shell rings found in the Southeast are paired with one or more rings. The

Wari expansion into Moquegua was originally interpreted as an intrusive colony with two major

efficiency and sustain hunter-gatherer economy, and that agriculture maintained foraging
efficiency by prolonging access to high-ranked resources. Stored cultigens along the northern
slope of the Uinta Mountains may have allowed hunter-gatherers more time to spend in the
pursuit of high-ranked resources.

[48] Discarding “Trash”: Reconceptualizing Above-Floor Deposits Excavated at El Peru-Waka’s

Mesoamerican scholars recurrently utilize the concept of trash to characterize a variety of discard

is not intended, exploration of its implausibility as a description of the deposits at M13-1 and for

was occupied between the 13th and 15th centuries. These dates as well as the presence of at
least two stockades raise the possibility of multiple components. Various stratigraphic and

[112] Art and Artifact Agencies: The Art of James Luna and Michael Kabotie
Artists and archaeologists have equally intense, although different engagements with the
meaning and agency of objects in material culture. The same can be said for native people and
researchers whose concerns with archaeological and ethnographic materials can both contrast
and coincide. Two distinguished Native American artists, James Luna (Luiseno) and Michael
Kabotie (Hopi) speak to the connections and divergences they have explored in their careers
between art and archaeological practices. In distinct ways, each has referenced archaeology to
activate and revitalize the roles of artifacts and images, expanding their powers to critique, to
heal, and to interact with contemporary audiences.

A wide array of intellectual property (IP) concerns relating to cultural heritage is now part of the
archaeological landscape, affecting practitioners, descendant communities, and policy makers
alike. The “Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage Project” (IPinCH) brings together
scholars and practitioners from many different fields to collaborate with partnering organizations
and communities in an exploration of these issues through community-based participatory
research. The Project's objectives are to document the diversity of situations and concerns
arising in regard to IP issues in cultural heritage, to analyze the theoretical and practical

[166] Rethinking Huitzilipochtli’s Conquest: Liz Brumfiel, Social Theory, and the Aztecs
Liz Brumfiel began work in Aztec studies by tackling nothing less than testing the economic
symbiotic model of Aztec exchange and specialization. Her findings at Huexotla and Xico
questioned this model and in its place Brumfiel has focused on the politics of exchange and
strategies of both state power and commoner households. Her long-term archaeological project
at Xaltocan builds on and expands those themes by applying social theories to understand Aztec
society, and inequalities more generally, from a bottom-up agency perspective. These intellectual
commitments also motivate Brumfiel’s engagement with community archaeology and her
professional leadership.

[67] Reconstructing the Cave: Speleothems from Archaeological Contexts in the Southwest
Cave formations or speleothems have been recovered from archaeological contexts in the
Southwest, but reporting has been inconsistent. To make matters worse, since many
speleothems are unmodified, they do not qualify as artifacts, while others may be so heavily
processed as to be unrecognizable. To date no systematic study has attempted to document their
distribution or interpret their use and meaning. Preliminary research suggests that some
speleothems were considered to be living beings, and functioned in a variety of ritual contexts.
Patterns of speleothem harvesting and use in the Southwest show parallels with those
documented in Mesoamerica and the Southeast.

South Andes
Focusing on archaeological evidence left in marginally occupied areas (“inter-nodes”) by the
practices responsible for the transportation of goods between permanently settled regions
(“nodes”), we identify two general modes of long-distance circulation. Specialized traffic involved
journeys that left only ephemeral but distinctive remains of their transit through the “internodes.”

Embedded traffic, on the other hand, took place in the inter-nodes, where task groups from
distant regions converged seasonally to hunt and gather, engaging in multiple forms of exchange
as part of these periodic, multi-ethnic encounters. We discuss the social implications of these
different but partially overlapping forms of circulation.

[8] Correcting Cadavers. The Ritual Response to the Anxiety of Death.
At the death of an individual, the survivors are left not only with complex emotions, but also with a
human cadaver. The abject status of the cadaver (Kristeva 1980), located between subject and
object, between living being and human remains, creates anxiety as it challenges the ontological
order of life. Ritual becomes a strategic way to act in response to this state. Through a
combination of ritual theory and an archaeological methodology focused on recovering the
treatment of the body we can recover the traces of these actions and discuss anxiety as a
dimension in mortuary practices.

[8] Feet of Clay: An Archaeology of Huedan Elite Anxiety in the era of Atlantic Trade
In archaeological accounts of the Dahomey Gap region, elite West Africans are often
characterized as bellicose regional administrators and iron-fisted military commanders. Previous
studies focus on the role of artifacts and architectural features in projecting and bolstering their
authority. This paper addresses a more subjective state of elite African existence; the
anxiousness inherent to a region rocked by slaving raids and wholesale warfare. It argues that
archaeologically recovered earthenware offerings, originally placed under living surfaces and in

[177] How to say things with bodies: The semiotics of violence on the Mormon frontier
Dead bodies are powerful media for conveying political messages. Yet to understand what is
being communicated, we must consider events from the perspectives of both the performers and
their audiences. Moreover, we must be aware of the supremely ambiguous nature of human
remains—their capacity to say different things to different people. During a single performance,
political actors can draw and redraw group boundaries, uniting some people while excluding or
even threatening others. Here I focus on the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre, one case in
which human remains have been deployed to communicate an array of political messages.

Recent research proposes that ancient Maya commoners contributed to the continued formation

Late Preclassic developed a space for community ritual and linked Chan to broader social and
political changes in the Maya lowlands. Using bioarchaeological, ceramic, and architectural
evidence, we explore ritual activity to address how the residents acted within a pan-Maya belief
system, and structured this belief system given their unique social and historical context.

[18] Metaphor, Material Culture, Ritual, and Community Formation: Conus Shell Tinklers in the
American Southwest
Symbolic associations exist in Hopi cosmology among rain, shell, and pronghorn. The
formalization of these associations into a rain-making sodality may be archaeologically
identifiable through Conus shell tinklers, which initially appear at late Chacoan sites like Aztec.
Tinklers were included in the formal ritual costume of the Magician, who was buried ca. A.D. 1175
in the cultural frontier zone of the Flagstaff region. Tinkler use subsequently spread to 13th-
century multiethnic coalescent communities along the Mogollon Rim and in the Tonto Basin. This
and other data suggest the emergence of social ideals of distributive power among sodalities that
controlled complementary rituals.

The Tibbee Creek site in east Mississippi, has been considered since its excavation in the 1970’s
as a classic example of a small Mississippian Farmstead. Recently, however, comparison to
similar structures at the Lubbub Creek, Fatherland and Hiwassee Island sites suggests strongly
that the main structure has a distinctive form usually associated with mounds, temples and
charnel structures. Viewed in this way, the unusual burial programs associated with the structure
suggests one of the burials is of an elite individual while others are likely retainer burials such as
documented historically with the Natchez. This paper presents this new interpretation.

[119] Ceremonial Centers in the Titicaca Basin Formative Period: New Data from Khonkho

The massively primate urban center of Tiwanaku emerged out of a landscape of small ceremonial
centers scattered across the southeastern Titicaca Basin. These Formative period ceremonial
sites have most often been described as loci of increased concentration of population and
economic production; Tiwanaku’s development is generally seen as an intensification of this
process. However, data from Tiwanaku’s close neighbor, Khonkho Wankane, strongly suggests
that a new type of ceremonial center was developing in the latter part of the Formative period (AD
250-500). This paper summarizes these new data and suggests new avenues for understanding
the Titicaca Basin Formative.

[112] Creation and Persistence of Sacredness in Ancient Maya Sculpture
Ancient Maya stone sculptures were made sacred when created, fundamentally transforming the
stone’s nature. Twentieth-century Ch’orti’ Maya year-renewal ceremonies provide a fruitful
analogy, for in them priests constructed a world-renewing cosmogram made of five stones. Each
year new stones created the cosmogram, but the old stones were still considered sacred.
Ceremonial actions thus transformed the stones, testifying to the power of human agency and the
stones’ ability to hold sacredness, which changed how people engaged with them. Exploration of
ancient Maya sculptures over their life histories demonstrates that they too demanded special
treatment, suggesting an analogous persistence of sacredness.

We address whether these engravings resemble patterns intended to convey information, or if

[94] Hot spots of diversity or the archaeological nature of human selection
This paper discusses developmental models concerned with areas characterized as having
extremely high plant and animal diversity and as being relevant for conservation. However, none
of these models exposes the fact that these places have been occupied by humans for
millennium. The common argument is that low densities of hunter-gatherers were insignificant in
having an effect on the diversity of species associated to particular territories. It is true that we
cannot talk of landscapes as anthropic modified environments, but we can pay attention to the
specificity of the impact and the long-term effect of human actions on species diversity that
altered the frequencies of specific populations and their consequent ripple effects. Two extreme
scenarios are presented of the long term effect of humans on diversity. These scenarios can be
tested with the archaeological record and can help in the recognition of human selection as a
relevant force in shaping the frequency of variation of species and the structural composition of
the forest in the socially constructed hot spots of the earth.

[52] Geophysical Investigations of Late Prehistoric Monongahela Sites in the Conemaugh
Blacklick Watershed
As part of the IUP Late Prehistoric project, several sites were investigated through geophysical
methods. The surveys were conducted using ground penetrating radar, magnetometry, electrical
resistivity, and conductivity instruments. The goal of the project was to compare the effectiveness
of different methods for investigating internal site structure in both upland and buried floodplain
settings. By combining geophysical surveys with excavation data, we attempted to identify certain
types of features including stockade trenches and storage pits. While in some cases, the results
were ambiguous, the combination of multiple approaches did successfully identify a number of
anomalies in each site.

[53] Variability in Thermal and Compositional Properties of Poverty Point Objects
One of the most abundant classes of artifacts present in the Late Archaic deposit of Poverty
Point, Louisiana is the shaped- and fired- clay “Poverty Point Object” (PPOs). Despite their
ubiquity in Late Archaic deposits up and down the Mississippi river valley, our knowledge of their
functional variability is relatively limited to anecdotal accounts related to cooking. Here, we
explore variability in performance of thermal properties of varying shapes and composition of
PPOs using Differential Thermal Analysis and Thermogavimetric Analysis (TGA).

[10] Household Organization and Differentiation at Cerro Prieto, A Hohokam Cerros de
Trincheras
The transition from the Hohokam Preclassic to Early Classic (ca. AD 1150) in the Tucson Basin is
characterized by large scale population movements and the appearance of specialized site types
including platform mound settlements and cerros de trincheras. Cerros de trincheras are large
villages constructed on low volcanic hills. Platform mounds have been extensively investigated
and provide the basis for interpretations of socio-political organization during this time period.
Results from survey work at a cerros de trincheras are contrasted to these models. Important
distinctions are noted in organizational patterns and the degree of inequality evidenced at the
household level.

[74] Accidental Alloying and the Early Bronze Age of the Eastern Carpathian Basin
Discussions of Early Bronze Age metalwork have often interpreted the use of copper alloys as
intentional. However, recent work with copper ores from the Eastern Carpathians has
demonstrated that some deposits contain significant quantities of arsenic or tin. These ores would
produce a natural alloy when smelted. A local tin source in the Eastern Carpathinans has
important implications for the reconstruction of exchange networks and technological change.
Given the low arsenic and tin contents of most Early Bronze Age metal artifacts, an unintentional
model for early alloying may be more realistic. Differences between metals would have been
readily observable to early smiths and may have provided the impetus towards the development
of intentional alloying.

[102] Lithic Tool Production and Exchange at Moxviquil, Chiapas, Mexico.
During the Late Classic and Early Postclassic periods, residents of the small hilltop site of
Moxviquil developed a highly distinctive lithic industry. New analyses performed on the collection
housed at the Museo Na Bolom suggest that lithic tool production at Moxviquil was centered
around two distinctive sub-industries: the production of chert projectile points and blades from
predominantly local chert sources, and the production of obsidian blades from imported obsidian
prismatic blade cores. This suggests that through the production of lithic tools at Moxviquil, its
residents became important participants in local, regional, and interregional trade networks.

[113] Geographies of Power: Neo-Assyrian Imperialism in Theoretical Perspective
This paper combines archaeological and textual data from the Mesopotamian Iron Age in order to
reconstruct the mechanics of Assyrian expansion into southeastern Anatolia between 1000 and
600 B.C. I argue that Assyrian imperial expansion was not a process of conquering contiguous
areas, creating an empire in which clear lines could be drawn between regions under Assyrian
control and those that were not. Instead, the process of Assyrian imperialism was one in which
“islands” of territorial control were planted in peripheral zones. These islands were linked to the
imperial core by a network of communication and transportation corridors forming an empire
made up of provinces in which the Assyrians held complete territorial control, vassal states in
which the Assyrians held varying degrees of indirect control, and buffer states and zones where
the Assyrians had no control.

In the ghost town of Hermosa, one focus of investigations was the old hotel-the only original
building remaining. To learn more about Hermosa's former citizens, we surveyed a dump site
east of the hotel using different methods, including metal detecting and shovel testing. Metal
detecting yielded many artifacts because its frequency either detects metal substances or it does
not. On the other hand, shovel testing, while systematically sampling the hidden universe, relies
to some extent on serendipity in locating artifacts, which are often only found in screening. This
poster compares and contrasts the effectiveness of metal detecting versus shovel pit testing.

[143] LA-ICP-MS on Ceramic Incrustation Indicates Long-Term Cultural Continuity in the

One of the hottest debates in European prehistory centers on whether so-called Kurgan groups
migrated into the Carpathian Basin from the south Russian Steppes sometime before the
beginning of the Bronze Age. Our results of LA-ICP-MS on samples of white incrustation that was
used to decorate Copper Age vessels indicate that crushed bone, not snail shell, was used to
create the decorative paste. A recent study of incrusted pottery from the Bronze Age in
Transdanubia also identified the use of crushed bone in the creation of the paste, suggesting
continuity in ceramic traditions before and after the Kurgan ‘invasion.’

[39] South Asian Contributions to Animal Domestication and Pastoralism: Bones, Genes, and
Archaeology
Archaeological, zoorchaeological, and genetic research shows that South Asia was a significant
player in bovid domestication and development of pastoralism. This paper contextualizes these
processes in northwestern South Asia from early Holocene into second millennium calBC. Recent
mtDNA analysis of modern cattle, water buffalo, goat, and sheep indicate that wild forms of this
region contributed in differing degrees to the domestic genomes. Faunal evidence supports these
indications and suggests multiple domestication events for cattle and water buffalo in South Asia.
The spread of these domestic forms into China underlines the importance of South Asia in the
development of pastoral practices.

Carbon and oxygen isotope assays of cattle and caprine teeth from two 18th-century Spanish

becoming increasingly consistent in cemeteries across the plain. The formalization of burial
treatment appears consistent with social homogenization from the Tisza-Herpály-Csoszhalom

In recent years, archaeologists have replaced static concepts of ethnic groups as archaeological
cultures with more nuanced perspectives on the extremely fluid and situational nature of ethnic
identities. Debates over the specific relationships among culture, interaction, ethnicity, and
material culture, however, suggest that archaeologists are still struggling with how ethnic
identities can fluctuate while maintaining certain regularities. Using examples from the U.S.

social scales developed by political identity theorists provide new insights into the processes
involved in the development of regional scales of social organization.

and Methodological Implications for Pottery Analyses and Interpretations
The mineralogical identification of pottery temper/aplastics is fundamental for providing accurate
insight into the past. Consequently, errors identifying pottery aplastics can adversely influence
interpretations of prehistoric behavior regardless of a researcher’s theoretical orientation. The
results of a petrographic analysis of late Middle Woodland (ca. A.D. 200-900) pottery from the
Delaware Valley and coastal New Jersey suggest that 1) macroscopic methods of aplastic
identification are in some cases inadequate; and 2) the lack of an explicit theoretical program

between sedentary and semi-sedentary/mobile pottery producers confounds interpretations of

such themes as winged serpents, crested birds, raptors, center symbols and bands, and trophies.
While the style is found on engraved and incised pottery, stone discs, stone pendants, and
copper gorgets, this study focuses on the engraved pottery. It is possible to create a seriation
based on the 147 whole vessels excavated in the first half of the 20th century as well as sherds
with dated contexts from more recent excavations. Preliminary analyses show that the stylistic
diversity of Hemphill-style engraved pottery changes through time.

[15] Histories of Violence: Fracture Patterns in the Sacrificial Victims from Plazas 3A and 3C,
Huaca de la Luna
As this symposium demonstrates, the subject of Moche warfare remains one of great interest.
One area of evidence that has, heretofore, been underutilized in the study of Moche warfare is
analysis of the fracture patterns in the skeletons of the Moche themselves. To examine the role of
interpersonal violence in the lives of Moche individuals, an analysis of pattern of bone fractures
was undertaken for the sacrificial victims from Huaca de la Luna. This analysis revealed that
interpersonal violence was indeed a factor in the lives of several sacrificed individuals, both at the
time of their death and before.

[34] Trends in Site Distributions at Interfaces between Mountains and Basins and Cultures on the
Northeast Colorado Plateau
As the design and holdings of digital databases improve, so does capability for robust wide-area
analysis of archaeological site distribution. Using regional databases and recent field survey
results from vast northeast Colorado Plateau areas and bordering mountain and interior basin
interfaces, we have been able to better consider occupations and affiliations through material
culture and within cultural chronologies in Colorado's Piceance Basin. Our presentation explores
trends within persisting, or "late," Archaic hunting traditions where they overlap with Formative
horticulture among diverse groups within and through time, from ancestral Ute and Fremont to
influences from Southwestern Puebloan and Great Plains cultures.

[189] Intrasite Geoarchaeological Bias in Demographic Estimates for Adobe Pueblos
Seriation of surface ceramics is a common technique for unraveling demographic histories of
prehistoric Puebloan sites in the Southwestern U.S. However, site formation processes within
these sites exert a systematic bias in demographic estimates of founding populations. When
repeated across multiple sites, it biases our understanding of the process of aggregation at the

[10] Pilgrimage to Cerro de Moctezuma, Chihuahua, Mexico
The Casas Grandes ritual landscape encompassed a vast area with constructed and conceptual
points of reference. Nested squarely within that landscape was Cerro de Moctezuma, a hill
settlement to which people from the surrounding valleys journeyed and convened for religious
observances. Trails to the hill served to orient a sense of community and purpose along the
journey and foreground events both at Cerro de Moctezuma and at home, while architecture,
defined social spaces, and the summit ritual precinct contextualized those events. Original and
comparative data are used to support the claim that Cerro de Moctezuma was a pilgrimage

[14] The Archaeology of Catawba Itinerancy
Between 1760 and the 1820s, Catawba Indians in South Carolina leased reservation land to
Anglo-American settlers and worked as itinerant potters and slave catchers, traveling seasonally
from their backcountry home to the seaboard. This paper provides anthropological analysis on
this phenomenon, examining the economics of itinerancy; the Catawba's relationships with their
host society, especially their use of patron-client relationships to maintain their land base; and the
“adaptive” aspects of their itinerant identity. Archaeological perspectives on Catawba itinerancy
include the impact of itinerancy on architecture and site construction, diet, and material culture,
particularly material remains related to mobility and identity construction.

Particle Induced X-ray Emission Spectroscopy (PIXE) was used to analyze Mesa Verde Black-

first phase of a pilot project to analyze the composition of both slip and paint from 26 bowls. Using
K-means cluster analysis and tertiary plots, we identified at least two, possibly three, slip recipes
and a greater variation in paint recipes than apparent in the slips. We anticipate performing
additional PIXE analysis on these sherds to improve our results by taking multiple shots to

Over the last two decades, estimates of the number of people living in Chaco Canyon as a whole

[161] Cooperation and Competition Among Late Woodland Households at Kolomoki (9ER1)
Recent excavations at Kolomoki (9ER1), in the Chattahoochee River Valley of southwestern
Georgia, reveal fundamental changes in the households over the course of the Late Woodland
period, between approximately 600 and 800 A.D. In the early Late Woodland, houses were small
and included minimal storage. Ceramic assemblages show limited diversity and few non-local
types. In the later Late Woodland, these trends were reversed; houses became larger, storage
facilities increased in size and abundance, and the ceramic assemblages became more diverse. I
relate these changes to a breakdown of social institutions that encouraged cooperation among
households.

economic Status
The availability of written records pertaining to households in late-19th and early-20th century
Tucson, Arizona, allows for historical modelling of their socio-economic status. However, these
models should augment, rather than replace, models based on material culture. To develop a
greater understanding of these households, the results of an archivally-based historical model
were compared to three archaeological models. The latter were based on materials collected
from privy contexts during excavations for the Joint Courts Complex project. The comparison
allows for an assessment of the individual models and an examination of socio-economic status
in a late 19th- and early 20th-century Tucson community.

[167] Landscape Changes in the Neolithic of the Russian Far East: Natural, Cultural, and Ritual
One of the principle peculiarities of the Holocene archaeological cultures in the Maritime Region
is their high dependence on the climatic and landscape changes which took place during last 11
000 years. It may be traced by the permanent changes of archaeological cultures within periods
of climatic rhythms’ shifts. The comparison of climatic conditions and cultural dynamics in early
and Middle Holocene points on direct influence of nature processes (landscape transformation,
changes in faunal and floral assemblages connected with the fluctuations of the sea level and
temperature-humidity conditions) on the change of archaeological cultures in the region.

[129] Tracing a Post-Pleistocene “Broad-Spectrum Revolution” on the California Coast
An expansive spatio-temporal approach is used to explore coarse-grained variations in
exploitation of faunal resources at coastal and pericoastal sites along 500 miles of the Central
and Southern California coast with occupations spanning nearly 10,000 years. Allometrically
estimated faunal biomass and specimen frequencies are arrayed in chronological sequences of
abundance indices to develop long-term, region-wide patterns of resource usage. Unexpectedly,
and contrary to narrower, shorter-term archaeological findings, consumption of all classes of
animal flesh appears to have declined markedly over time throughout the coastal region even
though populations grew and societies became more complex. This pattern is consistent with
pervasive adoption of a more carbohydrate-focused diet incorporating non-faunal resources
increasingly available in the emergent Holocene and the more southern latitudes. A long-term
Pleistocene-to-Holocene adaptive “revolution” by coastal populations is suggested.

associated regulations, Executive Order (EO) 13175, Department of Defense (DoD) Native
American Policy are key examples; however, implementation of consultation is often trickier then
these documents make it sound. Cultural Resource Managers, who are often tasked with being
the tribal liaison, look at the policies and suggested ways to comply and end up sending letters
with an occasional phone call to follow up on the timeliness of receiving a response from the
tribes. Organizing even an annual meeting to address upcoming projects and proposed activities
within the realm of the CRM is considered a challenge and seemingly overwhelming task. Yet
such meetings are an important way to address the intent of these consultation requirements: to
build relationships. Building on individual relationships and the realization that tribal areas of
interest cross state borders, Army National Guard states Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi have
organized successful multi-state and tribal meetings which have promoted, endorsed and
enhanced relationships between all participants: tribal and Guard. This presentation discusses
the challenges of organizing such a meeting and the benefits for the tribes and organizations
involved.

hammerstones used to shape them. Statistical analyses of over 1600 features are quantifying
details of the spatial structure and organization of ground stone implement manufacturing in the
Lower Colorado River valley. Data from contiguous block surveys indicates that specific raw
materials were the focus of metate and hammerstone manufacturing within the site, with
prospecting for siliceous toolstone an important secondary activity.

[175] Geoarchaeology and Micromorphology of the Long Term Hohokam Irrigation System
In semi-desert environments, agricultural communities which are dependent upon irrigation
systems must contend with environmental constraints and impact on land use. By studying
irrigation canal infillings from a geoarchaeological/micromorphological approach, it is possible to
understand the interaction between hydrosystems (through an analysis of canal sediments that
register secondary information on fluvial dynamics) and agrosystems (by focusing upon the
anthropic origin of canals). The research presented in this poster outlines a recent study in which
we have used micromorphological studies of Hohokam irrigation canals along the Lower Salt
River Valley in Arizona to correlate their paleoecological signatures to the archaeological record.

[164] Mesa Verde Style Mugs: An Analysis of Domestic and Ritual Functions
Mesa Verde Style Mugs have fascinated Southwestern archaeologists for over a century, yet little
research focuses on this uncommon vessel form. Mugs appear between A.D. 1100 and 1300. To
determine functions of mugs several lines of evidence were examined. Depositional contexts
were investigated at nine Northern San Juan sites. Use-wear patterns were examined using
museum collections. The distribution of mugs across the Southwest was also considered.
Although mugs have previously been characterized as primarily ritual in function, this study
suggests that mugs likely functioned in both domestic and ritual arenas of the Ancestral Puebloan
people.

[131] Archaeologists as Applied Anthropologists
A library of books praising community–based archaeology is now available, but although
collaboration with government agencies and multinational corporations is common, archaeology
has not benefitted from applied anthropological research on corporate culture. Archaeologists
consistently fail to see themselves as change agents in such contexts. In order to resist the
inclination for such hybrid programs to devolve into artifact collecting or a reification of corporate
values, archaeologists need training in applied anthropology to be able to negotiate not only with
indigenous communities, but also with multinational corporations, government agencies and even
military organizations.

[43] The Archaeology of Death and Funerals in Nineteenth Century Tucson
Mortuary practices are an increasingly popular topic of study in recent years with focus on the
Victorian movement toward the "Beautification of Death" in which elaborate, deeply mournful
displays of grief and memorializing the dead were essential. In Tucson, however, when the
transcontinental railroad had yet to forge its way into the landscape, and eastern settlers were still
relatively few, the material culture of mourning and burial was mostly unchanged from practices
brought by the priests of the Spanish missionary period. In this paper, we discuss funerary
artifacts with respect to these merging traditions, memory and placement in the cemetery.

There is a promising relationship between evolutionary grounded costly signaling theory and
understanding lithic technological systems. Past approaches range from interpreting human
behavior through lithic assemblages to examining socially embedded information and costly
displays that the rocks themselves carry. This paper highlights the potentials and pitfalls of
studying costly signaling, conspicuous consumption, and social information exchange within lithic

technological systems, it is vital that we incorporate methodologically sound models and
archaeologically testable cases.

Detailed petrographic analysis of plain, undecorated native sherds from sites in the Anza-Borrego
Desert State Park, San Diego County, is providing new insights into a forgotten ceramic tradition
that once covered much of southern California. By examining these innocuous artefacts at a
microscopic level, it has been possible to reconstruct numerous key aspects of potters'
technological choices, including paste preparation, forming and firing. The identification of
geographically-restricted ceramic compositions characterized by specific combinations of raw
materials and manufacturing technology provides vital evidence for the craft practises and cultural

Catherines Island, GA
Hard clams form alternating light and dark shell growth increments which record an organism’s
life and environmental history. For nearly forty years sclerochronologists have been playing back
shell recordings made in the waters around St. Catherines Island. These recordings start in the
late Archaic and help to address two enduring questions: 1) when in the annual cycle did people
use a given site; and, (2) is there evidence for anthropogenic change? Evidence for intensive,
year-round use of St. Catherines Island hard clams is examined with a robust record for
zooarchaeological assemblages from the Georgia Bight.

Border War Archaeology
Archaeological research in Bates County, Missouri is adding much to our understanding of socio-
economic responses to violence. Relentless partisan warfare in the run-up to the Civil War
culminated in Quantrill’s raid on Lawrence, Kansas in 1863. Union General Ewing then issued
General Order No. 11, depopulating and destroying private property in four counties. Within one
decade, the area went from booming frontier to desolate wasteland. A primary challenge is
maintaining chronological control in such short-term occupation sites. An analysis of window
glass thickness at the site is proving to be an effective tool in resolving these chronological
challenges.

GIS least-cost path modeling is a critical component of our interdisciplinary investigations of
related Paleoindian sites in southern Peru. The Alca source, Peru’s largest highland obsidian
deposit, was first used by Paleoindian foragers ~13,000 years ago at the coastal site Quebrada
Jaguay. Incorporating data from mapping and geochemical characterization of toolstone source
deposits, resource modeling, and local paleoenvironmental research, we have defined a
predictive least-cost corridor linking Quebrada Jaguay with resources in interior ecozones. Initial
investigations of the corridor have successfully identified contemporary Paleoindian sites in the
highlands, highlighting the usefulness of least-cost path modeling when constrained by
paleogeographic data.

[99] Results of Systematic Significance Assessment Applied in a Large Survey Project
CRM survey projects usually require assessment of site significance, often determined
unsystematically or with undue weight given to site integrity. Work on a 31,000 acre survey in
central Mississippi allowed significance determinations to incorporate variability among
occupations, measured using five dimensions: temporal placement and duration, measured using
diagnostics; occupation intensity, measured using soil chemistry; and artifact class richness and
evenness. Integrity was evaluated separately for each group of classified occupations, based on
preservation of soils and intact deposits. This system, augmented by Choctaw cultural concerns,
is applied to assemblages from ca. 400 sites to make recommendations on further work.

Madagascar
Warriors in Madagascar engaged in dance to prepare for battle, taunt enemies, and celebrate
victory. But it was also customary for females to dance and sing non-stop in villages to sustain
the actions of the warriors while in battle. Forceful poetic taunting of the enemy is to be expected
also in primarily oral societies. Yet, in highland Madagascar troops from the same side were
divided into two competing groups, and sanctioned poetic taunting between the groups spurred
troops into battle. This contribution focuses on the poetically and physically (e)motivated bodies

[49] The Bow and Arrow and Changes in Debitage Assemblages
Changes in flintknapping technologies and debitage assemblages from pre-ceramic to ceramic

technology, and have been attributed to reduced mobility. Some of the assumptions underlying

This study examines the growth and development of the medieval walled city of Cork, Ireland,

c. 900 when the Vikings settled the area; the late-12th/mid-13th century when sources reference
the building of the city walls, and c. 1500 before the dismantling of the city walls. The main
questions to be answered are: what priorities influence the location of settlements, what factors
determine the location of centers within a settlement (with emphasis on location inside and
outside the town walls), and what the data reveal about the society.

[18] A Taphonomic model of Interspecific differential preservation of freshwater mussel remains
(Family Unionidae).
Archaeological mussel remains are often used to study prehistoric environments, but
zooarchaeologists confront taphonomic issues that affect measures of taxonomic richness and
abundance. Remains of thick-shelled species preserve well, but those of thin-shelled species do
not. This raises questions: were some species actually rare? Or are diagenetic processes
responsible for low abundance of remains? Studies suggest fragmentation from sedimentary
compaction affects shells that are spherical in shape less, increasing preservation. We examine
sphericity [(bc/a2)0.33] for twelve species from North Texas to determine if it influences
preservation. Results suggest that preservation of shellfish remains are explained by density and
sphericity.

Two concentrations of petroglyphs were recorded during an archaeological study on the western

Both sites were documented in detail and appear to be temporally and functionally interrelated.
To establish a temporal context, a new direct dating technique, developed by researchers at
Arizona State University, was employed. This technique measures the accumulation of silica
glaze within subsurface micropores of the basalt in which the petroglyphs have been created. It
was also possible, using Accelerator Mass Spectrometry to directly date oxalates trapped under
the silica glaze. An analysis of the petroglyphs in light of ethnohistoric data, information on
symbolic importance, and the Hawaiian system of gestural symbolism, provides a foundation for
interpretation.

Together, these phenomena point to the development of transegalitarian social organization and
possible “aggrandizers” within local societies.

[100] Soil Resources of the Ancient Maya at Tecolote in the Usumacinta River Basin
The Usumacinta river basin was once home to a flourishing Maya population. For centuries
leading up to that civilization’s collapse (in the 8th to 9th centuries AD), two major rival
kingdoms—Yaxchilán and Piedras Negras—competed for the resources of this basin. The site of
Tecolote is thought to lie near the ancient border between these two kingdoms, making the site
and the area surrounding it of significant interest in understanding the land-use patterns and
agricultural production of the ancient inhabitants. . To evaluate the extent of ancient maize (Zea
mays) agriculture in the Tecolote area, we examined the stable carbon isotope ratios within soil
profiles. Maize, a C4 photosynthetic plant is less discriminatory toward the heavier 13C isotope
than the C3 trees and vines that have dominated the forest for the past 1200 years. Residues left
by maize cultivation leave a distinct stable carbon isotope ratio signature in soil organic matter
that persists for many centuries. Soil profiles from a variety of landforms and at slope positions
were characterized, classified, and 12C/ 13C ratios were determined.

Americans at Santa Catalina de Guale did not embrace Spanish dietary practices and Spanish
foodways were strongly influenced by Native American traditions. These observations diverge
from long-held expectations for the influence of colonialism on indigenous and immigrant diets,

of this transition tend to focus on those areas most affected by the phenomenon: Jordan and
Israel. The current study uses settlement data from both the southern and northern Levant to
describe a more expansive, if different, picture of resettlement processes that crosscuts modern

[15] When the Agreement is Over: Conflict in Late Transitional Period at San Jose de Moro,
Jequetepeque Valley, Peru
During the what has been called the Late Transitional Period, following the Moche collapse at
San Jose de Moro,, Cajamarca ceramics gradually became the most prominent mortuary offering
in elite burials. However, at the end of this period, elite tombs were systematically destroyed and
desecrated, apparently at the hands of the Lambayeque state. This event presents us with one of
the clearest signs of cultural clash in the Peruvian north coast. In this paper we discuss the nature
of the presence of foreign styles at San Jose de Moro, the configuration of Late Transitional
cemeteries, the strategies for legitimating territory, and group identity.

[83] Oxygen Isotopes from Maya Archaeological Deer Remains: Experiments in Tracing Drought
using Bones and Teeth
In the tropics, the oxygen isotopic composition (Î´18O) of leaf water is strongly related to

[53] A Reevaluation of Early Commercial Food Production in Eastern Iowa
In 1978, archaeological excavations at the Plum Grove Historic Farm site (located in Iowa City,
Iowa) uncovered an extensive bone bed. The bone bed, deposited in the late 19th century,
contained the remains of numerous cattle, sheep and pigs. Previous analyses have shown that
deposition occurred over a brief time period, indicating that this event was likely not for a single
family’s subsistence. This project (which included renewed excavations in 2008) investigates the
possible market economy associated with these remains in attempts to evaluate the ways in
which Euro-American settlers made a living in the late 19th century.

[48] Refuse or Ritual? An Examination of the Problematic Deposit of Artifacts in the Tomb Fill of
Burial 39, El Peru-Waka, Guatemala
If artifacts often characterized as refuse are discovered in indisputably ritualized settings, do they
constitute mundane trash? This on-going conundrum will be examined through the context of the
ancient reentry of a Classic-period Maya ruler’s tomb at El Peru-Waka’. Located in one of the
site’s largest temple-pyramids, the chamber was in-filled with vault stones and soil containing
several artifact classes which could arguably be components of middens. These artifacts may,
however, be remnants of activities directly related to reentry. Ultimately, can we know the
difference? The Burial 39 case study will be compared and contrasted with data from other
reentered Maya burials.

[40] Studying Social Interaction at the Ancient Maya Site of Copán, Honduras: A Least-Cost
Approach to Configurational Analysis
At the ancient Maya city of Copán, Honduras the distribution and arrangement of elite and
commoner households were not the result of haphazard processes. Instead, distinctly Maya
social practices influenced where people of particular social classes built their homes, how they
built them, and who their neighbors were. To better understand how different groups interacted, a
Geographic Information System was developed to carry out a form of configurational analysis that
employed least-cost paths. Data from both the natural and built environments were integrated to
create an Urban Digital Elevation Model to model the city’s layout and study potential social

[94] Animal Invasion: Ancient Animal Translocations and Hunter-Gatherers on the California
Channel Islands
Never connected to the adjacent mainland during the Quaternary, the California Channel Islands
contain an impoverished terrestrial fauna, consisting primarily of the island fox, the island spotted
skunk, a squirrel, mice, and a few reptiles/amphibians. How and when most of these animals
colonized the Channel Islands remains unclear, with researchers generally speculating on a
natural, human-assisted, or combined dispersal. Recent research suggests that Native
Americans probably introduced many of these animals during the Holocene, including the island
fox—the largest terrestrial predator on the islands. These data demonstrate the importance of
ancient hunter-gatherers in shaping Channel Island ecosystems.

[49] Making Tool-Making Tools: A Comparative Technological Analysis of Burin and Burin-Like
Tool Production in the Eastern North American Arctic
Spalled burins and burin-like tools (BLTs) are functional analogues, useful as both gravers and
planes for working hard organics. Grinding becomes more common on burins throughout the Pre-
Dorset period and ultimately supplants burination as the primary means of working-edge
rejuvenation. Burins are replaced in the subsequent Dorset period by fully-ground BLTs. This
analysis of working-surface morphologies demonstrates that BLTs have significantly greater
rejuvenation and edge-maintenance potential than do spalled burins. The increased production
costs accompanying grinding in this context are off-set by a minimization of material waste,
flexibility in rejuvenation processes, and an increase in suitable raw material types.

potential travel routes between sites and sources. The results indicate that the least cost paths do
not correspond to the straight-line measurements. Ultimately, this technique may help to identify
new archaeological sites or chert sources situated along these potential routes.

main purpose of this paper is to explore the social composition over time in smaller social units
(households) and its link to the formation of communities, both used to contribute to our
knowledge about demographic changes and social interaction. Three trajectories of chiefdom
development were considered: the Muisca (Colombia), the Alto Magdalena (Colombia), and the
Marajoara (Brazil). Two aspects made up the nature of the social composition, the number of
members per social unit, and its relation to possible structure units.

[189] Compromise at Home: Behavioral Ecology and Gendered Dialogs in Autonomous
Households
In mixed economy hunter-gatherer-gardener societies, the increasing economic importance of
women’s labor may have been parleyed into a greater role in decision-making within autonomous
households. Decisions regarding land use strategies, mobility, economy, and technology are fluid
and constantly renegotiated between male and female decision-makers. In this paper, we explore
the implications of male and female provisioning goals derived from Human Behavioral Ecology
for understanding temporal and spatial variation in the archaeological record of the Mogollon
Pithouse Period (AD 200-1000) and protohistoric Northern Plains Village (AD 1400-1800)
societies.

[47] The Potential of Southern Baja California in the Peopling of the Americas
As the Ice Age ended this region on the coastal route from the Bering Straits had a unique
resource mix: sun and warm temperatures, higher rainfall than today, deep-water fisheries,
lagoons, rugged calcareous and volcanic terrain, and diverse vegetation. Like some Patagonians,
Southern Baja indigenous groups have been linked genetically with Paleoarchaic populations.
Compelling traces of a distinctive, early archaeological occupation merit further investigation.
Only a few have been sampled, but one site dates to the beginning of the Holocene. Smoky
caves and black-sand middens lie near beaches, lagoons, and gravely floodplains. In the
middens are fishbone, shells, carbonized plants, hammerstones, large turtle-back scrapers, and
triangular, stemmed projectile point fragments. A half-hour inland, there are extensive lithic

[130] Bronze Age Obsidian Procurement in Peçica Santul Mare, Romania
Obsidian artifacts can provide unique insight into an array of anthropological questions, such as
subsistence and trade, but studies of Bronze Age communities have traditionally focused on the
circulation of metals and ceramics. This study compliments such analyses by examining obsidian
procurement patterns of the Maros Culture. Obsidian artifacts from Peçica ªanþul Mare, a Middle
Age Maros Culture site in Western Romania, are analyzed by non-destructive X-ray fluorescence
and neutron activation analysis in order to determine their original source. Chemical
characterizations of artifacts are compared to previous obsidian data from the region to elucidate
procurement patterns of the Maros Culture.

[16] The Development of Pastoral Tribes in the Desert: a Case Study from the Negev
The diffusion of the domestic goats into Neolithic desert hunter-gatherer societies of the southern
Levant engendered fundamental changes in subsistence, social organization, and ideology,
beginning in the 7th millennium BC. These changes ultimately crystallized in a package including
increased territoriality, elaborate cult and cosmology, and larger and hierarchical social units - the
rise of desert tribes. In some contrast with the earlier agricultural revolution in the settled regions
of the Near East, the adoption of herding precedes the social/ideological developments by
roughly 500 years, suggesting that changes in social fabric were adaptations to the demands of
the new subsistence system.

For more than 30 years, Africanist archaeologists have debated the extent of hunter-gatherer,
pastoralist and agriculturalist interactions across the Kalahari desert in the Early and Late Iron
Age periods (100 - 1600 CE). This is the first large-scale archaeological and ethnographic project
to investigate the technological, social, political and economic implications of the movement of
people in precolonial Botswana. We analyzed over 300 archaeological and ethnographic
potsherds, and compared them to over 75 clay samples. The associations between these groups
were long-term, as evidenced by the ceramic characterization, and likely were driven by access
to natural resources.

[11] Investigation of a modern irrigation system under archaeological considerations
Archaeological studies on ancient irrigation are mainly based on the interpretation of settlement
patterns and satellite imagery. Due to insufficient data, an understanding of how ancient irrigation
systems were designed beyond the primary canals is still lacking. Little ethnographic data are
available to inform archaeological interpretations. This study investigates how factors like
demography, patterns of landownership and agricultural and economic conditions impact the
spatial organization of the irrigation system studied by Poyck in the 1960s and its associated
settlement system. The result of this study shall inform future archaeological research on
Mesopotamian irrigation.

We draw on geoarchaeological and pedological research in the Palmarejo Valley of northwestern
Honduras to explore the ways in which historical and emerging human impacts to soilscapes
influence modern land use practices. This work uses physical and chemical analyses of soils and

occupation of the area all the way up to the present. We are interested to learn whether the
prehispanic abandonment of this region was associated with human-induced soil erosion and the
extent to which such processes altered the soilscape for succeeding generations of farmers.

[141] Corpses and Ghosts: The African Burial Ground
The bodies of the dead are especially significant actors and their treatment is encompassed
within aspects of iconoclash, handled with respect or trangressed and degraded at differing times
in their trajectory. As their reality fades their power may increase. The African Burial Ground in
lower Manhattan, NYC is an exemplar of such conflicting representations. In the 18th c. dead
Africans were buried carefully; in the 19th c the cemetery was built over, forgotten and
disrespected. Late in the 20th c, these bodies were relocated and had become ghosts, subjected
to wildly divergent attitudes and behaviors by a Federal agency, the African-American
community/communities and archaeologists.

[16] Consolidation and Fragmentation of Nomadic Political Landscapes: Archaeological Evidence
from Inner Asia
A key index for understanding the development of political landscapes is the extension of territory
under the control of political units. This index is inherently difficult to ascertain in the case of
Nomadic societies, largely due to the fragmentary or “non-uniform” nature of their political
institutions. This paper traces the fluctuation of territorial expansion from the middle Bronze Age
to the early Iron Age in the Semirech’ye region of southeastern Kazakhstan, specifically in the
newly surveyed Ush-Kara desert region, outlining the political economy and chronology
associated with dynamic structures of social and political organization among mobile pastoralists
of Inner Asia.

[189] The Salt Trade in the Prehistoric American Southwest
Salt is a biological necessity of human life. In prehistoric times, the lack of salt could drastically
affect the health of entire populations. Trade in salt was very important, but very difficult to see in
the archaeological record. The areas that didn’t have salt needed it and the areas had the salt
had a lucrative trade source. Most salt can be obtained by collecting it from natural deposits;
however, the location on salt flats of large-shallow ceramic vessels in the American Southwest
suggests that salt was purposely being produced, and through impurities, can be traced along the
invisible trade routes.

the politization of communities and development of regional identities on the coast, and discuss
this evidence in light of my on-going work at the site of Dos Mangas.

As shamanism is a concept used cross-culturally, frequently applied also in rock art studies, it is
interesting and crucial to look at how it is understood in “terra mater” of shamanism and what are
the relationships between shamanism and rock art in Siberia. Confronting different models of
shamanism the paper looks at this phenomenon from the perspective of local cultural tradition,
considering the ways of identifying shamanic iconography in historic and prehistoric rock art in
Siberia (basing on recent research done in south Siberia, Altai and Minusinsk Basin). Besides
evident cultural specifics, surprising interpretative parallels with metaphoric model, first conceived
in Africa and then developed in America, are presented.

Iconography
Conflict and negotiation between coastal and upper valley/highland communities in the Peruvian
north coast characterizes the process of state formation and the construction of a "Moche
identity". New "Moche" elites manipulated visual media and ritual performance creating an
ideological discourse where interethnic conflict and negotiation were not only expressed through
"warfare," "ritual battle" and supernatural confrontation scenes in ceramic vessels, murals and
other supports, but also inscribed and enacted in elite burials and public rituals in temples. This
paper presents an iconographic analysis of Moche art as a complementary source of information
for archaeological interpretations of scenarios of social interaction.

The tradition of building architecture on a monumental scale is one of the aspects that set

tradition in the Central Lowlands, and demonstrates that the meaning of monumental architecture
transcended the power of single structures. Entire groups, formally designed in the Middle and
Late Preclassic periods, designated site areas for different uses in ways that had long-term
effects throughout San Bartolo’s Late Classic reoccupation. Beyond size, monumental
architecture functioned as the very meaning of the word monument—a place for people to share

[165] The Rise and Fall—and Rise and Fall—of Shell-Ring and Shell-Mound Architecture in the
Southeast U.S.
Shell rings were built by at least eight distinctive cultures along southeastern U.S. coasts between
4600 and 3500 BP. Around 3800 BP, shell ring construction began winding down, disappearing
with other large-scale shell mounding within a few centuries. When large-scale shell mounding
reemerged two millennia later, mounds had changed from simple refuse piles and ring
monuments to a wider variety of forms with varied functions (e.g., infrastructural, sepulchral, and
hierarchal). Changes in sea-level rise seem to have universally been a major catalyst for this
cycling in mound construction, although the forms and functions mounds took were linked to local
social trajectories.

Depictions of ancient life, particularly in popular literature, have a profound effect on the public

archaeological interpretations of the past be both inclusive and representative. Children were a
significant part of past populations; to overlook them in our analysis is to risk losing much
important information. Reviewing available research, I explore the degree to which children are
accounted for in Northwest Coast archaeological literature — both written and visual

First, the images offer glimpses of ancient environmental features as seen through the artist’s

and Acoustic Mapping
In April 2008, interior and exterior surface features of Painted Indian Cave (41BC1) in Blanco
County, Texas were laser mapped and color photographed; existing sounds were recorded. A
digital, three dimensional, sound-enhanced simulation of the underground environment was
produced. Mapped were complex reverberations of nearby waterfalls in context with solid red
monochrome pictographs of supernaturals, geometrics, and bison. Dated to 770± 50 years BP
(Brock et al. 2006), the art corresponded with the time of the reentry of bison into the Southern
Plains of Texas, during the Late Prehistoric. The investigation was important for several reasons.
Documenting the natural sounds in this undisturbed context aids in our understanding of how
aural phenomena may have influenced and affected ancient site use. The simulated environment
can be virtually visited and studied, protecting the cave’s fragile resources from further damage
and deterioration. The method shows promise in fields of resource analysis, monitoring,
management, ligation, scientific experimentation, and education.

sediments from small Late Neolithic and early Copper Age settlements allows correlation of
chemical signatures with social activities. Data suggest that the size, organization and use of
space within these sites varied during this transitional period. The methodological approach
applied here also demonstrates the relevancy of a “sediments as material culture” perspective, as
the links between human activities and site sediments are as significant as the connections
between behavior and other classes of material culture.

[2] Re-evaluating the Early Postclassic in El Salvador from a Mesoamerican Perspective
The Early Postclassic of southeastern Mesoamerica is poorly understood. Realignments of

chronological realignment of the Early Postclassic site of Cihuatan to the mid-ninth century A.D.
This chronological revision in central El Salvador has repercussions for the entire region,
including the Pacific coast of Guatemala and Copan. Regional patterning in western El Salvador
during this period reflects dramatic depopulation, yet populations clearly maintained wide-ranging

[178] Ethno-history, Oral Tradition, and African Diaspora Archaeology: Community Empowerment
in the Production of History in the African Diaspora
Deciphering ideology of enslaved African peoples throughout the Americas has been the subject
of recent archaeological studies. Two outcomes of these ideological studies have emerged. First,
is the recognition that the interpretation of archaeological material from African Diaspora sites in
the Americas must include significant descendent community involvement and the need to
engage oral data sources. Secondly, it requires collaborative action among researchers from
various disciplines. This paper uses an interdisciplinary approach to interpret archaeological
materials related to spiritual practices of an enslaved African community in Jamaica. It also
explores the rewards and challenges of collaborative research.

[165] How high, how fast, how full: variability in mounded shell ring sites on selected coasts
Extensive and intensive examination of shell ring sites on the lower Atlantic coast has provided
information on both similarities and differences between the rings. Among the similarities are:
height, generally over one meter and sometimes much higher; fill, whole clean shell; and the
construction time--base and top dates are often statistically indistinguishable. These and other
characteristics are compared to mounded shell sites in other countries. Together with
ethnographic information, these data are used to discuss the function of rings in the social
landscape of the lower Atlantic coast.

[72] The Archaeology of a High School Student
Appreciating the thought process of a high school student is similar to deciphering the subtleties
of an archaeological site whose soils display a complex stratigraphy depicting different layers of
understanding, accompanied by of a series of anomalies which require further evaluation. This
paper reviews the development and evaluation of archaeological curricula for high school
students while providing light-hearted insight into the challenges and successes of engaging
students along their “archaeological journey.” A high school archaeology class can be used as an
educational tool to foster a more holistic approach to understanding and appreciating history
while developing students as active participants in the preservation of cultural resources.

[17] The Materialization of Ritual and the Interpretation of Ritual Material at Lake Jackson
Examination of a ceramic assemblage recovered from excavations in Mound 6 at the Lake
Jackson site reveals a distinct set of associated ceramic forms. I argue that these forms
constitute the material expression of a basic pattern of ritual practice shared by the members of
the Lake Jackson society, other Mississippian societies in the Lower Southeast, and the historic
Apalachee descendents of the Lake Jackson people. Using ethnohistorical sources I link this
assemblage to specific ritual practices described in the 17th-century Apalachee ballgame

[42] Moundville as a Ceremonial Ground
Archaeologists often use terms such as "ceremonial center" without considering how they relate
to ethnographic structures. The basic building block of Native polities in the American South was
a social unit the English called a "town." Here we pose the question, was Moundville such a
town? We argue it was not. Rather, we suggest it functioned more like a ceremonial ground, a
place of priestly ritual where people from many towns gathered. Moundville's history may have
been driven by a changing balance of power between priestly officials situated at the center and
town officials in outlying communities.

The archaeological record of pre-Columbian chiefdoms on Marajó Island shows plenty of pottery
sherds of an exquisite female piece of wardrobe: a triangular shaped pubic covering (named
tanga), likely used by elite females during puberty rites. In this paper, we draw comparisons
between archaeological and ethnographic ceramic objects in order to think about these ancient
ceremonies. Also, we examine the iconography of the archaeological tangas in order to infer
about female statuses and their role in social organization, religion and ritual.

[18] Wallace Tank Pueblo: A Pueblo IV Period Village in Eastern Arizona
The cluster of Pueblo IV villages in the Petrified Forest region has long been an enigma for
Southwest archaeologists. Recent mapping and surface collection at Wallace Tank Pueblo
provides new information about settlement size, chronology, and interregional social ties. This
research indicates that Wallace Tank was one of the largest pueblos in eastern Arizona during
the A.D. 1300s and that residents had strong social ties to the Hopi mesas and Silver Creek area.
Comparisons to other late villages suggest that the Petrified Forest cluster may have been a key
social and economic node connecting Pueblo IV villages in eastern Arizona.

[83] Water in the West: Chronology and Collapse of the Classic Maya River Kingdoms
The royal dynasties of the Western Maya kingdoms are enigmatic if the Classic collapse was
triggered by climate change. Environmentally, they are provided with some of the most abundant
surface water and highest annual rainfall in the Maya Lowlands. Historically, the dynasties at
Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan were among the first to fall at the beginning of the 9th century,
while the kingdom of Tonina persisted into the 10th century. This paper explores the natural and
cultural processes underlying the complexities of political collapse in the Western Lowlands, with
a particular focus on the Middle Usumacinta River.

outcomes for each expedition hinged on original motivations, expeditionary logistics, different

[174] Establishing Geographic Ranges for Pleistocene Hunter-Gatherers Using Proton Induced X-
ray Emission (PIXE) Analysis
Sourcing studies play an important role in understanding prehistoric mobility and territoriality. The
ability to create quantifiable criteria that will group chert artifacts and link those groups to natural
chert sources can help establish geographic ranges for Pleistocene hunter-gatherers. However,
the petrogenesis of chert tends to result in relative homogeneity and a dominate silica content –
both of which make chert challenging to source. PIXE, a non-destructive method for analyzing
geochemical composition, demonstrated promising results on chert in two pilot studies. This
research tests PIXE's effectiveness under the less than perfect conditions (e.g., patinas,
weathering, variable sample dimensions) that define archaeology.

[107] Denial of Identity and History in Ethnoarchaeology
Ethnoarchaeologists design projects without fulsome examination of cultural contexts—

betray a lack of understanding for the role that history plays in contemporary identity, how it
informs how people behave vis-à-vis other social groups, and how it enters into negotiating
access to basic resources. There are other troubling issues, foremost among them the silencing
of historical informants by using the now popular concept of “multivocality”, a trope that
homogenizes individual, subaltern testimonies into bland summaries, transforming the
archaeologist into a ventriloquist who usurps historical identities.

[56] Gradual Accumulation or Punctuated Events? The Pace of Mound Construction in Coastal
Southwest Florida
Caloosahatchee mound sites have dotted southwest Florida landscapes for 2,000 years, where
the non-agricultural Calusa chiefdom was the dominant group at the time of Spanish contact. As
symbols of power and authority, mounds reflect the organization of labor to create cultural
landscapes. The use of shell and midden as building materials present challenges to
understanding site construction and chronology. Twenty-five radiocarbon dates from alternating
shell and earthen strata, zooarchaeological analysis and artifact content of one complete mound
profile address the pace and nature of mound construction. These data strongly caution against
radiometric dating of shell for timing site occupation.

[164] 12th Century Resource Use and Settlement Reorganization in the Eastern Mimbres Area
After AD 1130, residents of large Classic Mimbres villages in the eastern Mimbres area dispersed
into scattered hamlets. I investigate the role of changes in resource access in this reorganization.
Access to large mammals does not appear to have changed after 1130; these animals remained
scarce during both periods. Settlement reorganization did change access to different types of
agricultural land, particularly areas with high-permeability soils. Although some aspects of the
12th century reorganization may have been related to resource stress and changes in access,
these shifts do not account for the magnitude of the settlement pattern changes in the area.

Naco Valley, Northwestern Honduras
Sharer and his colleagues have written a richly detailed account of state formation at Copan.
Rulers of the 100km2 Naco valley polity, 120km to the NE, initiated in the 7th century a

considers how foreign notions of rulership interacted with local political forms through the actions
of agents organized within shifting alliances that spanned variable temporal and spatial scales.
The dynamism and instability of the resulting power structure engendered a state very different
from Copan and one whose legacy diverged considerably from that of its prototype.

[114] Structure, "Event", "event", and the Social Totality: Examining a Failed State in
Precolumbian SE Mesoamerica
Structuration theory allows us to look at the organization of culture, but it has been criticized as
too synchronic. The concept of the “Event”— conjunction of processes that together result in
major culture change, that is, alteration of the structure—expands structuration, accounting for
change. The idea of “event” adds detail to the models. Small “events” are quotidian activities that
make up life, both producing and reproducing structure. The conjunction of event, Event, and
structure is used to describe and explain continuities in corporate political forms and the failure of
personalized rule in the Late Classic Naco valley.

were housed in areas with specific support functions. Black soldiers occupied barracks,

[17] From Chiefdom to Tribe: Parallel Mississippian Trajectories
Parallels can be seen between the trajectories of two Middle Mississippian polities: that of
Moundville in central Alabama, and of Angel in southwestern Indiana. For both, Middle
Mississippian chiefdoms were replaced by tribal societies that lacked the more hierarchical
organization of their predecessors. Trends in maize consumption, as reflected in human stable
carbon-isotope ratios, parallel the changes in social organization, with higher maize consumption
associated with more hierarchical social organizations. This association suggests functional
connections between social organization and agricultural intensification that are the
consequences of more proximate linkages between population size, distribution, and organization
for effective maintenance and reproduction.

increased use of C-shaped masonry benches, are thought to mark in-migration that accompanied

The Jomon complex foraging culture in the Japanese archipelago (ca 1,3000-3,000BP) can be
depicted as a long adaptational process to the post-glacial environments. Taking the Kansai
district as an example, this paper addresses that the process can be divided into two stages from
the viewpoint of landscape history: 1) the stage of a "passive-acquired" landscape, in which the
subsistence system was still strongly restricted by regional environments (up to 4,000BP), and 2)
newly introduced technology complex launched large-scale resource exploitation and started

Deity icon, spread rapidly over much of the Peruvian coast around A.D. 1000 forming a horizon.
Various central coast sites, including the famed ceremonial-funerary center of Pachacamac, have
yielded either imported Middle Sicán objects and/or their local imitations. This paper examines
relevant evidence to elucidate the possible mechanism(s) and process of their distribution,
including partnership between the two great ceremonial centers of Sicán and Pachacamac for
acquisition and distribution of ritual items such as Spondylus and aggrandizement of their
prestige and power.

[86] Classic Maya social space: changing patterns of access, spatial segmentation and social
status in the Maya lowlands
This paper seeks to analyse the changing nature of patterns of movement through urban
environments in the Maya area over time, examining the changing morphology of Maya centres
and the concomitant changes in movement through these cities, in particular the points of
articulation between the broader urban fabric and architectural complexes and buildings. This
paper seeks to elucidate some general trends concerning the changing nature of spatial
patterning and movement in Maya cities, and how these changes reflect concurrent changes in
Maya society. This study will be conducted through a combination of architectural, art historical,
and spatial analyses.

[163] Picking up the pieces: nineteenth century archaeological materials from Yucatán in the
American Museum of Natural History
The American Museum of Natural History in New York holds a diverse collection of artefacts from
Yucatán that was assembled throughout the nineteenth century. The stories behind the objects
tell us about the activities of a group of proto-archaeologists and local antiquarians who were
exploring the region in search of pre-Hispanic remains. Using the materials identified in the
Museum, and records from other archival sources, our aim is to reunite the orphaned, de-
contextualized remnants of this early burst of proto-scientific inquiry with present day knowledge,
and to shed light on the obscure history of their transit to the Museum.

[46] Tracking Temporal Contexts: Establishing Site Chronology at Back Creek Village, St.
Catherines Island, GA
Ceramic typology and radiocarbon evidence can provide both period and phase level
chronological controls on the Georgia coast. We can fine tune this sequence by examining
temporally sensitive ceramic attributes such as rim treatments and other decorative elements,
from assemblages recovered in discrete, short-term archaeological deposits. This paper reports
on recent attribute-level ceramic studies of sherds recovered from Back Creek Village, St.
Catherines Island. Coupled with 8 associated radiocarbon dates, the ceramic attributes allows us
to establish a more fine-grained Late Prehistoric chronology for the island.

[80] Geoarchaeology of the Long Swamp Site on the Etowah River
The Long Swamp Site is located on three terraces north of the Etowah River. The T3 is a
Pleistocene surface with a well-developed Bt-horizon and polygonal cracking at depth attributed
to LGM climate. The T2 terrace formed by ~8 ka B.P. with buried soils indicating Late Pleistocene
and Early Holocene periods of landscape stability. The T1 terrace is a Late Holocene landform
bordered by a prehistoric levee. A levee of historic sediment separates the river channel from the
prehistoric deposits. Geochemistry and sedimentology of alluvium and feature matrix is being
used to evaluate site formation processes and differentiate feature characteristics.

[20] Xochitecatl-Cacaxtla
During the Formative period begins the construction of the civic-ceremonial centre that
concentrates all the sites of the Tlaxcala Valley between the Zahuapan and Atoyac rivers. Its
strategic location on the valley is due not only to the exchange routes to the Gulf of Mexico, the
Oaxaca region, the Central High Plateau and the Morelos Valley, but also to the sacred
geography that the use of the ritual space gives. In this paper we analyze the social and
economic organization that characterized this centre from the Formative period until its peak in
the second occupation during the Epiclasic, remarking the activities of specialization and daily life
trying also to situate it in the bordering Puebla region by the comparison of the identified material
culture. The analysis is made using the results of surface remains and excavations in the rural
settlements and the inhabited terraces of the Xochitecatl-Cacaxtla city.

Cultural and temporal linkage between the Basketmaker II sites in the Animas River drainage

been assumed. Early agriculturalists occupied the valleys, tributaries, and adjacent uplands of
these two rivers systems for more than eight centuries. Similarities in architecture, site structure,

evidence that the occupations in these two areas are temporally discrete and may be the result of
regional migrations and changing subsistence systems.

[83] Agricultural Land Use, Deforestation, and Drought Severity
We use a simulation of slash-and-burn maize agriculture in the Maya Lowlands to examine the
relationship between deforestation related to agricultural practice and the hydrologic regime.
Previous work has applied the MM5, WRF, RAMS, and CCSM3 models to study the effect of
broad-scale deforestation on climate (temperature and rainfall) in Mesoamerica. We apply agent-

extents of deforestation. Initial results from the current simulations contribute to an understanding
of how drought is experienced, according to site-specific agricultural practice, intensification
measures, and related deforestation.

[178] Significant Shortcomings in the Use of Ethnographic Data to Interpret Prehistoric
Iconography: A Mimbres Case Study
Iconographic interpretation is a widely applied process for which there are no clear rules, the
interpretations based on unique paradigms, and formalized using ambiguous associative
relationships. To accept this process as valid, it should first be valid in culturally relevant historic
contexts with replicable results. Several Southwestern ethnographic studies indicate that such
diachronic interpretations are unsubstantiable at more specific, often sensational levels and
problematic at general levels. If the ethnographic basis for interpretation is dysfunctional, then the
interpretations of prehistoric iconography will be dysfunctional for Mimbres-Mogollon as well.

This study attempted to determine the provenance of lead used to manufacture selected

competitive events through divine power. Approximately 90 curse tablets and 100 galena ores
were collected from Tunisia for the comparison. A small subset of the 90 curse tablets were
determined by electron microprobe analysis to be tablets most likely constructed of Tunisian lead.
These tablets and the galena samples were analyzed by thermal ionization mass spectrometry to
determine the lead isotope ratios of 208Pb/206Pb, 207Pb/206Pb, and 204Pb/206Pb. Many of the
tablets appear to have been constructed from Tunisian lead, or lead with very similar isotope
patterns. The conclusion is that the Romans were most likely mining galena deposits in Tunisia.

Southwestern archaeologists know that various pathogens and ailments such as anemia affected
past people. A syndemic approach, which is based on the realization that health is a result of the
holistic interaction of human behavior, different diseases, and the natural environment, holds
great potential for the study of health related issues through time. Here we apply a syndemic
approach to identify factors during the Medio period of the Casas Grandes region such as
urbanization, increased reliance on maize agriculture, and the rise of social differentiation that
would have affected the spread of diseases.

[50] Elite Networking and Incipient State Development
Studies in Mesoamerican (epiclassic) and Mediterranean (Greek archaic) archaeology indicate
that elites networking outside their own states can have a destabilizing effect on state formation.
But recent work with Iron Age sites on Crete limits broad applications of this concept. While
Cretan elites were well known for connections to the Near East and Egypt, and numerous
connections between Cretan city-states, these networks were not destabilizing. My research
indicates this active networking could not destabilize the polis, because elites did not sufficiently
develop extrapolital identities. Results are applied to dual processualism, and state formation.

[190] A Preliminary Analysis of Clovis Biface Technology at the Topper Site, South Carolina
The Topper site in Allendale County, South Carolina is a multi-component site with an intact
buried Clovis deposit. This paper is a preliminary analysis of a sample of the biface assemblage
from the site. Analyses will focus on spatial patterns of distributions associated with biface
reduction, elements of the reduction sequence, and conservation of raw material in biface
manufacture. As one of few stratified quarry sites in the region, Topper has the potential to inform
our understanding of Clovis settlement and mobility.

[187] Are writing systems intelligently designed?
To explain why people do what they do, we need to attribute to them motivating goals,
knowledge, interests and reasons. We also need to describe how the world around them, in
which other agents and their artifacts feature prominently, determines their behavior. Finally, we
need to explain how biologically-evolved cognition supports the relevant behavior, motivations,
and interactions with the environment. Accounts of the emergence of literate behavior typically
focus on the first of these explanatory tasks. Focusing on the latter two encourages an alternative
to the conventional view of the origin of writing as an instance of "intelligent design".

to a greater diversity of marine and terrestrial foods including a greater commitment to maize-
based food production (800-500 BC). The timing of this shift suggests that it occurred as
increasing human populations impacted the availability of local resources. We argue that this
prompted the incorporation of a more diverse array of animal species hunted and harvested at
greater distances from the village. It is within this context that maize farming intensified locally.

[51] My People Trained Here: Perspectives on Stone Feature Age and Function
Determining the age and function of a stone feature within an archaeological or sacred site can
be challenging. Camp Guernsey, Wyoming, has many recorded stone features where age has
been assumed by archaeologists as modern or associated with National Guard training. During
Tribal consultation at Camp Guernsey in 2008, archaeological based assumptions of stone
feature use and age was challenged by a Tribal monitor. The challenge opened up discussion
among the project participants of ideas not yet considered. This paper presents the research of
discussed ideas which center on stone feature use and age on a sacred feature’s significance.

[68] Floor Plans and Potsherds: A Comparison of Domestic Architecture in the Chichen Iza-Ek
Balam Region of Northern Yucatan, Mexico
In our previous studies of domestic architecture in the Chichen Itza-Ek Balam borderlands, a kind
of house floor plan labeled “open-front” was interpreted to reflect a distinct ethnic identity. We
argued that the layout of residential architecture can reflect ethnicity and since the houses of
several communities in the borderlands were distinct from analogous architecture at both Chichen
and Ek Balam, these communities featured a distinct ethnicity. In this paper, we reconsider this
interpretation by closely examining the ceramics collected at domestic architecture in an effort to
determine if they were residences or had a different function altogether.

[184] Artifact taphonomy on desert pavement surfaces, Libyan Plateau, Egypt
Studies of desert pavements on the Libyan Plateau in the hyperarid Eastern Sahara provide a
taphonomic context for Paleolithic artifact assemblages associated with these surfaces. While
lateral immobility is strongly indicated for both artifactual and natural clasts > 5 cm in diameter,
downward mixing of small (<2.5 cm) artifacts appears common. This process, presumably
associated with sediment expansion and contraction during periodic wetting events, may account
for the lack of small flakes noted from surface collections. Small artifacts are susceptible to
significant lateral transport, potentially through creep, with the magnitude of disturbance tied to
microtopographic context and possible biogenic influences.

[1] Just How Useful is Archaeology for Scientists and Scholars in Other Disciplines?
I review the potential of archaeological data to make contributions to debates and research
beyond archaeology and anthropology. Archaeology’s long temporal span and emphasis on
material culture provide the foundation for its broader usefulness. Our greatest external
successes lie in the realm of human-environmental interactions over time. In the broad realm of
comparative and historical social research (e.g., urban studies, economics, political science)
archaeology has great potential to make contributions, but so far progress has been limited. I

[21] The Substance and Symbolism of Long-Distance Exchange
Long-distance exchange is a hallmark of ancient complex societies. The exotic provenance of
goods or raw materials is clearest when an object is of a recognizably non-local material or
crafted in a distinctly non-local style. Archaeologists have usually interpreted these exotica to be
indicative of high status because they usually are found in contexts otherwise identifiable as elite.
But "exotica" may have had many meanings for ancient people. In this paper I will examine two
cases of long-distance exchange to evaluate the range of potential meanings of long-distance
goods: trade between Mesopotamia and Egypt, and between Mesopotamia and the Indus.

Ancient Maya Iconography
Previous research has suggested that a left/right dichotomy has existed throughout Maya history,

This paper seeks to expand upon current research by offering a cognitive model of ranked
hierarchy based upon preferred architectural arrangements in ceremonial-precinct planning in
post-Classic highland Guatemala, linguistic evidence from early colonial documents, and
contemporary ethnographic research of civil-religious ceremonies and spatial orientations. New
linguistic and ethnographic data may suggest alternate interpretations of preferred orders in the

[185] Aguadas and Early Water Management in the Puuc Region of Yucatan, Mexico.
Water was a critical resource for Maya people living in a karst hill region where rainfall is highly
seasonal. For water retention, the Maya exploited natural depressions, modified others, and
excavated hollows to form water-holding ponds or aguadas. Importantly, aguadas can preserve a
record of settlement history and paleoenvironmental materials for detecting the strategies for
capturing and storing rainwater. In Puuc region aguadas are widespread but concentrate in
numbers at only a few known sites. At the Preclassic center of Xcoch, a series of possible
aguadas articulate with linear features (canals?) to suggest some form of early water
management that may have fundamentally shaped the development of Maya culture.

I peer through the glazes darkly to examine historical factors that contributed to the decline and

century reduced the number of villages producing glaze-wares; but European settlement created
demands for ots that saw a brief surge in the production of the late styles. Colonial requirements
for ceramics, unfulfilled by imports from Mexico, resulted in a substantial production by non-glaze
potters for Spanish needs. Further population displacement during the interregnum and
subsequent 1696 Rebellion resulted in the denouement of the Glaze-ware traditions.

mural production as a ritual act and a technology consisting of a sequence of operations requiring
objects, actions, personnel, and knowledge. Based on parallels in mural production in the historic
and pre-contact periods, I suggest that murals in both eras played similar roles in religious
observances.

Finely crafted objects at Mississippian centers have often been regarded as prestige goods,

ritual gear kept in bundles, which suggests that they could not have been exchanged or freely
given as gifts. Their abundance at Moundville suggests many practitioners of this ritual lived
there. Moreover, their widespread distribution suggests Moundville was a place of pilgrimage,
where elites from distant places traveled to acquire ritual knowledge and power.

order to use the methodological advances of lithic analysis to understand prehistoric human

process is necessary. Recent studies of lithic technology from the Early and Middle Holocene of
California are presented as an example of how current and past evolutionary theory can inform

[169] The Slipperiness of Boundaries: Identity and Interaction in west-central Honduras
Robert Sharer’s studies of large- and small-scale cultural and dynastic developments among the
Maya are central to his contribution to Mesoamerican research. Here, however, I emphasize the
impact of his earlier work at the edges of the Maya world. Sharer’s research in El Salvador and
Honduras lent momentum to a flourishing of interest in those peoples dwelling along the
borderlands and the long-running debate about the nature of their relationship with their Maya
neighbors. With Robert Sharer’s early contributions as a solid foundation, I explore the forging of
identities and socio-political interactions in the multi-ethnic landscape of west-central Honduras.

[19] Results of Archaeological Survey in the Xuenkal Hinterlands
Results of Archaeological Survey in the Xuenkal Hinterlands. In an effort to better define the
nature of the polity centered at Xuenkal, Yucatan, archaeological survey and mapping was
conducted in an 11.5 km transect connecting Xuenkal's periphery with the outlying center of
Dzadz Naranja. Survey efforts within the transect focused on: (1) the location and mapping of
nucleated settlements, making use of local informants and settlement signatures suggested by
analysis of satellite imagery, and (2) the location and mapping of all signs of ancient settlement
visible in cleared ranch pastures and burned milpas. Survey results indicate that the region
between Xuenkal and Dzadz Naranja consists of several nucleated settlements that contain both
Cehpech sphere and Sotuta sphere ceramics and provide significant new information about
regional settlement patterns related to the rise of Chichen Itza as a major center in the northern
Maya Lowlands.

[87] Variation, Identity and the Visible “Other” in the Prehistoric Southwest
As a socially constructed entity the skeleton embodies both social practice and biological status in
prehistoric societies. Ancient DNA, isotopes and biodistance studies illuminate migration and
marriage patterns, but not the degree to which people looked different to each other. Which
phenotypic traits constituted “otherness” in the past? This study addresses visible physical
variation -- in stature, robusticity, facial features, dimorphism, dental and cranial modification --
among prehistoric residents of the Southwest, and asks which variation reflects deliberate
construction of individual or group identity, and the ways in which physical variation might have
impacted the interaction of groups and individuals.

[148] Olmec and Epi-Olmec Burials at Tres Zapotes
Excavations conducted as part of the Proyecto Arqueologico de Tres Zapotes revealed six burials
that provide an exceedingly rare corpus of information on Olmec and Epi-Olmec mortuary
practices and health. Four of these interments (2 adults and 2 children) were excavated from a
single residential context located between Mound Groups 1 and 2. An isolated cache of miniature
ceramic vessels was also recovered here that resembled offerings in a nearby infant burial.
Another adult was found interred atop a sandstone formation a short distance away. The final
adult was located north of Mound 9: part of Mound Group 2. In total, these graves and their
offerings provide a diachronic perspective of mortuary programs, wealth, and health associated
with ‘middle-to-upper’ class residential barrios at Tres Zapotes from the Early Formative through
the Early Classic. This paper will describe the context and form of the burials as well as their
material offerings. The Tres Zapotes burials are then compared to available mortuary data from
contemporaneous settlements elsewhere in southern Veracruz.

[1] Urban Health from Prehistoric times to a Highly Urbanized Contemporary World
Cities are recent in human history and present a new environment because of more population
density. Archaeology and history reveal that cities varied greatly among different societies, but
have similarities in health risk. History reveals that as population density increased, health
declined and mortality increased until the 20th century. Prehistoric Mesoamerican urban
populations, Teotihuacan and Copan, will be compared to the preindustrial cities of London and
Rome to indicate how humans had to adapt to a new disease and morbidity environment. The
health situations of contemporary cities will be compared with that of the past to highlight

[141] Putting an end to the iconoclastic past: The logics of heritage preservation in contemporary
Egypt
The story of imperial powers dynamiting monuments, exhuming numerous corpses and carting
their treasures off down the Nile in order to fill curiosity cabinets, museum display cases and
storerooms across the globe, is well known. In part these actions would be justified as countering
the threat posed to Egyptian archaeological heritage by destruction at the hands of iconoclasts
and ignorant peasants. The emergence of controlled excavation and legal frameworks for
archaeological practice did little to resolve the irony of this situation. The destructive forces of
preservation continue to serve as the curative to the now iconic figure of the sebakhin or the
Muslim fanatic intent on the defacement of an un-Islamic past. This paper explores the logics of
this preservationist impulse in order to question why ruins can no longer be tolerated as such. I
contend that these logics are not dissimilar to those employed in certain acts of iconoclasm.
Using the example of recent developments in the historical preservation of Islamic Cairo/Fustat I
argue that much is lost by this new composure towards the material traces of the past which have
been ushered in through the cultivation of a particularly secularized heritage sensibility.

Understanding Vulnerabilities during Social Transformations
Different patterning of prehistoric animal use across the American Southwest can be a product of

The idea that early states and empires may have been of limited cohesiveness territorially is
certainly reflected in our contemporary understanding of the Mauryan Empire, a 4th-2nd century
BC empire whose borders are often demarcated by a series of inscriptions found across the
Indian subcontinent. Although these inscriptions do make reference to conquest, there is little to
suggest that these statements refer to explicitly territorial conquests. This paper presents a case
study which explores the concept of Dharma Vijaya or "conquest by Dharma", and examines the
networks of relationships through which the Mauryas may have exerted social power across both

How did people make a home out of a warzone? Within their fortified plazas, New Mexicans lived
in mixed communities under the pressures of the sistema de casta, a socioracial hierarchy based
on perceptions of blood purity. Just outside the walls, tensions with nomadic slave raiders, poised
to strike at any moment, maintained a baseline of fear. Rather than fall back on one, static model
of social performance to mitigate these tensions, one colonial community seems to have
mobilized an eclectic mix of ethnic, class, and gender roles to keep both their enemies and their
colonial administrators guessing.

Excavation and surface collection of three residential compounds at Cerro Leon has resulted in

The hoe tips are large, corner-notched bifaces, most of which have well-developed edge and

indicates the compounds were important loci of tool maintenance and discard. This suggests
noble families at Cerro Leon played an important role in the exchange and use of hoe tips in the

Human landscape use is a complex system of resource monitoring, selection, and impact linking

Georgetown phase (AD 600s), Mimbres farmers discerned subtle ecological differences in similar
environmental settings. They incorporated that knowledge into land-use decisions: large, long-
lived settlements were built in settings resilient to short-term climate fluctuation; smaller,
temporary settlements took advantage of enhanced productivity following wet intervals. Local
decisions and actions about appropriate agricultural strategies in different settings supported
sustainable regional occupation.

Moche iconographic depictions of combat are suffused with religious meaning and formed part of

inextricably tied to religious practice. I argue that pragmatic military campaigns among the Moche
were conditioned by ideological structures of “ontological predation,” or destructive regeneration,
a deeply embedded cultural principle in the Andes that directly shaped political and economic
conflict in Andean prehistory. A consideration of Moche structures of practice reveals that Moche
warfare cannot be categorized as exclusively ritualistic or secular in nature.

[130] Social Complexity and Conditions of Change at El Dornajo, Southwestern Ecuador
We still know very little about the response of communities in prehistory to either environmental
hazards or changing geopolitical conditions, especially as to how those responses might have
affected the developmental trajectory of such communities. The site of El Dornajo, El Oro
province, Ecuador was investigated with the goal of counterpoising the role of these conditions on
social change and development in the region. Preliminary results indicate that a large El Niño
event and increased interaction in trade systems both occurred at the site in proximity to
increased hierarchical activity. This poster presents those data and discusses their relevance to
the questions stated above.

[69] Time Team UK: 16 years of televised archaeology
As Professor for the public understanding of Archaeology at Bristol University and the
creator and Series Producer of Time Team I would like to provide both an overview of
TimeTeam's achievements and give a summary of the archaeological response and challenges.
The role of Time Team in independently funding over 180 excavations, 50+ on scheduled sites,
has created a resource for archaeologists that has not only evaluated, at no cost to public funds,
a vast number of sites but also "transformed the public's view of archaeology." Balancing the
needs of broadcasters with the requirements of producing high quality archaeology on some of
the most important sites in Britain - Hadrian's Wall, Lambeth Palace, Salisbury and Canterbury
Cathedrals, and the Queens Royal Palaces to name a few, while also liaising with statutory
bodies -English Heritage, Historic Scotland etc. has created a unique body of evaluations data
and experience which has now been active for over 15 years. As Time Team begins working in
other countries, including in 2008 a series of 5 programmes for PBS, I am keen to explore the
inter-relationship with new archeological colleagues as at the heart of Time Team has always
been a partnership with the local archaeological community.

[119] A Case for Qochas as Agents of Salinization in the Titicaca Basin
Often categorized as one of the principle methods of agricultural production during Tiwanaku
governance of the Titicaca Basin, qochas and their true impact on the Andean landscape have
received limited scholarly attention, at least in comparison to raised field complexes and terrace
systems. However, after a direct comparison of qocha systems with both Andean and global
analogues, it has become my contention that their impact on the hydrological balance of the basin
may have been enormously detrimental. By contributing to processes of salinization, they may
have played a role in the eventual demise of agricultural viability within the greater basin.

The Preclassic Maya site of Xtobo, located in northwest Yucatan, Mexico, has produced an
intriguing feature of unknown function. This feature covers more than 6 hectares and is
surrounded by a series of sacbe-like structures. Inside of the feature only one significant structure
is to be found. One possible explanation for the feature is that it served as a marketplace for
Xtobo and the region. We conducted soil sampling and geochemical analysis of the feature along

[184] Understanding Lithic Raw Material Selection: Middle Paleolithic Assemblage Organization
and Local Decision-Making
Any middle range theory linking stone artifact assemblages to the dynamics of settlement system
structure must emphasize the spatial context of raw material exploitation. Three Middle Paleolithic
archaeological sites from different regions of Portugal facilitate the exploration of the influence of
local raw material availability on prehistoric stone tool economies. An ecological model of chert,
quartz, and quartzite availability developed through extensive geological sampling provides a
secure understanding of the resource background within which past stone reduction decisions
were made. Artifact assemblage variation across raw material types indicates that Late Middle
Paleolithic populations in central Portugal were organized around local resource exploitation with
little long distance raw material transport. Nevertheless, some preferential selection of raw
material type did occur at each site, with significant choice of quartz at Vale Permego, chert at
Casal dos Carvalhais, and surprisingly, quartz at Vinhas.

Recent research has uncovered two features consisting of standing stone rings at the
multicomponent agricultural site of Pirque Alto near Cochabamba, Bolivia. These features
contained slag resulting from copper smelting at high temperature, the analysis of which by

domestic refining furnaces. We utilize information from past research on the site of Pirque Alto as
well as ethnographic accounts of huayrachina use to imply a Middle Horizon date for the features.
Finally, we discuss the inter-regional economic implications of Pirque Alto residents engaging in

[13] Mineral Wealth and Value: Tracing the Impact of Early Spanish Colonial Mining on Puebloan
Pigment and Paint Production.
From the entradas of the late sixteenth century to the Pueblo Revolt of 1680, Spanish
prospectors exploited mineral resources by accessing Pueblo landscape knowledge, labor and
practice. The use of ore minerals formed an important nexus of practice between divergent
concepts of wealth and value held within both Spanish colonial and Puebloan economies of the
protohistoric and early colonial period. This paper explores the possible impacts of colonial
mineral appropriations on Pueblo pigment production by tracing the effects of new forms of labor
appropriation, workshop contexts of production, and competing notions of landscape resource
potential established in the seventeenth century.

Basic assemblage analysis at small farm sites across the American South indicate a correlation
between a decline in utilitarian ceramics and an increase in glassware during the first half of the

correlates of the social and technological changes experienced by farmers in the South during
this period. This presentation more closely examines the idea that this particular change in artifact
material type is a valid indicator of modernizing farm practices.

was organized at the polity level by elites, then artifact classes associated with elites should have
a restricted distribution in specific areas where elite-controlled production occurred. To
understand the way that craft production was negotiated at Moundville, this study examines data
from off-mound residential areas excavated as part of four seasons of the Early Moundville

Venus iconography is common in Mesoamerican and Southwestern cultures. These include

Although Venus glyphs are depicted in various media such as murals, ceramics and carved or
pecked stone, they tend to be two dimensional renderings of cruciforms or pointed stars. In
Casas Grandes culture, the cruciform icon assumes more plastic expressions such as flaked
stone, ceramic and stone vessels, as well as architectural features including a cross-shaped
room and the Mound of the Cross at Paquime. All suggest appreciation and representation of
ethnically diverse, but shared concepts of duality.

Archaeology is contingent upon connecting small pieces of evidence, from small episodes of
activity, to larger questions about social change. ‘Microarchaeology’ has been used to describe
studies of both microscopic material culture and small-scale human practices. The second
meaning derives from ‘microhistory’, standing in contrast to the longue durée – small events and
processes that structure human experience: ordinary activities or obscure singularities not
intuitively linked to dramatic shifts. This paper traces the different origins of these concepts and
the methods and theories through which they are applied, arguing that both provide perspectives

[63] Power at the Margins: Iron Age Landscapes of the Talgar Fan in Southeastern Kazakhstan
The distribution of Iron Age burial kurgans and settlements during the first millennium BC across
the Talgar alluvial fan in Southeastern Kazakhstan, north of the Zailiisky Alatau Range represents
a symbolic and political landscape marking the local control of fertile land along ancient
streambeds. Paleo-ethnobotanical and zooarchaeological data from three excavated Iron Age
settlements prove the existence of a mixed farming and herding economy at villages and hamlets.
We posit a model by which agro-pastoralism rather than mobile pastoral nomadism was the
primary factor in the social evolution of complexity at the margins of the Eurasian steppe.

[67] Aztec Ritual Caves
Mesoamerican cave imagery became a subject of investigation in 1972 when Doris Heyden
speculated about the long cave beneath the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan. The inquiry
developed at a system of Aztec sites and continued in the Maya field and other major cultural
areas if Amerindian antiquity. This paper reviews the fundamental Aztec information, noting key
archaeological sites and ethnohistoric sources describing cave temples a places for rites of
passage and as components in a network of symbolic settings linking society and city to the
natural landscape and the deified forces of nature upon which life depended.

[4] The violence that ended it all: Bioarchaeological analysis of interpersonal trauma at the site of
Kuelap, Chachapoyas, Peru
Recent discoveries at Kuelap shed light on a violent event occurring during the early colonial
period. Human skeletal remains were discovered on the floors of five circular house structures at
the south end of the site, crushed beneath rocks from the dismantled walls. Osteological analysis
revealed that 90% of the individuals exhibited evidence of perimortem blunt-force cranial trauma.
In many cases, injuries demonstrated fractures consistent with star-shaped maces, the
prehispanic weapons used by both Chachapoya and Inka warriors. This is first evidence that
demonstrates intra-regional indigenous conflict may have also contributed to depopulation of the
Andes during early historical times.

[174] Ancient Landscape, New Methods: Remote Sensing-Guided Geoarchaeological Survey in
the Western Nile Delta
Archaeological exploration in the Nile Delta has been confined to relatively few expeditions from
recent decades. This circumstance relates to research priorities and how site-centered research
is "mapped" within cognitive and legal frameworks. Recent research by the Durham University
mission to Sais has integrated GIS-guided analyses of remote sensing imagery, historical maps,
ceramics, and geomorphological data to elicit a history of settlement in the western Delta during
the mid-late Pharaonic to late antique periods (1250 B.C.E. – 600 C.E.). An exciting early result is
a heretofore unmapped branch of the Nile that was a distributary of the Canopic.

[84] Rock Art Traditions that Define Cultural Entities
Rock art sometimes defines cultural entities more definitively than other archaeological data.
Differences in ancient rock art traditions may reflect temporal or geographic separation. Dating
evidence suggests that a sequence of rock art traditions on the northern Plains was created by
new cultural groups moving into the area. The most ancient rock art was replaced by a different
tradition that lasted thousands of years. Finally the second tradition ended, replaced by totally
different rock art. Interpreting this third shift as a population change is supported by simultaneous
changes in lithic assemblages, which have been overlooked by non-rock art researchers.

[8] Anxiety in Town and Country: Struggles for Power and the Transformation of Systems of Food
Production in Third Millennium B.C. Upper Mesopotamia
Rather than vessels of highly functional order and efficiency, burgeoning state societies have
alternately been viewed as platforms for the enaction of a range of social, political, economic and
ecological stresses and anxieties. Perhaps chief among the producers of this anxiety are inter-
and intra polity struggles for power between groups and individuals whose actions serve to
transform established systems of food and craft production and consumption. This paper explores
these linkages, through the examination of changes in systems of animal production in mid-late
third millennium Upper Mesopotamia, where a highly integrated system of city-states developed
and then disintegrated by 2000 B.C.

[64] Does the popol nah really exist in Late Classic Maya lowlands?: Implications for a Late
Classic political model
Although the popol nah was an important place and political-social institution in the Colonial
Yucatan Peninsula, available evidence suggests that the popol nah, or "council/mat house," may
not exist in the Late Classic in the southern Maya lowlands. Recently, scholars have presented
evidence that the preeminent example of the popol nah at Copan is not actually a popol nah, but
a wayb'il nah, or "dreaming/sleeping house." This casts doubt on the role of the popol nah in the
Late Classic and has several implications for the changes seen by archaeologists in political
models at the end of the Classic period.

[177] Broken bodies: Disciplining the body and the body politic in ancient Wari society
When states sanction violence against the body and orchestrate rituals showcasing bodily
destruction and display, they create normalizing discourses about destroyed bodies and those
engaged in their destruction. Although this serves to normalize violent acts, it may be that only
particular forms of violence are “appropriate”. Thus, only the proper violent actors may be
valorized, which shapes discourses about aggression and brutality and proper bodily
comportment more generally. This paper uses data on skeletal trauma and iconography to
explore such constructions of violence and how they structured ways of being and the body politic
in the Wari empire of the Andes.

Given the Cehpech-Sotuta dilemma on dating the transition from the Classic to Posclassic in the

dating the transition. This work will try to create a parallel to the C-shaped structures found in

the site center that features columns normally associated to civic architecture. The columns are
centered on an apparent later addition that will be dated by associated ceramics and a
comparative analysis with the rest of the structure. This should give us an approximation of the
date when the columns where set on the structure. It will also be argued that these columns were
originally incorporated to this structure from a civic context and were only moved after the
importance of civic structures had dissipated. Complementing this data with survey information
from the site center, and published data from other Northern centers will help on further define
this transition from the Classic to the Postclassic, creating a model to be tested elsewhere in the
region.

1.5Ma). The hominin H. habilis was apparently an omnivore and the ancestor of humans, while A.
boisei was a vegetarian with an 80% diet of C4 plants – probably sedges of the wetlands – who
became extinct by ca. 1Ma. Among other fauna, there were some notable extinctions: the grazing
elephant (Elephas sp.) and the grazing short-necked giraffe (Sivatherium sp.) were replaced by
the browsing elephant and giraffe species that we know today. Most of the fossil species,
however, survived into modern times unchanged or evolved into closely related forms. The
carbon isotope ratios of the fossil fauna were 1.5 per mil more positive than those of their modern
counterparts in the Serengeti National Park; this difference is the result of the Industrial
atmosphere of modern times and can be discounted. The oxygen isotope ratios of the entire
faunal community, however, became more positive by 5 per mil sometime during the past 1.5
million years. It is my hypothesis that the major oceanic source of rainfall in northwest Tanzania
at 1.5Ma was the Atlantic Ocean, with the heavy 18O isotope preferentially raining out of the
clouds as they traveled over the Congo basin. At some point during the past 1.5 million years, the
major oceanic source of rain changed to the Indian Ocean, producing the bipolar rainfall regime
of today. This hypothesis is being investigated by isotopic measurements of the current rainfall in
the Serengeti and of fossil fauna of different ages from Olduvai Gorge.

Diverse connections, relationships, and interactions exist among peoples who share similar

terms of accessibility, visibility, use, and meaning. Some are highly visible foci for public
performances or community events; others are restricted meeting places for secret societies.
Religious architecture is both a material embodiment of shared ideas and a place for shared
experiences. In what ways do these shared ideas and experiences translate into community? I

[44] Innovation and Natural Selection in Paleoindian Projectile Points
Natural selection decreases variation in functional traits. Substantial changes in the selective
environment can release previous selective pressures leading to stimulated variation in a new
environmental context. Natural selection will then sort this variation, thereby creating new
adaptations. The end of the Clovis period corresponds with shifts in the selective environment
reflected in projectile points. It therefore should correspond with a period of substantial increases
in the variation in point morphology followed by decreased variation around adaptive designs. We
explore the manifestation of this pattern in the morphology of Paleoindian points throughout North
America.

since 1995 have uncovered an Etruscan sanctuary and industrial zone occupied from the 8th –
2nd centuries BCE. In 2007 and 2008, the Poggio Colla Coring Project undertook a systematic
coring survey of the area. The goal was to incorporate a minimally intrusive method to elucidate
secondary settlement sites, especially where dense forestation prohibited traditional walking
survey. This paper presents the initial survey results. Utilizing a 30mm gauge and a 100mm sand
augur, the project cored an area of 35 hectares on a 25 x 20 meter grid around the settlement’s
acropolis. The gauge allowed an analysis of stratigraphic matrices, while the wider augur core
retrieved samples of associated archaeological material. In combination with geopedological
landscape analysis and geomorphological mapping using GIS software, the project yielded
significant results. The size of the area preserving Etruscan anthropogenic occupation sediments
indicates a larger dependent suburban zone to Poggio Colla than previously hypothesized. These
results can either help to focus potential future excavation toward significant anthropogenic strata
or be used in tandem with non-intrusive techniques such as ground penetrating radar and
geophysical prospection. More generally, employing coring surveys to map occupation levels
associated with other secondary sites in Etruria may revise notions of their extent, thereby
changing how scholars view settlement patterns and landscape exploitation. Overall, coring
survey can fill the methodological gap between single site and regional exploration by
characterizing the area surrounding a single site.

[150] Cattle, Canines, and Cuy: The First Cuisines of the Columbian Exchange
The first Europeans in the Caribbean brought enough provisions to last for months. They had no
knowledge of the available resources, and they desired familiar foods from home to alleviate the
problems they were sure to face abroad. Yet new evidence from ceramic vessels suggests the
Columbian Exchange occurred immediately as the colonists were forced to adopt the local
cuisine. Their hosts, the Taínos, used imported foods themselves shortly after contact. That the
traditional subsistence patterns in both cultures changed so quickly in response to new people
and a new environment is an interesting tale of interaction.

[148] Paleoethnobotany at Tres Zapotes: Spatial and Temporal Patterns in the Production and
Consumption of Plant Foods
This paper considers temporal and spatial variation in plant remains at the site Tres Zapotes. It
differs from my previous considerations of paleoethnobotany at this site in that the number of
flotation samples under consideration has doubled to 200+. This doubling of the sample size
allows us (1) to document temporal changes in maize production with more clarity, and (2) to test
previous patterns of elite/non-elite food consumption that were based on less data, namely that
non-elites supplemented their maize-based diets more heavily with tree fruits than their elite
counterparts.

[112] Spirits of Potteries
Some pueblo potters believe pots are alive. They view making pots as mutual encounters,
negotiations, and exchanges between themselves and Mother Earth’s living gifts (e.g., “selfish
clay”). This interaction creates “a new being” in the form of a pot, which has its own spiritual and
material aspects. Because the creation of and interaction with these new agents (potteries in the
vernacular) involve the spiritual/immaterial and material realms, they are necessarily marked with
rituals. This paper explores this interaction and the essential role that the spiritual aspect of
pottery played in Southwestern mortuary contexts.

[113] Home Turf: Archaeology, Territoriality, and Politics
We provide a prolegomenon to the symposium “Territoriality in Archaeology” by first
distinguishing the concept as employed in this session (a spatial strategy to affect, influence, or
control resources – pace Sack) from its use in studies of animal behavior. Referencing
comparative ethnographic material and research in political geography, we situate territoriality
alongside related keywords – “landscape,” “region,” “domain,” “hegemony” – and discuss
problems with previous writing on the subject. We argue that territorial control is a dynamic,
variable component of sovereignty in both ancient and modern polities and explore the
methodological implications of this perspective.

[179] A Comparative Analysis of Projectile Point Types from the Duwamish and Marymoor Sites,
Puget Sound Region, Washington
Recent studies of projectile point types in the Pacific Northwest suggest that type variability and
distribution are more complex than previously thought. The comparative analysis of projectile
points from the Duwamish (45KI23) and Marymoor (45KI9/A - 45KI9/B) sites with other sites in
the region suggest that although a high rate of variability in the morphological attributes of these
points exists, this variability does not signify new point types, but rather, an expansion of the
influence of existing styles. This paper outlines the continuing analysis of Pacific Northwest point
types and raw material variation.

events of use and abandonment of the site, material culture variability and distribution, and
boundaries between households inside the local community.

Societies
Religiously motivated cooperation in the form of pilgrimage is a neglected element in the
evolutionary dynamics of cooperation. In this paper we take a comparative approach to
pilgrimage by evaluating Chaco and Nasca, two prestate middle-range societies where pilgrimage
was an important component in maintaining cooperation, group cohesion, and identity. We
compare materialization of ideology through ceramic iconography and production in both
societies. While specific patterns are distinct in each society, we argue that pilgrimage had a
significant impact in the evolution of both cooperation and leadership in Chaco and Nasca.

Through experimental reproductive methods some of the mystery behind the production and use
of bone tools such as awls, projectile points, hide working tools and pottery decorating tools can
be unraveled. Specific tools such as awls, projectile points and incising tools were found to be
used in more than one task throughout their lifetime. Hide preparation tools were found to be
sequestered on specific areas of a site and tended to favor particular animal types as sources of
raw materials. A pottery decorating tool was discovered to be the creator of patterns referred to
as a fingernail motif.

[53] High Resolution LIDAR mapping of the Sny Magill Mound Group, Effigy Mounds National
Monument, Iowa
The Sny Magill Mound Group contains over 100 conical and effigy mounds dating to the
Woodland period and numerically is the largest surviving group of prehistoric mounds in the
United States. Due to the large size of the site and the density of only recently cleared vegetation,
mapping efforts at the site have not provided the kind of detail necessary for in depth study of the
mound group. During late 2007, high resolution LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) mapping of
the mound group was completed with analysis of the data in 2008. The new data has provided
information about mound construction and provided evidence of what are believe to be
maintenance activities. The data has also been used to verify the location of several low elevation
mounds that were previously undetectable. This new data has allowed us to look at the layout of
the entire mound group in perspectives that had not been previously possible and may provide
new insights to the mound building culture of northeast Iowa.

[151] Understanding Post-Chavin Mortuary Behavior: A Taphonomic Analysis of Human Remains
from Chaván de Huántar, Peru
Scattered post-Chaván (200-1200 AD) human remains from a drainage canal at Chaván de
Huántar are examined for evidence of natural and anthropogenic modifications in order to
determine if these are disturbed or secondary burials. Results show that although differences in
breakage and element representation are marked between burial loci, skeletal remains (MNI=16)
were intentionally deposited in the canal as secondary burials. The spatial orientation of crania
also suggests that they were deliberately retained at a central locus, perhaps as a form of
ancestor veneration. This study marks the first formal investigation into post-Chaván mortuary
behaviors at the site.

[46] Genetic Stratigraphy and Paleosol Development on St. Catherines Island, Georgia:
Paleoenvironmental and Archaeological Implications
The recent identification of at least three deeply buried early Holocene and late Wisconsin age
paleosols on St. Catherines Island, Georgia documents multiple episodes of barrier island
stability over the last 22,000 yrs. Paleosols (allogenic genetic units) reflect prolonged episodes of
landform stability and hence are excellent chronostratgraphic maker horizons which can be
recognized in interbasin-intrabasin and coastal stratigraphic correlations. Further study of these
paleosols and their bounding autogenic genetic facies will provide important information on
paleoenvironments, climate change, eustatic sea level fluctuations and the potential for identifying
deeply buried early sites on stable Georgia Bight barrier islands.

Community organization during the Late Bronze Age in northern Kazakhstan is difficult to

[29] Paleoarchaic Lithic Procurement Strategies in the Central Great Basin: A Spatial Approach
Paleoarchaic (11,500-7500 B.P.) hunter-gatherer mobility strategies in the central Great Basin
are often interpreted as adaptive mechanisms for human survival. Lithic provenience datasets
from eastern Nevada indicate early prehistoric populations engaged in large-scale residential
movement to acquire subsistence resources and raw toolstone material. Preferences for specific
sources of fine-grained volcanic rock suggest lithic procurement decisions warranted a
consideration of geographic and geologic factors. This analysis employs spatial technologies to
assess three variables: distance, terrain, and faunal catchment, in relation to lithic source
preference. Results reveal that potential for social interaction, rather than energetic concerns,
drove Paleoarchaic lithic procurement decisions.

[75] Foraging and Farming in the Desert Borderlands
The fact that a reliance on maize agriculture occurred much later in the area of the Jornada
Mogollon, as compared to other regions of the Southwest, underscores the importance of
understanding the variability in timing, context, and nature of early agriculture. The interplay
between foraging and farming was presumably a fragile one, with the exact balance being
determined by several factors, including population demography, resource structure, and rainfall.
It is this interplay which forms the backdrop to understanding the changing role of foraging vs.
farming in the Tularosa Basin of southern New Mexico.

For the short-term, we are renting off-campus warehouse space and are again accepting
archaeological material, but at a substantial increase in our costs. Given increasing expenses and
decreasing state support we have implemented new fee structures.

[112] Artifact Agency: A Communication Theory Approach
This paper applies an artifact based theory of communication to the study of object agency. This
framework construes interactions between people and things as transfers of information. People
react or interact to information they glean from things resulting in behavioral variation that over
time changes the life histories of objects. Archaeologists can then examine those changes to infer
forms of artifact agency and how they vary in different historical contexts. To illustrate this framing
of artifact agency as a communicative process we examine changing social statuses of ceramic
actors during the Mimbres and Postmimbres pueblo periods of southwestern New Mexico.

Palynological studies were conducted in a 2003 homicide case. The pollen analysis tested

Pollen was processed from three different samples which included the hair, intestinal tissue, and
the underlying carpet on which the deceased was found. The microscopic analysis of the
palynomorphs recovered dietary pollen grains and the type of environmental pollen spectrum
found at the crime scene. The dietary pollen and background pollen supported one of three police
hypotheses. Further studies were planned to collect and identify the pollen spectrum at the crime
scene in order to strengthen the preliminary results. However, our preliminary results were
sufficient for the authorities at that time. Also, a plea bargain brought closure to the case and
terminated further studies. However, recently, the pollen evidence in the case is being re-
analyzed for statistical purposes which may help U.S. forensic pollen studies gain more
acceptance in the forensic identification professional community and possibly the court system.

In 1974 Chinese archaeologists recovered three lengthy inscriptions on ritual vessels from the

[118] Hunter-Gatherers on the Canadian Plateau: the 2008 archaeological investigation of the
Bridge River site.
Housepit villages of the Middle Fraser Canyon, British Columbia, provide a locus for research and
debate concerning socio-economic and political change among hunter-gatherer peoples. The
2008 field season at the Bridge River site integrated geophysical studies and archaeological
excavations to reveal deeply stratified occupation floors containing hearths, cache pits and large
assemblages of lithic artifacts and faunal remains. This paper presents an overview of the 2008-
2009 Bridge River project and considers implications for our understanding of emergent
complexity in the Interior Pacific Northwest with a particular emphasis on the period of 1600-1100

[75] Early Formative Period Villages in the Hueco Bolson
The Mesilla phase (A.D. 200/400 to 1000) in the Jornada region is known primarily from the
excavation of a few villages and some other, smaller residential and logistical sites. FB16985,
located low on an Organ Mountains alluvial fan, appears in ways similar to other early villages
such as Conejo and Turquoise Ridge. Using data obtained from recent excavations at FB16985,
we compare and contrast this village with others and add to this growing database. We briefly
describe the site and its constituent elements, make comparisons with other Mesilla phase
villages in the region, and suggest productive directions for future research.

The integration of multiple geophysical methods provides complimentary data in determining the
location and dimensions of unmarked graves. Using two geophysical instruments, ground-
penetrating radar (GPR) and a conductivity meter (EM), two sections of Greenwood Cemetery
(Orlando, Florida) were surveyed. The first is a marked section which served as a control for the
study; the second is an open area (50m2) containing numerous unmarked graves that was
surveyed using different transect intervals and profile orientations. The processed data was
compared to assess the optimal delineation and resolution of unmarked graves. Methodological

[16] Shepherding the Herd from the Household Corral into the Political Arena: Formative Period
Herding in the Lake Titicaca Basin
Cooperation and surplus mobilization are key factors that underwrite change in sociopolitical
organization, from small communities to multi-community polities. Pastoral economies are
compatible with surplus production since: 1) animals are easily stored “on-the-hoof” and 2) careful
herd management enables the productive demands of the both the domestic and political realms
to be met. Faunal remains from Formative Period agro-pastoralists living in the Lake Titicaca
basin serve as a case study – to help differentiate how domestic versus political agendas shaped
herd animal exploitation. To this end, herd management practices were studied and context-
specific differences, in processing and assemblage composition, were identified.

[138] Demographic and Health Status Patterns from the Late Neolithic Collective Burials of
Bolóres (Torres Vedras), Portugal: Methodological Considerations and Results
There is compelling archaeological evidence that during the 2nd and 3rd millennia BC in the
Sizandro and Alcabrichel river valleys population density increased, social stratification emerged,
and interregional interaction intensified. However, information about the biological effects of these
changes is limited. This paper details the results of the analysis of human skeletal remains from
the Late Neolithic collective burial of Bolóres (Torres Vedras) and compares the findings from this
burial with others in the immediate vicinity. The special methodological considerations of working
with commingled and fragmentary remains from collective burials are also discussed.

that accurate material be presented, but also that inaccurate stereotypes be refuted. While not
formally an “on-air spokesperson” for all American Indian cultures throughout 20 centuries of

the 16th Century Community at Malata, Peru
Beginning in the 1540s, Franciscan missionaries based in the colonial administrative city of
Arequipa began entering the small agrarian communities in the Colca valley, marking the
beginning of a long transition in the Collagua region from Inca to Spanish imperial, ideological,
and economic influences. Archaeological inquiries from 2006 to 2008 at the site of one such
community, Malata, shed light onto the effect of this spiritual and economic conquest on the
production of ceramics, textiles, and metals. Our preliminary explorations examine the
organization of labor, space, and production within households at Malata.

Morrison’s (2000, 2002) existential principles of ‘person’, ‘power’ and ‘gift’ as foundational
ontological, epistemological and axiological precepts, this paper empirically finds that the Navajo
hooghan qualifies as an other-than-human person who shares blessings and a reciprocal

much Shield rock-art to possible Midewiwin ceremonialism. However when considered in
isolation, most of the symbols highlighted by previous research are not necessarily diagnostic of
the Midewiwin. Rather, it is certain configurations of the signs, as they occur together, that appear
to be unique to the Midewiwin. This study identifies plausible cases of Midewiwin rock painting
sites through semiotic examination.

This study attempts to elucidate some of the environmental and cultural constraints limiting the
timing of American bison (Bos bison) migration into the North American Southeast. By combining
previous spatial and temporal data from reported bison finds and paleoecological data from the
Southeast, we propose that environmental change (coincident with the timing for the Little Ice
Age) coupled with decreased human population densities associated with the perceived Vacant
Quarter are responsible for the late arrival of bison to the region. Further, an increase in
agriculture and hunting pressure during the 19th Century led to their rapid extirpation from the
Southeast.

Ceramic-phase occupation on Tutuila Island is thought to be restricted to the coastal margins.
Recent fieldwork on the western portion of Tutuila has increased number of known ceramic-
bearing sites. These new sites demonstrate that ceramic-period occupants utilized uplands and
highland resources habitually. The increased number of upland and highland sites indicates that
ceramic-period inhabitants utilized natural resources across a wider geographic area and also
had a more diverse settlement pattern that previously known. A preliminary chronology of
ceramic-period cultural movement in regards to resource availability, volcanic activity and
population pressure is addressed in response to these findings.

[142] Riverfront Village and the Practice of Storage: A Subterranean Feature Analysis
Due to how little attention has been paid to village sites in the past, less is known about how
individuals performed daily activities and constructed their social environment. The identification
and analysis of above ground and subterranean storage facilities has also been limited (Anderson
et al 1995:281). In this paper argue that studies on subterranean storage are necessary for
understanding how individuals interacted within large-scale and small-scale sociopolitical
structures. Subterranean storage is an effective means of removing surplus from public
ownership and reserving it for private consumption (DeBoer 1988). How did peripheral
Mississippian communities exercise their own creative control to support sociopolitical structure
or employ efforts to resist it? This study is an attempt to fill the “fuzzy space” in Southeastern

[112] Sense and Essence in Native California Iconography
Few aspects of the archaeological record seem less material than iconography, partly
contributing to linguistic analytical approaches reflecting the modern European worldview. This
bias contradicts indigenous theories of origin and being, and renders indecipherable much
ethnographic commentary. Attention to indigenous knowledge instead demonstrates that rock art
resulted from spiritual agency; that motifs were not signs but power objects that activated and
could be activated by shamans; and that this made them dangerous. Daily avoidance matched
against ritual supplication resulted. Recognizing iconography not as signs but as power objects
has important implications for understanding the political prehistory of the far west.

[53] A GIS Analysis of Spatial Data From the Carrizo Plain National Monument
The application of GIS to archaeological data has proven to be a highly effective analytical tool.
Using site inventories from the Carrizo Plain NM, we can address both management concerns
and research hypotheses. GIS based site risk assessments and site location prediction models
are useful for management planning. These same data are manipulated to explore prehistoric
settlement patterns. In the Carrizo Plain, it has been observed that there is a temporal shift in site
location and population density that may correspond to drying trends associated with the
Medieval Climatic Anomaly. We examine these hypothesized spatial patterns using a GIS
approach.

[14] Conflict and Confusion on the Middle Savannah: The Late Seventeenth Century Occupation
At Riverfront Village, Aiken County, South Carolina
Riverfront Village is located on the South Carolina side of the Middle Savannah River. European
trade goods and radiocarbon dates indicate that the latter occupation (1610 to 1730) is both
concurrent with the founding of Charleston and predates the arrival of the Westo by perhaps 60
years or more. The site may have been raided, abandoned, and then reoccupied after the final
destruction of the Westo in 1680. Untangling the confused overlap of historical references,
archaeological occupations, and modern interpretations for the region is a distinct challenge. This
excavation of this site provides a few more pieces to the puzzle.

Labrador. This site differs, however, in lacking the metal, glass and ceramics that are the
hallmarks of an occupational spillover into the historic period. Given the relatively late date of Inuit
colonization of the Labrador coast, and the early penetration of European goods north, this tightly
constrains the period of occupation to the decades around AD 1500, and so provides an
unusually clear window on the colonizing moment.

[50] Turkish Flintknappers and Technological Change
As threshing sledges became obsolete in the 1980s, the village of Cakmak, Turkey lost the
industry that had made it a wealthy village, mining flints and knapping them into blades for use in
the sledges. Knapping families increased investment in farming, applied their knowledge of stone
working to other crafts, or migrated to urban areas. The general patterns of change visible in a
late survival of lithic technology apply to many specialized crafts. At Cakmak, as elsewhere, we
are in the last generation with the chance to record ethnoarchaeological observations of flint
knapping.

[99] Results of 2008 test-pitting to define the ceramic chronology around Teozacoalco in the

Mixteca Alta archaeological surveys rely on ceramics from the ground surface to date sites.
Researchers apparently work with well-defined ceramic chronologies to do this, but publications
typically do not provide details about ceramics except to relate them to types published by
previous Alta or Valley of Oaxaca projects. Superficial treatment of ceramic chronologies makes it
impossible to evaluate them or apply them to other projects. In 2008 the Teozacoalco
Archaeological Project test-pitted sites to recover the ceramic sequence in the area of the Mapa

Migration Period pendant amulets called gold bracteates are found far from their Scandinavian

their importance for the formation and maintenance of identity, and the continued use of the

[173] Thinking Outside the Vessel:Variability in Native Ceramics of the Northeast
In the Northeast’s Connecticut River Valley, traditional scientific approaches to ceramic analysis
can be misleading. Algonquian people created well crafted ceramics exhibiting a great deal of
variability in production technique and functional use. Yet, due to harsh conditions for
preservation, it is rare to find whole vessels and more common to find a wide variety of sherds
designed and produced using different techniques. The question to be explored in this paper is:
How can Indigenous perspectives change the way archaeologists look at Native ceramics, the
people that made them and our approach to analysis?

[174] Virtual Data: Making Web-based Data Sharing Work for Archaeology
The internet has revolutionized the way we conduct research and interact with our colleagues, but
few archaeological projects have committed to sharing their data via the web. Projects that have
created web-based systems face myriad problems from unwieldy data structures and faulty
website architecture to complex and confusing user interfaces. Although a growing number of
archaeologists are interested in sharing data via the web, most of us lack the time and skills
necessary to create a successful website. This poster outlines a flexible and proven approach to
web-based data sharing created by information technology professionals working collaboratively
with archaeologists.

[146] A regional perspective on Little Ice Age impacts on Inuit settlement patterns and
subsistence in Dog Island, Labrador.
The Dog Island area of northern Labrador consists of a cluster of small islands located within the
range of inter-annual variation of the seaward edge of land-fast sea ice. Several winter
settlements, occupied for variable lengths of time during the Little Ice Age (LIA), are scattered
among these islands. Recent multidisciplinary research at five of these winter settlements are
reviewed in order to examine links between site location, subsistence and sea ice conditions,
focusing on zooarchaeological reconstructions of hunting practices and seasonality at multiple
sites, the application of high-resolution dendrochronological dating and sea ice modeling.

[18] Transforming Archaeology: untangling post-depositional processes at LA 26917 in the Valles
Caldera National Preserve (VCNP)
People accessed obsidian quarries and other resources in the Caldera throughout the Holocene,
leaving behind various materials including millions of flaked stone artifacts. Post-depositional
processes have impacted this archaeological record significantly. To address the resulting
interpretive difficulties, studies of soils and geomorphology were combined with bulk lithic
analysis and obsidian hydration. The data were analyzed in light of process-based models of
bioturbation and landscape change. The results provide a foundation for building inferences
about the past and suggest directions for future research. They also imply that nuanced
approaches to post-depositional disturbance are useful in general and necessary in some
contexts.

[171] Inventing Florida: Constructing a Colonial Society in an Indigenous Landscape
Beginning with the 1513 discovery of Florida, Spanish explorers and colonists embarked on a
lengthy process to incorporate the American Southeast into the expanding Spanish colonial
empire. Concurrently attempting to establish colonial bases along the coast and to penetrate and
fortify the vast interior, Spanish efforts throughout the sixteenth century were significantly
constrained and shaped by the political organization and social geography of the indigenous
societies already inhabiting the landscape. The resultant configuration of the multi-ethnic colonial
society that was Spanish Florida at the beginning of the seventeenth-century reflected a unique
accommodation between Spanish and Indian political and economic systems.

[62] The New Uses of Old Images: Artifacts of the Zhongshan State in Ancient China
Outsider groups who established themselves as rulers in ancient China used various artifacts to
display political power and cultural identities beneficial to their regimes. Discoveries from tombs of
two generations of Zhongshan Kings (4th century BCE) and its capital city of Lingshou in central
Hebei Province revealed how Zhongshan rulers created and displayed artifacts to forge public
images that signify new identities in relation to other states and ethnic groups. This paper
discusses how artifacts from both the Zhou system and the Northern groups were adopted and
transformed in the display to convey complex new meanings for the Zhongshan rulers.

[185] Local Water Management Practices among the Ancient Maya
Recent research suggests that ancient Maya water management techniques were centralized
and controlled by elites residing in urban centers. However, survey and excavations at Chan in
western Belize revealed water management systems operating entirely at the local level. Small
aguadas, irrigation canals, and natural springs associated with agricultural terraces demonstrate
that many forms of water management at Chan were outside the direct control of nearby elites.
While Maya elites may have controlled the collection and distribution of water in and around their
centers, evidence of local water management practices demonstrates that Maya farmers retained
significant autonomy.

[18] Domestic Turkeys in the American Southwest: Imported Birds or an Independent
Domestication Event?
Ancient DNA analysis of the extinct Meleagris gallopavo gallopavo from central Mexico and 1600-
2100 year-old turkey coprolites from the Turkey Pen Ruins site in southeastern Utah provides
evidence on the origin of the domestic turkey in the Southwest. All the Utah coprolites were from
Merriam’s turkeys (M. g. merriami), a subspecies that is genetically distinct from the central
Mexican variety. These data, coupled with those from present-day wild turkeys, indicate that
domestication in the Southwest was independent of that in central Mexico. Conserved matrilines
in the archaeological examples provide evidence of controlled breeding by Basketmaker II
peoples.

[24] After the Olmec: Southern Veracruz Monumental Sculpture
Inhabitants of the Mixetquilla-Tuxtlas region of south-central Veracruz inherited the cultural legacy
of their Gulf Olmec forebears manifest in a highly developed visual vocabulary, with monumental
sculpture a key feature in ceremonial space. From the 1st Century BCE -10th Century CE, Epi-
Olmec artists continued this tradition at sites such as Tres Zapotes, La Mojarra, and Cerro de las
Mesas. Iconography and hieroglyphs exhibit gradual change through time, while incorporating
external influences from their Mesoamerican neighbors. In this paper I examine this cohesive
body of sculpture, as part of regional processes, through the shifting lens of temporal styles,
motifs, and religion.

[86] Swahili urban landscapes on the east African coast
The dozens of tenth- to fifteenth-century Swahili stonetowns along the East African coast are
understood as urban centres characterised by their mercantile function. Recent archaeological
research focusing on the relationship between towns and their hinterlands has exposed great
diversity among towns, and led to a reanalysis of what urbanism means in this area. This paper
presents the results of research at two cities, one each from the northern and southern Tanzanian
coast, to explore the potential of Swahili towns for a reconsideration of how urban spaces are
constituted and lived, especially in the context of their hinterland populations.

Human sacrifice in prehispanic Mesoamerica, as a cultural and symbolic act, has been

perception and representation that these contemporary sacrifices imply and the way in which they
are related, or not, to ancient sacrifices. This will be achieved through the analysis of the

[102] Obsidian Tool Production and Distribution in a Postclassic Lowland Maya Community
Obsidian was an important resource used by the Maya for a variety of purposes. This paper will
examine the local production and distribution of obsidian tools based on the technological study
of artifacts collected from excavations at Zacpetén. This site is a Postclassic to Contact period
community in the Petén lakes region of the Maya lowlands, and it was an important regional
center for the Kowoj. By looking at the different contexts where obsidian tools were produced and
consumed, inferences can be made about the dynamics that organized this ancient community.

in the final Jomon Period (c.3300-2500 cal BP). Onishi shell mound, which is the biggest one of
them, is 185 meter in length and 2.5 meter in depth of the layer. There are two peculiarities about
them. The first is that they don't include fish bone, animal bone, fishing implements and pottery
but only shell. The second is that clam (Meretrix lusoria) occupies over 90 percent of the whole
shell. We estimate Jomon people boiled and dried clams to exchange and trade.

The Townsend Archaeological Project uncovered over 20,000 archaeological features, 82% of
which are posts. Archaeological deposits at Townsend represent a non-stratified multi-component
site, which presents a suite of problems for understanding site structure diachronically. Intra-site
spatial analysis of geographic and relational attribute databases is used to designate Woodland
structures and activity areas. These features are then examined across the site and by temporal
affiliation. This research provides a quantitative method to clarify contextual ambiguities that arise
in temporally complex archaeological sites.

[143] Time and Tradition in an Early Copper Age (ECA) Community in Southeastern Hungary
Körös Regional Archaeological Project investigations at adjacent ECA sites documented changes
in community and household organization during the transition to the Copper Age. Calibrated
radiocarbon dates were used to develop temporal contexts for these changes. Bayesian analysis
with BCal and OxCal programs showed that the small fortified sites were occupied contiguously in
phases of 30-50 years. The younger site was established before the older was abandoned. When
large nucleated Late Neolithic (LN) communities dispersed and established small ECA
settlements, the pattern of vertical accretion that created the LN tells morphed into a pattern of
lateral accretion at the smaller communities.

primary material selection and utilization in Japan
The physical properties of Paleolithic raw materials could have significantly influenced various
stages of tool manufacture and the tool performance. For comprehensive understanding of
material selection and utilization in Paleolithic age, as one of the influential properties of lithic
materials, microhardness was analyzed on four different types of rocks that were frequently used
in Japan. It was found that the microhardness values of the samples were invariably ranging from
approximately 5 GPa to more than 10 GPa, which are similar to those of advanced ceramic
materials used to manufacture modern cutting tools.

Eight major site areas or loci were identified during 2006 Phase II archaeoloigcal investigations at
PO-29. They were described as a Midden Mound, Batey, Gully Top Midden and Features, Trench
6 Chican Ostionoid Midden and Features, Trench 7 Deeply Buried Midden, Trench 12 Midden,
Scrape C and Historic Artifacts, and Scrape G Midden. These areas were identified by landscape
features, discrete midden deposits, and subsurface features. During Phase III investigations in
2007, each locus was investigated by hand excavating a number of test units. This was followed
by machine assisted scraping to document sub-surface features. As a result of these
investigations, 407 features were identified including 80 burials, post holes, pit features, and
various other features. A number of house or other structural patterns have been identified from
preliminary analysis of feature data. As well, 318 stone slabs associated with batey wall
alignments were identified.

[133] New Insights into Hierarchical Dynamic between Sacalaca and Parcela Escolar, Quintana
Roo.
During the 2008 season, an approximately one kilometer-long transect was mapped between two
previously studied sites – Sacalaca and Parcela Escolar - in the Cochuah region of Quintana
Roo, Mexico. Two goals of the survey included: 1) to clarify if these two sites were a single
aggregate or two distinct sites; and, 2) to determine hierarchical and spatial relationship between
studied sites. Previous research proposed affiliation or some degree of dependence of Parcela
Escolar to Sacalaca based upon territorial extent, the layout and makeup of the sites. The natural
features of the landscape such as cenotes, caves, and deep soil pockets played a significant role
in the political superiority and ranking of the sites. Therefore, variation and categories in the
hierarchical levels can be hypothesized based upon spatial and temporal relationships of the sites
and presence of prominent architectural components, and distinctive natural features. Recent
findings, however, reflect a new dynamic in hierarchical and spatial relationship of the
investigated sites.

[167] Landscape 3d Modeling And Animation For Public Outreach And Education
The Neolithisation in Japan during the Jomon Period involved two different stages: an earlier one
(10000 BP – 5000 BP) characterized by a waterfront shell middens, and a later one (5000 BP –
3000 BP), defined by the development on trading networks and a more efficient exploitation of
natural resources due to the use of complex technologies. Both stages influenced important
changes in landscape (Uchiyama, 2003). By means of the database collected in the Lake Biwa
area correspondent to the Jomon Period (Seguchi et al, 2008), this paper discusses the use of
GIS analysis together with 3D visualization and animation techniques in order to share the

[94] To Become A Mountain Hunter: A Study Of Resilience In The Blackfeet Indian Reservation,
Montana
The decade of 1880 marks the near extinction of the American bison and the lifeways it
sustained. This paper examines the conditions under which a bison-hunting society coped with
devastating ecological change, territorial circumscription, and repression by modifying their
relationship with the landscape within culturally acceptable parameters. Among the Montana
Blackfeet, resilience was achieved largely through the development of a post-bison hunting
complex that involved rapid shifts to intensive high-elevation hunting of ungulates, concomitant
change in the size and composition of hunting groups and hunters’ social networks, and
adjustment of ancient religious views and ritual practices to new hunting conditions.
