[258] SYMPOSIUM · ON THE VALLEY FLOOR: REGIONAL VARIATION AND
CULTURAL DIFFERENCE IN SOUTHEAST MESOAMERICA
The Ulua, Chamelecon, and Motagua rivers carve out extensive
valleys where ancient Southeast Mesoamerican cultures flourished.
While their inhabitants share elements of construction techniques,
architectural forms, and artifact assemblages, there is considerable
variation: sites with Copan-style Maya characteristics alongside
centers with local architectural canons; settlement sizes ranging
from 15 to over 450 structures; and widespread ceramic systems
where design elements are re-worked to suit local ideals. This
session explores these contrasts, comparing landscape use,
ceramic production, storage, architecture, and intra- and inter-site
planning patterns during the Late and Terminal Classic periods with
an eye to their implications for socio-political practice.

This session considers aspects of dress, adornment, and ritual
costume among the Formative period cultures of ancient
Mesoamerica and adjacent areas. It was during this period that
many of the costuming practices of this region originated; however,
this topic has not yet been addressed synthetically in Precolumbian
archaeology or art history. The papers in this session consider a
variety of issues relating to this topic including the reconstruction of
clothing and non-fabric ornamentation practices, their symbolic
dimensions, and aesthetics. These topics are interrogated through
case studies that focus on particular sub-regions, sites, monuments,
or individuals known through the archaeological record.
