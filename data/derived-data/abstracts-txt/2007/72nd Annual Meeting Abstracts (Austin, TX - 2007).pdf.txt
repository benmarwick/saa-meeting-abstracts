[1] SYMPOSIUM • BORDERS, BOUNDARIES, AND BRIDGES IN TEXAS ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY SAA ANNUAL MEETING PROGRAM COMMITTEE)
Texas archaeology and archaeologists provide us with an opportunity to explore the
materiality of social boundaries, tug at the borders of typological categories, and build bridges
among seemingly disparate intellectual, theoretical, and professional categories. In this
session we explore current research and practice in Paleo-Indian research, models of hunter-
gatherers, collaborations among Native peoples and archaeologists, cultural resource
management, and the archaeology of colonization. All of these topics have much to contribute
to the archaeology of the Americas more broadly.

[8] FORUM • CHACO AT 100 YEARS: THE FUTURE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE CANYON
In 2007 Chaco Culture National Historical Park celebrates the centennial of its founding.
Chaco is one of the most-studied places in American archaeology, but the era of big
government archaeology is over. In the future, Chaco Canyon archaeology involving
excavation will need to be broadly collaborative to justify the impacts. However there are a
range of non-destructive research projects the park would encourage. The park seeks to
engage the profession in a discussion about its research needs and the current interests of
Chacoan scholars and students, with the goal of determining where those interests intersect.
[9] SYMPOSIUM • NEW HORIZONS IN INCA ARCHAEOLOGY
In addition to the period of imperial expansion in the Late Horizon, Inca archaeology
encompasses research into the formation of Inca society in the LIP and Inca and Spanish
interactions throughout the Andes during the Colonial period. This is a forum for scholars
pursuing investigations on a broad range of Inca-related topics and employing a variety of
methodologies, such as excavation, survey, ethnohistory, ceramic analysis, GIS, etc. Topics
include research into new questions as well as new data addressing old questions. This forum
is intended to update scholars on current research and to promote cross-fertilization amongst
Inca archaeologists.
[10] SYMPOSIUM • THE FRYXELL SYMPOSIUM: INNOVATIONS IN BOTANICAL AND BIOLOGICAL
ARCHAEOLOGY (PART 1 OF 2)
(Sponsored by SAA Fryxell Symposium)
The Fryxell Symposium is in honor of Vaughn Bryant for his interdisciplinary research in
botanical analyses within archaeology. The symposium focuses on new techniques,
innovations, research, and analyses within the framework of botanical archaeology,
specifically, and biological archaeology generally. Vaughn's research has included the realms
of palynology, phytoliths, coprolite analysis, paleoethnobotany, DNA, and forensics. Focus is
on the newest innovations and syntheses rather than a rehashing of old issues.

[11] SYMPOSIUM • ANCIENT ANCESTORS IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
In a 2002 Antiquity article, James Whitley argued that archaeologists were increasingly relying
on ancestors as an all-encompassing explanation for prehistoric behaviors. Contributors to this
symposium critically evaluate the idea that ancestors played prominent roles in past societies
of major world regions, including North America, Mesoamerica, South America, Europe, and
Africa. Papers emphasize the identification of ancestors as conceptual components of ancient
societies using material remains (including funerary structures, human remains, art and
iconography, structured deposits, and architecture) and explore how textual, ethnographic,
and ethnohistoric materials may contribute to the study of ancient ancestors.
[12] SYMPOSIUM • IS HINDSIGHT 20/20? EXPLORING THE APPLICATION OF VISUAL MATERIAL TO
ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS
Visual material, such as depictions, decorations, and architectural arrangements, provide
modern researchers with a specific, deliberately created form that can allow them to
understand aspects of the past otherwise invisible in the archeological record. It can be
examined from a variety of perspectives, including focuses on content, context, or on the
ancient act of seeing itself. The purpose of this session is to bring together researchers
focusing on visual material in archaeology from a variety of different theoretical perspectives
and regional focuses to examine how visual material is currently being employed in the
discipline and how it can be improved.
[13] SYMPOSIUM • BEYOND ILLUSTRATION: 3D RECONSTRUCTIONS, VIRTUAL REALITY, AND
ARCHAEOLOGICAL COMMUNICATIONS IN THE EARLY 21ST CENTURY
This session explores the state of computer-aided visual communications in archaeology
today. Individual papers will focus upon recent 3D reconstructions, virtual reality, online
interactivity, and the history of archaeological illustration. Perspectives taken by the
participants will range from technical production using commonly available 3D rendering
software, remote sensing data, and project databases to the role such projects play in the
fields of art history, education and communications. Presenters will draw upon their own
examples of interactive reconstructions - from archaeological sites in the Americas to Roman
architecture.
[14] GENERAL SESSION • THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN
[15] SYMPOSIUM • LIVING ON THE LAND: THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POPULATION AND
AGRICULTURE IN THE AMERICAS
Agricultural societies are intimately linked to their natural environments. Not only are they
dependent upon the attributes of their environments, but their practices can significantly alter
it. These local attributes and alterations can markedly impact production levels that, in turn,
have important implications for population dynamics including population levels and
distribution. The papers in this session demonstrate the ways that ecological and
environmental variables have been used to address various aspects of agricultural production
and population dynamics. These papers represent multiple disciplinary approaches applied in
a range of cultural and ecological settings throughout the Americas.
[16] SYMPOSIUM • PROYECTO ARQUEOLÓGICO NAACHTUN: THE FIRST THREE YEARS
The ancient Maya city of Naachtun is one of the least known of all major Classic Maya
centers. Although presently considered a very remote place, during the Classic Maya period,
Naachtun was very much in the thick of things. Given the grand size and strategic location of
Naachtun, there is little doubt that it was the capital of a very prominent Classic period
kingdom. This session summarizes the results of the recent archaeological and epigraphic
studies carried out at the site by the Proyecto Arqueológico Naachtun since 2002 and
presents future directions of investigation.
[17] SYMPOSIUM • BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS AND THE SEA: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SOUTH COAST OF PERU
Data from numerous recent and ongoing research projects on the south coast of Peru permit
archaeologists to make great strides in reconstructing the culture history of this important
region of the New World. These research programs provide a basis for interpretations that
contribute to general archaeological interests and theory such as power, agency, identity,

politics, economy and ecology. Papers presented in this session reflect the contributions
researchers are making to these larger thematic issues and when taken together provide a
sense of the south coast’s significant position in the sweep of Andean prehistory.
[18] SYMPOSIUM • HEARTLAND IN THE HINTERLANDS: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE HUASTEC MAYA
OF THE NORTHEASTERN GULF COAST OF MEXICO
The Huastec region in northeastern Mexico has often been viewed as a peripheral area, and is
largely omitted from mainstream archaeological discourses concerning the development of
Mesoamerican civilizations. The convergence of archaeological, art historical, ethnohistorical,
and ethnographic data increasingly highlights the heterogeneous nature of Huastec identity,
and underscores the complex ways in which Huastec inhabitants were affiliated with peoples
of Central Mexico, the Southern Lowlands, and even the Southeastern United States. This
session seeks a more detailed understanding of what characteristics define the ancient
Huastec and examines their role in the development of other Mesoamerican cultures.
Participants also explore how interdisciplinary perspectives can yield a more holistic vision of
this important, albeit neglected, Mesoamerican region.
[19] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON INDIGENOUS RESISTANCE TO SPANISH
COLONIZATION IN THE NEW WORLD
This session examines indigenous resistance to Spanish colonization via the archaeological
record, investigating not only the violent uprisings, but also the subversive, hidden transcripts
of resistance enacted in everyday life. Case studies from North, South, and Mesoamerica will
explore the limits of Spanish domination and the varieties of indigenous resistance: overt and
covert, active and passive, and opposition via mimicry, mockery, appropriation, and
ambivalence. Through these studies we hope to recover the details of indigenous resistance
not recorded in official histories, while identifying shared patterns as well as unique strategies
of resistance across the New World.
[20] SYMPOSIUM • ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF AGRICULTURE IN EAST ASIA
Research on agricultural origins and development in East Asia has been advancing quickly
during the last few years. East Asia produced some of the world’s most important crops such
as rice and soybean, so a broader discussion of current research, including claims for great
antiquity of rice domestication is critical. This session will critically evaluate the latest evidence
for the development of agriculture in China as well as for the timing of the spread of agriculture
to, and the role of local processes in Far Eastern Russia, Korea, Japan, and Taiwan.
[21] SYMPOSIUM • COPPER AGE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION ON THE GREAT HUNGARIAN PLAIN: THE
LAST YEAR OF THE KÖRÖS REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT
The transition from the Neolithic to the Copper Age in the Carpathian Basin is marked by
changes in nearly every aspect of social organization—from the distribution of cultural groups
across the landscape to the organization of households on settlements. Since 1998, the Körös
Regional Archaeological Project has been investigating sites in southeastern Hungary to
clarify the nature of these changes. This symposium presents the results of the multi-
disciplinary research that occurred during the final season (2006), including extensive
excavations at the Early Copper Age settlement of Körösladány-Bikeri and magnetometry
surveys of other nearby sites.
[22] SYMPOSIUM • ISLAND WORLDS APART: INTERACTIONS AND REMOTENESS ON SEAS AND
OCEANS
Questions of how peoples colonized islands and the linkages they forged with other groups
have long been pervasive in the archaeological study of island societies. It is clear that a wide
variety of goods, artifacts, animals, plants, and knowledge were transported to and from
islands across vast distances. Although there was often a high degree of interaction between
many island groups, others remained partially or completely isolated from the outside world.
This session examines cases of both interaction and remoteness in the study of islands
worldwide to better understand how connections and isolation shaped island cultures.
[23] SYMPOSIUM • PAPERS IN HONOR OF ANTHONY E. MARKS AND HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO
ARCHAEOLOGY
Professor Anthony E. Marks (Southern Methodist University) has conducted archaeological
research on five continents. His efforts have done much to shape regional sequences,
, 4                                            ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 72nd ANNUAL MEETING
introduce novel analytic protocols, inspire new behavioral interpretations, and spawn
generations of students. The papers of the symposium, presented by friends, colleagues, and
former students focus on the prehistory of Portugal and the Levant and range from Middle
Paleolithic to Neolithic in temporal emphasis. In many ways the eclectic nature of the
contributions mirrors the diverse career of Professor Marks.
[24] FORUM • GETTING OUR DATA OUT THERE: THE WHERE'S, WHY'S, AND HOW'S OF STUDENT
PUBLISHING
(SPONSORED BY SAA STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE)
"Publish or perish" is a truism at all levels of professional research – including that of the
student. This forum presents a panel of past and current editors from peer and non-peer
reviewed journals and several publishers, and is designed to benefit students and
professionals new to the publishing world. Topics for discussion include: (1) steps for
publishing research; (2) obstacles to publishing; (3) strategic publishing (choosing an
appropriate venue for your research, as well as choosing which research to publish); and (4)
publishing ethics (publishing similar material in multiple journals, and questions of authorship
and intellectual property rights).
[25] SYMPOSIUM • HABITUS AND HISTORY: SCALE AND EXPLANATION IN DEEP-TIME
ARCHAEOLOGY
Time scale is important. However, archaeologists have usually assumed that time is
transparent: that either social models grounded in ethnographic time can be extended to deep
time, or that functional explanations of change over deep time can be postulated without
considering the immediate scale of meaningful human action. This session investigates how
archaeologists can theorize multiple scales of time. Does time scale impose structure upon
history? How does explaining a millennium pose different problems than explaining a
generation? Are different concepts, causal processes or methodologies required? Papers
address these questions with case studies from North America, South America, and Europe.
[26] SYMPOSIUM • THE GREAT WESTERN TRADE ROUTE AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND DECLINE OF
CLASSIC MAYA CIVILIZATION
For a century scholars have debated the role of interaction between ancient lowland Maya
city-states and the very different societies of the volcanic highlands to the south. Yet 200
kilometers of the great western Maya trade route of the Pasion river and Verapaz montaña,
the highland/lowland interface, remains unexplored. This gap is being filled by intensive multi
disciplinary research projects in this zone. Preliminary results document complex interaction of
interregional and local economics, religion, and politics that defined the centers of this “Ruta
Maya” and its role in the apogee and collapse of the Classic Maya Kingdoms.
[27] SYMPOSIUM • SPYING ON THE PAST: ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF DECLASSIFIED
INTELLIGENCE SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHY
The 1995 declassification of 800,000 scenes from the United States’ CORONA intelligence
satellite program has provided a brilliant new tool for archaeological research. Declassified
imagery programs have now made a high resolution dataset available for large areas of the
world and at reasonable costs. This session will bring together case studies in CORONA-
based landscape and settlement pattern archaeology. Papers will highlight a variety of ancient
landscapes and demonstrate how their features can be reconstructed using CORONA;
consider the strengths and weaknesses of CORONA imagery; and show how CORONA can
be used with other datasets and ground observations.
[28] PRESIDENTS INVITED FORUM • PEOPLING THE AMERICAS
The peopling of the Americas is one of the central abiding issues for Americanist Archaeology
regardless of individual archaeologist's research or intellectual emphases. The topic is also
one in which it is difficult to stay reasonably current, giving widely scattered publishing venues
and rapidly evolving fields such as the use of DNA evidence. This forum brings together three
experts in the fields of archaeology, genetics and paleoenvironments to discuss their take on
the topic and where they see research heading and/or where it should be going.

[30] POSTER SESSION • ARCHAEOMETRIC METHODS, ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS
(PART 1 OF 2)
Archaeometry, the application of scientific techniques to archaeological questions, is not a
new field of study. Indeed, archaeologists have applied physical, chemical, and geological
methods to archaeological material since the 1700s. Today, archaeometry is increasingly seen
as a discipline in its own right with a distinct vocabulary and professional journals. Increased
communication and understanding between archaeologists and archaeometrists is
fundamental for mutual benefit. In an attempt to facilitate this communication, participants will
focus on down-to-earth explanations of methods and their application to anthropological and
archaeological research. Part 1 addresses stone tools, ochre, soil, and stable isotopes.
[31] POSTER SESSION • GEOPHYSICAL APPLICATIONS AND ADVANCES IN NORTH AMERICAN
ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY SAA GEOARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP)
Geophysics is undergoing a period of rapid innovation and growth in North American
archaeology. The low contrast of the archaeological record and unique history of
investigations underlie the emergence of a number of characteristics that distinguish North
American archaeological geophysics from research conducted elsewhere. Examples include a
stronger focus on ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and electromagnetic induction methods, the
adaption of downhole sensors for archaeology, the use of geophysics within excavation units,
recent developments in data fusion, and a growing emphasis on verification. Posters in this
symposium showcase recent directions and diverse contributions of geophysical applications
to North American archaeology.
[32] POSTER SESSION • RECENT RESEARCH IN THE CASAS GRANDES REGION OF CHIHUAHUA,
MEXICO
In 2006 the University of Missouri and University of North Florida conducted a collaborative
field reconnaissance of the region surrounding Janos, Chihuahua approximately 50km north of
Casas Grandes and 50km south of the U.S. – Mexico boundary. This area is within the
generally acknowledged boundaries for the Casas Grandes culture and just south of the
Mimbres region of New Mexico. The posters in this session provide a summary of the results
of the survey including in-field artifact analyses, discussion of the relationship between these
settlements and neighboring culture areas, as well as other research conducted on Casas
Grandes materials.

Scientific investigations in the Mirador Basin of northern Guatemala have generated new
perspectives on the rise, processual dynamics, and demographic reductions of early complex
societies in the northern Peten of Guatemala. A compendium of the various multi-disciplinary
studies presents a range of environmental and societal factors that contributed to the
precocious cultural florescence, continuity, and ultimate demographic reductions that occurred
in the Mirador Basin. The resultant data demonstrate the intertwined roles of environmental
response, societal interactions, and cultural behaviors in crafting explanatory models for
incipient complex societies in the Maya Preclassic and Classic periods.

This symposium examines the newest, as well as traditional archaeological approaches to
managing the diverse cultural resources in the federal sector. At the turn of the 20th century,
federal agencies received the charge to protect America’s cultural resources. The National
Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management developed
management plans that have become increasingly important as federal archaeologists emerge
as the only line of defense in protecting, preserving, and managing America’s unique
archaeological heritage. Papers in this symposium discuss stewardship, resource
assessment, preservation, and education.
[41] SYMPOSIUM • THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR: RECENT ROCK ART RESEARCH FROM THE
SOUTHWEST, THE HIGH PLAINS, AND THE MIDWEST
(SPONSORED BY SAA ROCK ART INTEREST GROUP)
In the western hemisphere, rock art, whether painted, pecked, scratched or engraved, has
played differing roles in the cultures that created it. Rock art has created portals between this
world and others, marked territories, and recorded the presence of individuals and events.
Whether located in rockshelters, rock overhangs, boulders, or bedrock, rock art represents
communication at a basic level. It offers a window into the minds of peoples who lived here in
past times. The papers presented in this symposium explore rock art in its many forms, be
they sacred or secular.
[42] SYMPOSIUM • TRANSPORTATION ARCHAEOLOGY: JUGGLING CULTURAL RESOURCES,
PRESERVATION, AND PUBLIC BENEFIT
Archaeologists employed by departments of transportation frequently find themselves juggling
cultural resources, public funding, and improving transportation facilities. Academia trains
archaeologists to view the preservation and leisurely excavation of archaeological sites as the
norm. However, the need for transportation improvements means that all cultural resources
are not equal in terms of preservation. Also, furthering our understanding of the past must
demonstrate public benefit. This session will explore how transportation archaeologists reach
decisions regarding cultural resources impacts, handle large-scale excavations, and balance
public need with the stewardship of cultural resources.
[43] GENERAL SESSION • SOUTH AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY
[44] SYMPOSIUM • FILLING THE GAP: QUESTIONING THE MEANINGS AND METHODS OF CURRENT
RESEARCH IN NEW ENGLAND ARCHAEOLOGY
How we recognize and present the past is becoming more crucially important as CRM
archaeology in New England hastens full steam ahead into the future. From excavation
techniques to presentation, from stone tools to pit houses to ubiquitous red-earth features, the
information that archaeologists are collecting and are required to collect varies from state to
state and from one job to the next. Coordinating what we know and how we know it, what we
are looking for and how we record it, and who the recipients of the information are is the
theme presented throughout these case studies from Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire
and Connecticut.
[45] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN ANIMAL INTERACTION IN NORTH
ASIA
Complex relationships have long existed between humans and animals in North Asia. These
relationships took many forms, including predator-prey, domestication, and veneration and
likely were embedded within nearly all aspects of ancient cultures. The archaeological record
of human-animal interaction in North Asia is extensive, but not well known in the West.
Relatively recently, many nations in this region have become more accessible to non-local
researchers, and many collaborative archaeological projects are now underway. Presented
here are papers drawn from such projects in Russia, Mongolia, China, and Japan. Time
periods examined range from the Upper Paleolithic through the historic period.

[46] SYMPOSIUM • INTEGRATING ARCHAEOLOGY AND HISTORY IN OAXACA, MEXICO
The culture area corresponding to the state of Oaxaca, Mexico, is known for the plethora of
archaeological and (ethno)historical resources, which were explored by scholars for over a
century. Additionally, oral traditions common to this ethnically diverse region are often
considered as a potential source for reconstructing the past. Rather than focusing on a
specific period or culture, this session will survey the applied and potential integration of
archaeological, (ethno)historical, and oral data sets in various case studies before and after
the Spanish conquest, and attempt to find common grounds for the formulation of theoretical
and methodological guidelines.
[47] SYMPOSIUM • CURRENT RESEARCH TRACING THE TRANSITION FROM NATIVE TERRITORIES TO
EUROPEAN SETTLEMENTS IN SOUTH TEXAS
Research in the Lower Nueces River Valley and Gulf Coast of South Texas is generating
information about settlement patterns from AD 1400 to 1900. Over this period Indigenous
settlements with a long tradition of tool manufacturing, hunting, and resource processing were
replaced by European Land-Grant colonies. From Copano Bay to the inland coastal plains
there was a dramatic cultural transition and economic shift in settlement patterns. The focus
on settlement as a study unit in South Texas is offering a fresh research approach for
documenting social organization, domestic activities, and regional integration patterns over
distinct cultural periods.
[48] SYMPOSIUM • REPATRIATION LAW, THEORY, AND PRACTICE
Repatriation is founded upon humanitarian concerns and structured by a legal framework, but
successful implementation requires well-developed methods and theory. Museums, federal
agencies, and tribes utilize evidence that can span thousands of years while military and law
enforcement agencies handle cases involving the more recently deceased; nonetheless, the
theory and practice of repatriation is similar. Parallels include the consideration of legal
requirements, application of historical and scientific methods, emphasis on consultation, and
attention to cultural and religious sensitivities. Examples of repatriation cases and legal
analyses demonstrate best practices and contribute to a body of theory regarding repatriation.

session presents papers from the private, academic, and government sectors of cultural
resource management in the islands. Taken together, they represent a range of issues
currently of concern in the islands, including the relationship between micro- and macro-scale
analyses, the construction of regional prehistories, and what the profession may or may not
offer the residents of Hawai’i today.
[52] SYMPOSIUM • THE UNESCO WATER PROJECT: THE LEGACY OF THE ANCIENT PAST
Because water is essential, controllable, and primarily responsible for configuring both natural
and built landscapes, complex interrelationships evolved between people and their
environments. An assessment of early complex societies—ecologically invasive social
orders—reveals fundamental organizational aspects shared with present-day societies. As
identified here by a subset of archaeologically minded contributors, the UNESCO book project
accents these adaptations with the aim to best understand the cultural parameters of water
use. By illuminating the social origins and maintenance activities associated with the
development of water systems, we see how humans have engaged fundamental aspects of
economy, political organization, and power relationships.

interregional linkages and proposing grand syntheses distinguished him in an era of increasing
academic specialization. The papers presented here are all inspired in some way by Andrew’s
work, and by their variety speak to the breadth of his contribution and continuing influence on
our understanding of prehistory.
[54] SYMPOSIUM • THE LEGACY OF SPANISH COLONIAL ARCHEOLOGY IN TEXAS: RANCHOS,

Spanish Colonial settlement in Texas was accomplished by several methods, including
ranchos, missions, and presidios. Two scholars who witnessed the birth of Spanish Colonial
Archeology in Texas, Thomas Campbell and Anne Fox, leave current students a significant
legacy. Contemporary studies continue to focus on missions and presidios, with growing
emphasis on rancho settlements. This session will summarize the legacy of early Texas
Colonial archeologists, current efforts to rehabilitate mission collections, the results of recent
investigations at the Presidio at San Sabá and Mission San Antonio de Valero, European-
made and Native ware colonial ceramics, and ethnicity on Nuevo Santander ranchos.

Paynes Creek National Park, to the partially inundated island trading ports of Wild Cane Cay
in Port Honduras Marine Reserve and Moho Cay off the coast of Belize City, the papers in this

used in the analyses.
[58] SYMPOSIUM • COMPLEXITY AND TRANSFORMATION IN WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY
Complexity, perhaps one of the most important concepts in archaeology, is still poorly
understood in terms of its implications for the study of social development and history.
Neglected in most archaeological studies of complexity are the novel and unpredicted
outcomes resulting from historical interactions among and between societies. In order to make
studies of complexity more dynamic, we suggest a need to focus on and/or identify the
transformative processes that worked to create unique social histories. Commensurate with
these goals, participants will discuss issues of complexity and transformative elements among
groups following small-scale economies from around the world.

tempered with other materials is debated. How much was the increase in frequency of shell-
tempered pottery a pan-regional phenomenon? How much was local adaptation? How much
can be understood in terms of cultural transmission? How much is due to selection of superior
functional qualities? Are there connections with rise of social complexity or spread of maize
agriculture? This symposium looks at the issue from the perspective of selective regions

[68] SYMPOSIUM • RESIDENTIAL BURIAL: A MULTI-REGIONAL EXPLORATION
(Sponsored by Archaeology Division, American Anthropological Association)
Ancestral-descendant approaches to burial ritual view mortuary remains as part of the living
societies in which the deaths occurred. This session examines cases where the association of
living and dead is unambiguous, namely, societies where human remains are situated within
residential domains of the living. “Residential burial” takes many forms and has been identified
in various regional, temporal, and social contexts. New World and Old World societies,
mesolithic foragers to state societies, presented cases relate residential burial to topics such
as ritual reproduction in house societies, social memory, heterarchical and hierarchical social
dynamics, and cultural landscape definition and redefinition.
[69] SYMPOSIUM • VIOLENCE AND CIVILIZATION
Violence (sanctioned or unsanctioned, structural, symbolic or physical) and Civilization are
topics long intertwined in the social sciences. Theorists of the state, from Hobbes to Agamben
have written about the fundamental linkage of violence and socio-political order, while the
notion of “civilization” itself has been both denounced as legitimating, and defended as
reducing, practices of violence. With presentations ranging from Peru to China, this panel will
bring the often striking examples of social violence (such as human sacrifice, slavery and
warfare) found in early polities into a broader discussion of their relationship to social, political,
and even civilizational orders.
[70] SYMPOSIUM • BETWEEN THE SIERRA AND THE SEA: ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN
SINALOA, MEXICO
The state of Sinaloa remains as one of the least studied and poorly understood areas of
Mexico. Yet, this region has also been identified as essential to our understanding of the
northwestern expansion of Mesoamerican societies, as well as the southernmost extension of
traditions generally considered associated with the southwestern U.S., and is especially critical
to debates regarding long-distance interaction and integration between these two superareas.
This symposium presents current research of virtually all those involved in the archaeology of
Sinaloa, with themes ranging from prehistory, the Jesuit missionization, to the 19th C.

[73] SYMPOSIUM • RÍO GRANDE TO ROSILLO PEAK: REDISCOVERING THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF
TEXAS' BIG BEND
An intensive research program of survey and excavation has recently been undertaken by the
Trans-Pecos Archaeological Program (TAP) of the Center for Big Bend Studies at Sul Ross
University in Alpine, Texas, to document prehistoric and historic human adaptation to the
Chihuahuan Desert. Recent data from numerous sites has yielded data from Archaic,
Formative, Protohistoric, and early Spanish occupations. In addition, several rock art sites,
displaying local petroglyph styles, have been investigated. Prehistorically speaking, the
emerging picture is one of a long-lived and successful foraging adaptation to the arid and often
harsh Big Bend country.
[74] SYMPOSIUM • MESOAMERICAN JADE STUDIES
Greenstone and jade are cultural constructs involving a variety of green colored rocks.
Jadeites, serpentinites, schist, and gneisses were significant materials. This session examines
three recent areas of jade and greenstone studies: (1) the geological, mineral, and chemical
characteristics of greenstone in Mesoamerica; (2) the social meaning of jade in religion,
historical processes, its cultural biographies; and (3) the productive processes involved in the
quarrying of raw material and manufacture of greenstone items. This symposium represents
the preliminary base for an upcoming series of conferences in which jade-bearing regions and
their exploitation are compared around the world.
[75] GENERAL SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGICAL CERAMICS
[76] SYMPOSIUM • INKA ARCHITECTURE OF POWER: A REDEFINITION
In 1980, Graziano Gasparini and Luise Margolies published their seminal work entitled Inka
Architecture. The authors grouped Inka buildings into three categories one of which is "The
Architecture of Power". They define Inka Architecture of Power as public works which they
extend to everything built under state direction. This session aims to narrow down this
definition based upon new archaeological data and recent theoretical discourse. Papers
discuss newly excavated public structures, their pre-Inka prototypes, new insights into the
functions of long known buildings, as well as methodological issues of how to identify function
and theoretical questions of architecture and power.

REPORTS FROM THE EXCAVATIONS AT KENAN TEPE
After seven years of research in the Upper Tigris River region of southeastern Turkey
members of the Upper Tigris Archeological Research Project (UTARP) are completing
excavations at the multi-period mound of Kenan Tepe. This panel will present preliminary
analyses of various categories of data that are emerging from this important site.

[79] SYMPOSIUM • A BRIDGE OVER TROUBLED WATERS: IS THERE ANY USE IN A NORTH-SOUTH
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIALOGUE?
Traditionally, the archaeology of hunter-gatherers in South America emphasized the
similarities with North American hunter-gatherers, and disregarded their differences. The
labels used in North American sequences that were applied to South America masked the
diverse array of South American hunter-gatherers. Recent studies have strongly criticized this
bias and are now stressing those differences. However, comparisons are useful and can raise
a series of interesting questions and discussions. Is an articulation between the North and the
South possible, or even fruitful? This session attempts to address this question by contributing
papers from both North and South American archaeologists.

[80] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHEOLOGIES OF URBANISM IN TEXAS
Historical archeology is critically positioned to articulate with urban studies to reveal patterns
of race, class, gender roles, poverty, housing, labor, infrastructure, etc. This session will
explore the peculiar manifestations of urbanism in Texas through a look at some of the ways
that historical archeology has contributed to an understanding of urban social history. Papers
will explore a range of topics that historical archeologists have been working on and
archeology’s role in those narratives. It will also explore how historical archeologists who work
in Texas cities articulate with local descendant communities and the benefits and challenges
such interactions can bring.
[81] SYMPOSIUM • PERSPECTIVES ON THE GRADUATE SCHOOL EXPERIENCE
(SPONSORED BY SAA WOMEN IN ARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP)
What are the challenges faced by graduate student teachers and what resources are available
to them? Is gender an issue in graduate school completion rates? Do some universities exert
pressure channeling women into specialized sub-fields of archaeology? These are some of
the topics present in this symposium, showcasing facts, experiences, and strategies of women
in graduate school.
[82] SYMPOSIUM • SIPAPUS, SINKHOLES, AND SHRINES: NEW APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF
RITUAL CAVE USE IN SOUTHWESTERN ARCHAEOLOGY
For over a century, archaeologists have recognized the ritual use of caves in the Greater
American Southwest. Nonetheless, cave archaeology in the region has generally neglected
ritual and focused instead on chronology, the peopling of the New World, and the recovery of
well-preserved perishable assemblages. Current scientific investigations suggest that
Southwestern cave activities were, in fact, ritual, and are directly comparable to the growing
corpus of data on Mesoamerican cave use. Moreover, the study of ritual cave use has
profound implications for issues as important as our understanding of settlement patterns in
the region.
[83] SYMPOSIUM • SEATED? FLEXED? EAST? WEST? RECENT RESEARCH ON TIWANAKU
MORTUARY PRACTICE IN COCHABAMBA, BOLIVIA AND MOQUEGUA, PERU
In the late first millennium AD, the highland Tiwanaku civilization expanded through migration,
colonization and cultural hegemony to dominate two maize-producing lowland regions on
opposite sides of the Andes: the intermontane valleys of Cochabamba, Bolivia and the Pacific-
draining Moquegua Valley of Peru. To each region, the Tiwanaku diaspora brought with it a
new set of burial practices that was both characteristically Tiwanaku, yet highly diverse. This
symposium brings together recent mortuary research from these two mirror regions to
compare mortuary practices and address questions of migration, local emulation, social
organization and diasporic identity in an early expansive state.
[84] SYMPOSIUM • ADVANCING REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGY IN THE DISCOVERY, ANALYSIS,
AND PRESERVATION OF CULTURAL RESOURCES
(SPONSORED BY NPS NCPTT ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRESERVATION TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH
CONSORTIUM)
As the pace of construction development continues to impact cultural resources, the need for
effective and efficient methods of archaeological feature discovery, definition, and analysis
becomes increasingly imperative. Recent advances in remote sensing technologies integrated
with computer support and processing systems are discussed from the perspectives of
research, efficiency, effectiveness, and economics. Mitigation and preservation activities
benefit from the acquisition of remote sensing data; these serve as analytical data, but also
form digital 3D models of vanishing sites. These “discovery phase” technologies enhance the
planning and implementation of archaeological research and enrich the interpretation and
preservation of the archaeological record.
[85] SYMPOSIUM • CURRENT INITIATIVES AND PROPOSALS ABOUT PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY IN
HONDURAS
National State agencies and foreign academic institutions doing archaeological research in
Honduras have marginalized community outreach and public educational programs in
archaeology. Recently, local governments, communities, and indigenous groups have
challenged the State´s control of cultural resources. The papers in this session explain how
archaeologists are working with Honduran communities interested in using heritage to build

archaeological data to understand past environmental processes.
[86] SYMPOSIUM • ECOLOGICAL FOOTPRINT OF EARLY AGRICULTURAL SOCIETIES: INTEGRATING
ON-SITE AND OFF-SITE RECORDS
The beginning of agriculture greatly increased the potential of human communities to modify
their natural surroundings. However, early human landscape transformations are often difficult
to identify solely from off-site records such as lake pollen cores. Likewise, it is difficult to obtain
a picture of human impact on the landscape from on-site environmental data due to the
cultural filter and lack of off-site provenence. In this session we explore ways to compare and
integrate on-site and off-site records to obtain a more holistic picture of the ecological footprint
of early agriculturalists in different landscape contexts worldwide.
[87] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM • EXPLORING REGIONAL VARIATION IN PREHISTORIC MINES AND
QUARRIES
(SPONSORED BY PREHISTORIC QUARRY AND EARLY MINES INTEREST GROUP)
This symposium will examine the evidence for regional variation among prehistoric mines and
quarries: geological constraints and cultural assemblages will be explored. The form and
structure of extraction loci will be considered to establish whether there was a discrete
regional type. Complimentary themes such as extraction process, refinement sequence, chain
of operation, presence / absence of evidence for ritualisation or tribute and off-site use-
histories of artefacts crafted from mined materials will provide insights into regional and supra-
regional variability (geographical regions rather than modern political boundaries will be used).
[88] WORKING GROUP • INKA IMPERIAL EXPANSION
Early studies considered the Inka empire as monolithic and characterized dominated by a
strong central government. More recently, numerous scholars have begun to examine the
extent, nature and strategies of Inka control and hegemony throughout their empire, and the
relationship between the Inka and supposedly conquered and incorporated other ethnic
groups. These analyses have utilized a variety of theoretical perspectives, including without
limitation, world systems and territorial, “hard” and “soft” boundaries, public demonstrations of
control over labor (Ogburn 2005a), performance and semiotics, and wealth and staple finance.
Such studies have demonstrated enormous diversity in the relationship between the Inka and
other ethnic groups within their purported borders. This working group will consider various
case studies that examine Inka imperial strategies and the relationships among the Inka and
other ethnic groups, with a strong focus upon archaeological data. What are the material
correlates of different expansive strategies? What are the strategies being employed by other
ethnic groups encountered by the Inka-resistance, submission, cooperation? How do these
strategies and their interplays change through time and space? The working group will seek to
address these questions in order to develop a better and more nuanced view of the empire
and its constituent parts.
[89] POSTER SESSION • THE GAULT SITE, TEXAS: RESULTS OF THE TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITY
EXCAVATIONS
This symposium presents the results of the analyses of materials recovered from the area of
the Lindsey Pit at the Gault site in 2000 and 2001. Located in central Texas, this
quarry/campsite was occupied by people from Clovis times until European contact. While most
of the artifact analyses concentrate on the two stratigraphically separate Clovis components, a
few incorporate materials from later periods. Geoarchaeological analyses of the stratigraphy
and microstratigraphy within the Lindsey Pit also are presented.
[90] POSTER SESSION • RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE AREAS SOUTH OF CHACO
Several ongoing projects have been examining the nature of Chacoan and post-Chacoan
developments and society in the areas south of Chaco Canyon. Posters in this session report
on aspects of this empirical research, exploring themes of regional articulation with Chaco,
Chacoan ideology, community organization, and patterns of production and exchange. We
also explore Chaco’s touch, across space and time, looking to distant regions for the echoes
of Chaco in the Mimbres, Zuni and Mesa Verde regions, and to contemporary Pueblo people’s
perspectives on Chacoan and post-Chacoan sites, archaeological research, and the
importance of landscapes.

ON PUEBLO III COMMUNITIES
There is a unique opportunity to study extant Ancestral Puebloan architecture at Mesa Verde.
Unlike the surrounding community, there has been very little human impact to these sites
since they were first put under National Park Service protection over 100 years ago. For the
past 10 years, Mesa Verde National Park's Archaeological Site Conservation Program (ASCP)
has been collecting detailed architectural information aimed at addressing theories regarding
intra- and inter-site movement and social connections. This poster session will highlight recent
studies on Pueblo III communities and discuss the future direction of data collection methods.
[92] POSTER SESSION • NEW RESEARCH ON EASTER ISLAND
The remote and tiny island of Rapa Nui (Easter Island) has long been famous for its
monumental statues and architecture. The spectacular nature of the record has resulted in
popular accounts that interpret the past simply as a function of these monuments. New field
and laboratory research challenges popularized accounts and provides empirical evidence
that can be used to rethink some of the orthodox views about the island's prehistory. In this
session, we present the results of recent research on the history of colonization; architecture;
statue quarrying; settlement patterns; artifact composition; rat populations; and human genetic
variability.
[93] POSTER SESSION • CURRENT RESEARCH IN SAMOA
Over the past century, archaeological research in Samoa has contributed to the investigation
of economy, social stratification, settlement, subsistence, and technological innovation in
Polynesian chiefdoms. Intended to complement the symposium Current Research in
Polynesia, this poster symposium presents recent archaeological research in Samoa.
Investigators will report on current studies concerning the production, distribution, and
consumption of lithic and ceramic technology, landscape archaeology, settlement and
subsistence, and the interpretation of archaeological assemblages through ethnoarchaeology.

Current research in Mexico provides insights into the development of social complexity from
the Preclassic to the Late Postclassic. The papers included in this session attest to the
articulation of theory and practice to study the variations of complexity focusing on stratified
societies in the central valleys of Mesoamerica. This symposium illustrates the
multidimensionality of complex societies through analyses dealing with agency, craft
production and specialization, settlement hierarchy, regional interaction and sociopolitical

[102] SYMPOSIUM • FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY: DEFINING ITS STRUCTURE & APPLICATIONS
The term “forensic” is instantly recognisable but is often subject to wild misinterpretation
thanks largely to its recent media exposure. Forensic archaeology as a discipline aims to
provide an application of archaeological method and theory to criminal investigations;
however, other sorts of investigations ranging from human remains recovery, war crime
investigation, and ancient fingerprints have also been dubbed as forensic archaeology. The
goal of this symposium is to bring a better understanding of the “forensic” in forensic
archaeology. By evaluating the research presented can we better define forensic
archaeological practise and application? How should degree courses addressing forensic
archaeology be structured and what does the future hold for career prospects? Speakers from
a wide range of backgrounds and research interests shall contribute their experiences and
opinions to the debate.
[103] SYMPOSIUM • RITUAL BEHAVIOR AND DISPLAYS OF POWER AT EL PERÚ-WAKA
Excavation, survey and epigraphic analysis demonstrate the extensive Maya site of El Perú-
Waka' was of considerable political and ritual significance. Data indicate occupation from the
Middle Preclassic through the Terminal Classic, and suggest ruling elite and sub-royal elite
groups exhibited their power through displays of wealth, prestige and performance. This is
evident through the layout of the site; the emphasis on built landscapes and mortuary
monuments; the creation of sacred performance spaces; and both violent and reverential
termination of monumental structures. The varying meanings and expressions of ritual
behavior and displays of power will be explored.

[105] SYMPOSIUM • THE LAND CONVEYANCE AND TRANSFER PROJECT: A WINDOW INTO THE PAST
Los Alamos National Laboratory is located on the Pajarito Plateau of north-central New
Mexico. This symposium will present the results of a four-year excavation project which was
conducted in order to transfer lands to Los Alamos County. The project encompassed 8000
years of human occupation on the Plateau, ranging from Archaic campsites, to Coalition
period roomblocks to Jicarilla Apache campsites. The papers will focus on an array of topics
including geomorphology, paleoclimate, hunter-gatherer archaeology, ceramic technology,
subsistence, agriculture and architectural studies. It therefore provides a rare and detailed
view of the archaeology of the Pajarito Plateau.

[107] SYMPOSIUM • HOUSEWORK: SPECIALIZATION, RISK, AND DOMESTIC CRAFT PRODUCTION IN
MESOAMERICA
This symposium examines the structure, diversity, and scale of domestic craft production in
Mesoamerica. It explores four important questions: 1) How was domestic craft production
organized? 2) How were domestic craft specialists integrated into the political economy? 3)
Did social context influence the manufacture of utilitarian and/or prestige goods in domestic
settings? 4) Do the concepts of full- and part-time specialization help or hinder our
understanding of domestic craft production? Symposium participants investigate these issues
using a combination of archaeological, ethnohistoric, and experimental approaches. The
session examines the importance of independent craft specialization in the prehispanic
Mesoamerican economy.

cave archaeologists have demonstrated that data from ritual cave sites are integral to
interpretations of pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican political and social organization. The number of
cave studies has steadily grown, along with the range of topics that these studies inform. This
symposium brings together investigators involved in ongoing research of Mesoamerican ritual
cave use, incorporating approaches utilizing iconography, ethnoarchaeology, pre-Columbian
writing, landscape studies, and the archaeology of religion.
[109] SYMPOSIUM • INTER-REGIONAL INTERACTION IN BRONZE AGE CHINA AND EURASIA: A
MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
Until recently, research on inter-regional interaction in Bronze Age China has focused mainly
on stylistic studies of pottery and bronzes. With new discoveries, changing perspectives, and
increasing use of regional surveys and sourcing, we can begin to develop more detailed
pictures of interaction and flesh-out models initially proposed by Kwang-chih Chang and Su
Bingqi. The panel is both “multi-disciplinary”, incorporating perspectives of art historians and
epigraphers, and “multi-centered”, with scholars discussing new discoveries and fieldwork
within and beyond the traditional core of Chinese civilization, including North, Southwest,
Southeast and Central China, and other regions of Eurasia.

(SPONSORED BY SAA PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE)
Public archaeology - and archaeology itself - is being transformed by new technologies, by
archaeologists working in the margins, and by publics pushing/pulling archaeology to move
beyond its traditional definitions and purposes. This session will explore developments taking
place on the borderlands of public archaeology. These include new art/archaeology interfaces,
promotional marketing for education and fund-raising, organizational strategies to grow
audiences, and the hermeneutic advantage in the newest communication mediums.
Participants will share the developments that excite them now, and, just as importantly,
comment on the implications that these aspects of practice have for the profession's
development.
[112] SYMPOSIUM • ACROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE IN NATIVE NORTH
AMERICAN SOCIETIES, A.D. 1400-1850
Over the last 30 years, anthropologists, historians, economists and other scholars have shown
that the outcomes of colonial interaction between Europeans and Native North Americans
were determined as much by indigenous cultural practices, many of which were established
long before the arrival of Europeans, as they were by the ambitions of colonists.
Archaeological research comparing precolonial and colonial economic, social, and political
practices therefore plays a central role in understanding the worldwide impacts of European
colonial expansion during the last five centuries. The participants in this session use
archaeological data to trace continuity and change in indigenous societies.

Management programs have been responsible for a variety of unique projects and
management approaches. Exploring data management through GIS, consulting with Native
Americans in unique ways, investigating historic and prehistoric sites, and applying new
models to improve site prediction and understanding of the past are just a sampling of various
ARNG projects. This symposium presents a summary of various activities carried out in the
management of our Nation’s historic resources.

APPROACHES TO MORTUARY ANALYSIS (PART 1 OF 2)
Of the biological absolutes that shape human existence, few are more powerful than death.
Investigations into the evidences of death have long been pursued in archaeology as a way to
approach past cultural experience. Mortuary remains, once thought merely to reflect the
identity of the deceased, are now considered an active and creative element of social life,
engaging and encompassing the human and material worlds. This session will explore recent
innovative approaches to mortuary studies with insights from a wide body of data, including
ceramics, human skeletal remains, jewelry, spatial analysis, and others.
[116] SYMPOSIUM • HONORING LINDA CORDELL: SOUTHWESTERN SYNTHESES, COLLABORATIONS,
AND PUBLIC OUTCOMES (PART 1 OF 2)
Linda Cordell has been instrumental in framing Southwestern archaeology over the past
several decades. She has written outstanding syntheses for professional and public
audiences, and worked with international colleagues to bridge the U.S.-Mexico border. In
addition to studying the past, Linda Cordell has been an advocate for contemporary Native
peoples, especially in her role as a museum director. Drawing inspiration from her work, the
participants in this session present papers that reflect the breadth of Linda Cordell's
scholarship from regional syntheses to international collaborations to the public outcomes of
archaeology.

In recent years the number of American institutions engaged in archaeological research in
South Asia has steadily increased. The papers in this session introduce recent research that
has been carried out in South Asia – in particular, the Indian subcontinent. Drawing from a
diverse array of methodological and theoretical perspectives, the participants in this session
will present the results from recent excavations, surveys, and collections research projects.
This panel is the first of a two-part session and focuses on prehistoric time periods.
[118] FORUM • HERITAGE TOURISM AND ARCHAEOLOGY - CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES
(SPONSORED BY ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION)
What is the public importance of the story that archaeological resources can tell? What are the
benefits and costs associated with making archeological resources available for heritage
tourism? These are a few of the questions this forum will explore in the context of the Preserve
America initiative and Executive Order 13287, which call for Federal leadership in the
preservation and use of the nation’s heritage, and which provide ideal vehicles for the
promotion of archaeological information to the public. Given that the majority of archaeological
excavations in the US are conducted pursuant to Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, and much of it with public funds, interpretation and tourism programs are
crucial in providing the public with a return on its archaeological investment.
[119] SYMPOSIUM • INDIGENOUS STORIES ON THE USE AND CARE FOR CULTURAL COLLECTIONS
(Sponsored by Committee on Museums, Collections and Curation and Indigenous Populations
Interest Group)
The impact of NAGPRA on archaeological collections' research accessibility and use has been
discussed extensively. What has not, is the increased involvement of indigenous peoples use
of cultural material by identifying their location and creating access. As a result, elders have
shared various stories including their powerlessness to stop the removal of ancestral remains
and not knowing their eventual location to the recognition of a grandmother's basket design.
These connections are crucial to understanding the current value and meaning of these
collections. This session explores how these stories, from the museum and tribal perspectives,
creates a brighter future.

[121] WORKING GROUP • QUARRIES, MINES, FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS: STANDARDIZING
NOMENCLATURE FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY (PART 2 OF 2)
(SPONSORED BY PREHISTORIC QUARRY AND EARLY MINES INTEREST GROUP)
An international working group of anthropologists, archaeologists and geologists convened at
the 2006 SAA meeting in Puerto Rico to initiate the classification and clarification of the vast
nomenclature that has evolved in prehistoric quarry and early mine research. Differences and
similarities of the terms quarries, mines, factories and workshops were discussed, along with
usage implications, how usage includes certain archaeological sites and excludes others and
the importance of such terms. The recommendation of the 2006 working group was to develop
a glossary of terms that will be published in peer-review journals for distribution to the
anthropological and archaeological community-at-large and standardize a prehistoric quarry
and early mine nomenclature. To date, scholarly discussion has ensued, via electronic bulletin
boards, on how to best qualify the terms quarries, mines, factories and workshops. The goal of
a second working group at the 2007 SAA meeting in Austin is to review the progress of
glossary construction and start to contour the shape of the glossary by grouping terms into
subtopics; such as regional standards, architectural types (surface vs. subsurface), raw
material types (metallic vs. non-metallic) and cultural variations. Special consideration should
be given to terminology in branch sciences such as field and mapping geology, where
geologic variables play a significant role in the delineation of quarry nomenclature.

COOPERATION
(SPONSORED BY SAA COUNCIL OF AFFILIATED SOCIETIES)
The SAA recognizes the importance of avocational and professional cooperation in our
discipline. Many state and local groups have long traditions encouraging and celebrating the
public archaeology aspects of amateur and professional associations. These partnerships
enrich traditional research projects by bringing fresh perspectives and providing the public with
hands-on opportunities to make tangible contributions to the field of archaeology through site
stewardship and training programs, data recovery projects and preservation efforts. This
symposium celebrates the “power and potential of cooperation” by highlighting just a few of
the many successful projects and programs undertaken by avocational/professional
organizations across the U.S.
[124] POSTER SESSION • BUILDING ARCHAEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE USING BINFORD'S FRAMES OF
REFERENCE
The posters in this symposium each begin with environmental or ethnographic variables from
Binford’s frames of reference used to explore variability in some realm of archaeology.
Analytical strategies include using projected ethnographic variables in conjunction with
paleoclimatic models to anticipate site structure, using projected mobility variables to explore
patterns in the manufacture and use of lithics, and using environmental frames of reference to
explore herd composition and milk processing strategies among pastoralists. Continuing
research efforts to anticipate variability in agricultural dependence and in the distribution of
archaeologically documented cooking features and artifacts related to clothing manufacture
are also included.
[125] POSTER SESSION • THE TANO ORIGINS PROJECT: LANDSCAPE, CONFLICT, AND
TRANSFORMATION IN THE GALISTEO BASIN
The rich archaeological record of the Galisteo Basin has been the subject of intense
archaeological interest for nearly a century. Despite this, however, we have a very poor
understanding of the origins of Ancestral Pueblo settlement in the region. The Tano Origins
Project, begun in 1999, has focused on Burnt Corn Pueblo and the associated cultural
landscape, emphasizing the Pueblo III/Coalition Period. Five field seasons of survey and
excavation with associated analyses have provided unique insights into the Ancestral Pueblo

[126] POSTER SESSION • WHAT HAPPENED AFTER AD 1000? RECENT RESEARCH IN THE UPPER
OHIO WATERSHED
For the past six years, students and faculty primarily from Indiana University of Pennsylvania
have been investigating post AD 1000 sites in the Upper Ohio River drainage of west central
Pennsylvania and adjacent areas. New data have been generated through field school and
CRM projects, through the analysis of lithics, ceramics, faunal and floral materials, through the
application of geophysical and spatial technologies, and through a program of radiocarbon
dating of known village sites. This combination of traditional and new methods promises to
add much to our understanding of the post AD 1000 cultures in this region.
[127] POSTER SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE RESPONSE TO CATASTROPHE
Catastrophic events are occurrences that can result in dramatic change and innovative
responses by people and societies. Understanding human response to catastrophes requires
that archaeologists be able to accurately identify and date catastrophic events and associated
archaeological phenomena, as well as articulate the consequences of such events on
particular aspects of societies such as political institutions, subsistence economies, or sacred
places. The impacts of catastrophes may vary tremendously as may the responses of social
groups. Using case studies from the Americas and Africa, posters in this session illustrate
archaeological approaches to catastrophes and their consequences.
[128] POSTER SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE SANAK BIOCOMPLEXITY PROJECT
The Sanak Biocomplexity Project is a multidisciplinary research effort funded by the National
Science Foundation to investigate the long-term history of the North Pacific. The underlying
thesis of the project is that the Aleut have been harvesting the region for over 10,000 years
and thus, have engineered many of the complex dynamics between the Aleut and other
marine and terrestrial species in the region. While the project integrates mathematical
modeling, ecology, oceanography, social anthropology, and other disciplines, this symposium
presents a range of archaeological and paleoecological results from this project in relation to
findings from the greater research efforts.
[129] POSTER SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGICAL THEORY AND METHOD
[130] FORUM • ETHICAL ISSUES IN ARCHAEOLOGY: PERUVIAN PERMITTING AND THE ETHICS FORUM
(SPONSORED BY REGISTER OF PROFESSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGISTS)
The RPA forum again will be partitioned into two sections. The first section of the forum will
present, for discussion and comment, an MOU among the Peruvian government and the
Register of Professional Archaeologists outlining the guidelines for fieldwork permitting of
American archaeologists wishing to practice in Peru. The second part of the forum will provide
the SAA membership an opportunity to continue the discussion of topics debated during the
Ethics Bowl. Topics likely to be discussed include professional behavior in and outside of the
U.S., indigenous archaeology, repatriation, and consultation.
[131] SYMPOSIUM • HONORING LINDA CORDELL: DEMOGRAPHIC, SOCIAL, AND IDEOLOGICAL
PERSPECTIVES ON POPULATION MOVEMENT (PART 2 OF 2)
Linda Cordell has shaped discussion of population movement in the North American
Southwest for the past three decades. Her early work on abandonment and migration in the
Mesa Verde region influenced how we understood site and regional scale movements. Her
later overviews addressed processes and explanations for movement at different scales.
Cordell's intensive studies of Pueblo IV and historic settlement in the northern Rio Grande
have provided models for explaining village and regional population movement. This session
builds on the legacy of Cordell's work by considering demographic, social, and ideological
aspects of population movement in the American Southwest.
[132] SYMPOSIUM • CONFOUNDING CATEGORIES AND CONCEPTUALIZING COMPLEXITIES
North American archaeologists face an interesting problem. Given an increase in data, it is
more difficult to fit our research into categories and subcategories. We have too many details
to be satisfied with generalizing typologies. Even seemingly simpler hunter gatherer societies
prove to be more complex than older models can explicate. Recent discussions of ideas such
as historicity, hierarchy, hegemony, centrality, alliance building, migration, memory,
monumentality or identity formation move beyond the categorical, and provide specific ways to
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 72nd ANNUAL MEETING                                                      19
investigate how people constructed complexities. Papers in this symposium explore ways of
thinking about complexity in North America, and the implications of such thinking for our
understandings of the past.
[133] SYMPOSIUM • BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO THE EVIDENCE OF DEATH: CONTEMPORARY
APPROACHES TO MORTUARY ANALYSIS (PART 2 OF 2)
Of the biological absolutes that shape human existence, few are more powerful than death.
Investigations into the evidences of death have long been pursued in archaeology as a way to
approach past cultural experience. Mortuary remains, once thought merely to reflect the
identity of the deceased, are now considered an active and creative element of social life,
engaging and encompassing the human and material worlds. This session will explore recent
innovative approaches to mortuary studies with insights from a wide body of data, including
ceramics, human skeletal remains, jewelry, spatial analysis, and others.
[134] GENERAL SESSION • THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF EUROPE
[135] SYMPOSIUM • RECENT RESEARCH IN SOUTH ASIAN ARCHAEOLOGY: PROTOHISTORY AND
HISTORICAL PERIODS (PART 2 OF 2)
In recent years the number of American institutions engaged in archaeological research in
South Asia has steadily increased. The papers in this session introduce recent research that
has been carried out in South Asia – in particular, the Indian subcontinent. Drawing from a
diverse array of methodological and theoretical perspectives, the participants in this session
will present the results from recent excavations, surveys, and collections research projects.
This panel is the second of a two part session and focuses on protohistoric and historic time
periods.
[136] SYMPOSIUM • TAKING THE CAMINO REAL TO SCHOOL
(SPONSORED BY SAA PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE)
The SRI Foundation, through grants from the New Mexico Bureau of Land Management and
the New Mexico Office of Cultural Affairs created, "La Gran Aventura! El Camino Real Tierra
Adentro". This educational unit, in conjunction with Project Archaeology’s "Intrigue of the Past:
A Teacher’s Activity Guide for Fourth through Seventh Grades", formed the base for three
workshops along the Camino Real—two in New Mexico and one in Mexico. This session will
highlight the development and execution of an international preservation education program
with the Instituto Chihuahuenes de la Cultura, Chihuahua, Mexico.
[137] SYMPOSIUM • KHONKHO WANKANE AND BEYOND: RECENT RESEARCH IN THE MACHACA
REGION OF BOLIVIA
Ongoing research in the Machaca Region of Bolivia is shedding critical new light on long-term
prehispanic cultural development in the high south-central South American Andes. Machaca
occupies an environmental and cultural frontier between the Lake Titicaca Basin, to the north,
and the dry central altiplano to the south. Research in Machaca ties together regional survey,
excavation, and analysis at and around the Late Formative ritual-political center of Khonkho
Wankane. Archaeology at other regional sites provides comparative perspective that helps
flesh out the cultural processes and environmental shifts behind profound long term changes
in the Titicaca Basin.
[138] GENERAL SESSION • THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SOUTHWEST U.S.
[139] FORUM • LOOKING FOR COMMON GROUND: TECHNICAL AND ANALYTICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN
THE SOURCING OF MESOAMERICAN CERAMICS
Recent spectrochemical studies of Mesoamerican ceramics have illuminated past social and
economic interactions from the Early Formative through the Colonial era. Such work affords
unique opportunities for studying both long-term patterns of local pottery manufacture and the
emergence of new centers of production and distribution. Mexican and U.S. investigators
engaged in these studies follow distinctive protocols in ceramic source analysis, based on
Particle-Induced X-ray Emission analysis and Instrumental Neutron Activation analysis
respectively. This forum brings together physicists, archaeologists, and geologists from both
countries to exchange ideas and explore new avenues for collaboration.

[140] SYMPOSIUM • DEBATING WITH ROBERT: THE CAREER AND LEGACY OF R. S. SANTLEY
The vigor with which Robert S. Santley (1948-2006) pursued knowledge of the past
constitutes an important part of his intellectual legacy. This symposium honors the signature
Santley-argumentative-flair, which few could match, through presentation of current research
and reflections inspired by debates with this prolific and provocative scholar. Mirroring the
diverse methodological and topical interests of Robert Santley, participants explore key issues
in survey and sampling techniques as well as topics of political economy, ecological systems,
and political organization ranging across Mesoamerica and North America at the scale of
households to macroregional systems of the past and present.
[141] SYMPOSIUM • TEN YEARS SINCE NASHVILLE: ASSESSING THE FIRST DECADE OF
MESOAMERICAN CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY
The self-conscious subdiscipline of Mesoamerican cave archaeology coalesced out of a
session held at the 1997 Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology in
Nashville. In the following decade, eight additional sessions have been held as the new
subdiscipline rapidly professionalized and achieved visibility within archaeology. This session
explores the historical events leading up to the emergence of the field and assesses
development during the decade from 1997 to 2007.
[142] GENERAL SESSION • EASTERN NORTH AMERICA
[143] SYMPOSIUM • NEW PERSPECTIVES ON ANCIENT MAYA ASTRONOMY
(SPONSORED BY MAYA EXPLORATION CENTER)
Far more than just investigations of ancient science, studies of ancient Maya astronomy have
profoundly aided our understanding of the Maya worldview. Maya concepts of time and space,
meanings encoded in religious art, intentions underlying architectural alignments, and even
methods of political legitimization have all been illuminated through the study of Maya
astronomy. Six years after the seminal Maya astronomy symposium at the 2001 SAA
Meetings, it is time to present the new perspectives and discoveries in ancient Maya
astronomy that have resulted in the interim from ongoing studies of architectural alignments,
codices, epigraphy, iconography, ethnography, and calendrics.
[144] SYMPOSIUM • ETHNIC AMBIGUITY IN AFRICAN HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR AFRICANIST ARCHAEOLOGISTS)
Africanists have become increasingly sensitive to the fluidity of social boundaries and ethnic
constructs in the past and present. This has prompted skepticism about the possibility of
studying ethnicity in the archaeological record. Material landscapes, however, embody forms
of social experience that may shed critical light on the depth and salience of ethnic identities in
precolonial Africa. This session will examine how Africanist archaeologists can grapple with
the "ambiguity" of ethnicity. Authors are invited to draw on specific case studies and explore
how material patterns can illuminate - or challenge - our knowledge of processes of cultural
identification in the African past.
[145] SYMPOSIUM • HISTORICAL ECOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE: MULTI-SCALAR PERSPECTIVES ON
THE COURSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF AGRARIAN LAND USE
Proper management of our planet’s agricultural landscapes is critical for maintaining a
successful and sustainable relationship between humans and the environment. However,
agricultural impacts on the socio-natural environment operate on multiple scales, where on
many levels, human activities enhance the landscape for agricultural purposes at the expense
of degradation and diminished biodiversity across time and space. Bringing together research
from across the globe, this symposium explicitly examines issues of scale as they relate to
historical ecology, agricultural landscapes, sustainability, and the role humans play in altering
the evolution of local, regional, and global socio-natural environments.
[146] SYMPOSIUM • IDENTITY AND COLONIALISM IN CALIFORNIA, 1769-1848
In the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, California came under the control of
European colonial forces. During this period, local populations underwent profound changes in
demography, material culture, settlement patterns, ritual practice, and social and political
organization. These changes are traditionally understood as a consequence of European rule,
but indigenous life in the Colonial period was neither uniform nor entirely reactionary. In this
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 72nd ANNUAL MEETING                                                       21
session we ask how indigenous California communities navigated the colonial experience as
active agents. Using archaeological, ethnographic, and historical data sets, we address how
indigenous peoples reformulated their identities, materially and symbolically, in the Colonial
period.
[147] SYMPOSIUM • STRATEGIES OF INTEGRATION AND ADMINISTRATION IN THE SOUTHEAST MAYA
AREA: A CASE STUDY FROM THE EL PARAÍSO VALLEY, HONDURAS
While much has been done to examine political organization within Classic period (AD 200-
900) Maya polities, the mechanisms of polity integration and administration remain
understudied. Recent research in the El Paraíso Valley, Honduras, sheds light on the
administration of one such polity, the Classic Maya kingdom of Copan. Recent
multidisciplinary research demonstrates that the valley was administered from two markedly
different centers in the Classic period; El Cafetal was a seat of local power while El Paraíso
extended Copan control into the region. This dual-center model is contextualized through
comparisons with administrative strategies employed elsewhere in the region.
[148] SYMPOSIUM • NATIVE AMERICAN IDENTITY IN THE MARKET ECONOMY, 1775-1850
This symposium attempts to bridge the divide between an archaeology of early historic periods
(ca. 1500-1750), investigating connections between historic Native American groups and pre-
contact cultures, and an archaeology of later periods, dealing with European settlement,
industrialization, and urbanization. We focus on the period 1775 to 1850, and the associations
between Native Americans, the market economy, and modernization. The expansion of
European migration dramatically altered the social, economic, and demographic landscapes
for Native groups across the continent. How did Native Americans negotiate the often-
contradictory challenges of adapting to rapid social and economic changes and maintaining
group identity?
[149] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM • CERAMIC EXCHANGE AND STYLISTIC INTERACTION AMONG THE
ANCIENT MAYA
Many assessments of ancient Maya interaction among sites and zones rely on the comparison
of ceramic styles and the identification of imported ceramics. Physical characterization of clays
and slips and stylistic classification can provide information about (and help differentiate)
ceramic exchange and stylistic interaction, but each presents theoretical and methodological
challenges. In this symposium we’ll discuss problems and prospects for the identification of
ceramic exchange and stylistic interaction among the ancient Maya. Although the presentation
of new ceramic data is included, participants also discuss methodological and theoretical
issues in their papers.
[150] GENERAL SESSION • EXPERIMENTAL ARCHAEOLOGY
[151] SYMPOSIUM • CENTRAL AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY: CURRENT SITUATION AND FUTURE
PERSPECTIVES
(SPONSORED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY)
Many research projects take place in Central America. However, few are known to the
worldwide community because they are carried out by the official local institutions responsible
for protecting the cultural patrimony. This symposium will examine archaeological research
from Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama, as well
as future perspectives. Papers will present legal issues and official expectations on how
foreign archaeologists should interact with national authorities. Academics will discuss their
experiences. The papers will touch on ways in which the national and international
communities could work together improving the flow of information on the research being done
in Central America.
[152] SYMPOSIUM • PATHWAYS TO POWER
There are few larger questions in the prehistory of our species than the emergence of social
inequality. Social inequality, the basis of hierarchical structure of human society, is manifested
in unequal access to goods, information, decision-making and power. This structure is
essential to higher orders of social organization and basic to the operation of more complex
societies. Understanding of the transformation from relatively egalitarian societies to more
hierarchical organization is fundamental to our knowledge about the human condition. This
symposium examines some of the mechanisms, forces and motivations involved in the shift in
human societies from egalitarian to hierarchical.

[153] FORUM • DIVERSITY AND CHANGE: DISCUSSIONS ON FUTURE NEEDS AND CHALLENGES FOR
ARCHAEOLOGY
As archaeological practice becomes increasingly diverse and global, expanding beyond its
traditional core within the academy, the SAA faces a variety of challenges to the ways in which
it addresses the needs of its constituents. This collaborative forum seeks to problematize the
idea of the SAA as a more inclusive and representative body and through a constructively
critical lens discuss concerns and potential implications on practice and policy of the
organization. Discussants include members of several of the SAA's standing committees,
providing a variety of experience-based perspectives.
[154] SYMPOSIUM • RITUALS IN US CAVES, ROCKSHELTERS, AND SINKS
Caves and rockshelters are customarily treated as temporary shelters for male hunters or
family units. Site reports for some caves and rockshelters have evidence for rituals. Inspired
by a decade of work in Mesoamerica, this symposium was created to highlight cave rituals and
even ritual caves in the US and to stimulate future work on rituals and a sacred landscape.
Participants take a look at US caves, rockshelters, and sinks in California, Montana, northern
Plains, Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee to uncover evidence of burial
programs, human sacrifice, rituals with dogs, birds, ocher, shells, glyphs, shrines, and birth.

[157] SYMPOSIUM • HEALTH, DIET, AND GENETIC AFFINITY IN A CHACO ERA COMMUNITY
The Point Community, an extensive Chacoan small house community, flourished near
Farmington, New Mexico, during the Pueblo I to Pueblo II periods. This symposium presents
the results of recent research on human skeletal remains from this community, excavated on
private land over 30 years ago. The Tommy Site, a Pueblo I/II small house, had a sample
population of 117 individuals, while the Mine Canyon Site, dating to the Pueblo III period, had
a sample of 45 individuals. Our research includes a demographic study, a description of the
paleopathology present at the two villages, and craniometric, bone chemistry, and DNA
analyses.
[158] SYMPOSIUM • APPROACHING DARWIN'S BICENTENNIAL: THE STATE OF THE ART IN
EVOLUTIONARY ARCHAEOLOGY
Regarding science is approaching to Charles Darwin’s bicentennial birthday and the 150th
anniversary of the first edition of "Origin" it’s an adequate moment to revise the current
perspective in the application of evolutionary theory in archaeology. The symposium main
objective is to show how is today’s impact of Evolution in a variety of topics and analytical
scales. The Symposium presents a spectrum of examples and case studies in different world
regions, dealing with scenarios such as sociopolitical hierarchy, artifact phylogenies, cultural
transmission processes, and human dispersal and migration routes.
[159] SYMPOSIUM • LATE PLEISTOCENE AND HOLOCENE PALEOECOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY AT
THE RICHARD BEENE SITE, COASTAL PLAIN, SOUTH-CENTRAL NORTH AMERICA
Archaeological and paleoecological studies at the Richard Beene site, on Texas’ inner Gulf
Coastal Plain near San Antonio, revealed 15 m of overbank alluvium, a 30,000 year-old
ecological record, hints of mammoth-bone quarrying, and remains of 20 distinct hunter-
gatherer encampments spanning 10,000 years. Geomorphic studies and carbon isotope
analysis of paleosols, land snails, and river mussels indicate considerable climatic fluctuations.
The site’s lithic and feature assemblages are comparatively homogeneous, as are its meager
faunal and flora records. Overall, site structure and land-use strategies remained fairly stable
through time, with a decidedly woodland orientation.
[160] SYMPOSIUM • RECENT CARIBBEAN COLLECTIONS RESEARCH AT THE PEABODY MUSEUM OF
NATURAL HISTORY, YALE
The Peabody Museum of Natural History maintains one of the world's largest and most
comprehensive collections of Caribbean archaeological material. While most of these
collections were acquired between 1930 and 1975 during research focused on culture history,
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 72nd ANNUAL MEETING                                                        23

topics. These collections are also the focus of new analytical methods. The papers in this
session report the results of recent research on Peabody Museum collections from the
Caribbean region.
[161] SYMPOSIUM • THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECOGNITION OF MARKET PLACES: VIEWS FROM THE
MAYA LOWLANDS
The economic signature of market exchange has been recognized as a trait of pre-Hispanic
Maya society for decades, but the actual location of market places remains elusive.
Researchers using various methodological approaches have recently identified what may be
market locations in several Maya centers, both large and small. The methodologies used
blend different approaches, from traditional analyses of architecture and artifact distributions to
micro-artifact studies and soil chemistry tests. This symposium brings together some of this
new information to help define future research strategies for recognizing and documenting
market places among the Maya and, potentially, in other cultural contexts.
[162] SYMPOSIUM • CONVERSATIONS FROM CAMPECHE: COMMEMORATING WILLIAM J. FOLAN'S
CONTINUING CONTRIBUTIONS TO MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY
William J. Folan has worked in the field of American Archaeology for over half a century. He is
best known for his research in the Maya area at sites like Dzibilchaltun, Coba, Calakmul, and
Champoton as well as his support of Maya ethnography, environmental studies, and historical
archaeology. We bring together scholars who have benefited through collaboration with Folan
since the 1950s. Papers address work in archaeology, ethnography, bioarchaeology, and
environmental research, with a discussants' section designed to allow field reminiscences and
personal recollections in tribute to Folan’s ever-growing legacy as a visionary in the field of
Maya studies.
[163] SYMPOSIUM • CERAMICS, MOBILITY, AND INTERACTION IN LATE PREHISTORY
Some residentially mobile groups in North America used ceramic vessels, especially within the
crowded landscapes of late prehistory. These groups, who were often near or surrounded by
sedentary, food-producing, ceramic-using populations, had different opportunities and
constraints than the earliest adopters of ceramics on the continent. Ceramic assemblages
from sites in interaction zones may shed light on territory, mobility, and adaptation to new
physical and social environments as well as the exchange of goods, information, and people.
We address these topics using case studies from the United States, including the Northwest,
Southwest, Great Basin, Great Plains, and Great Lakes regions.
[164] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY, CULTURAL RESOURCES, AND BEYOND: FORT HOOD'S
CONTRIBUTION TO CENTRAL TEXAS CULTURAL RESOURCES
Fort Hood, a U.S. Army training installation located in Central Texas, is home to 2236
archaeological sites. For over 25 years, Fort Hood has maintained an active Cultural Resource
Management program, employing both traditional investigative techniques and modern
technologies to produce a wealth of data and knowledge concerning the peoples that once
occupied the lands of Fort Hood, both prehistorically and historically. This knowledge has
contributed greatly to our general understanding of the archaeology and cultural resources of
Central Texas. The papers in this symposium represent many aspects of the contribution Fort
Hood's CRM program has made to the region.
[165] SYMPOSIUM • CURRENT AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN THE PALEOINDIAN ARCHAEOLOGY OF
THE GREAT PLAINS AND SOUTHWEST
The Great Plains and Southwest have played a key role in the writing—and rewriting—of
North American Paleoindian archaeology. Many classic sites come from this area, and the
pioneering interpretations drawn from them continue to guide current thought. On the 80th
anniversary of the Folsom discovery, it is time to take stock of Paleoindian research in the
region, to see where it has been, where it stands, and where it might be going. These papers
build on the legacy of Plains and Southwest Paleoindian research by reporting new sites and
analyses, and by advancing, and sometimes questioning, received wisdom.
[166] SYMPOSIUM • THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS OF HUNTER-GATHERER
POTTERY STUDIES
Hunter-gatherer pottery has been amply documented globally in the archaeological record.
, 24                                            ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 72nd ANNUAL MEETING
Archaeologists use pottery as a tool to understand hunter-gatherer diets and settlement
patterns, among other topics. Study of hunter-gatherer pottery has produced fertile theoretical
work concerning human social organization, the organization of technologies, and the nature
of technological change. Hunter-gatherers face a different suite of constraints and issues than
agro-pastoral societies when making and using pottery and often arrive at novel technological
adaptations that are only rarely discussed in the archaeological literature. This session
highlights recent theoretical and methodological approaches in hunter-gatherer ceramic
research in a variety of regions.
[167] SYMPOSIUM • CURRENT RESEARCH IN POLYNESIA
Archaeological research has shown that Western Polynesia was settled first around 1000-900
B.C. Current thinking is that subsequent migrations from Western Polynesia led to the
settlement of Eastern Polynesia between 500 B.C. and A.D. 1000 (though this continues to be
studied and debated). The archaeology of the island nations is diverse, and recent studies are
explaining the rapid changes that took place on each island after colonized. This symposium
reports recent archaeological work in Polynesia. Investigators report on current studies of
cultural change, innovation, elaboration of production and exchange, landscape archaeology,
and cultural exchange within and beyond Polynesia.
[168] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM • THE END OF THE BEGINNING: EXPLAINING THE FINAL YEARS OF
THE MESOAMERICAN PRECLASSIC
Strong traditions of regional research sometimes obscure broad patterns across
Mesoamerica. This session focuses in particular on the concluding years of the Preclassic, in
regions as diverse as the Yucatan Peninsula, West Mexico, Central Mexico, the Gulf Coast,
and Oaxaca. Similar shifts, even convulsions in some places, point to the need for a
comparative survey that evaluates the reasons for those shifts, the forces influencing them,
and the continuities that endure across such divides. Some presenters will present on a
specific region, exploring and defining the Preclassic to Classic transition there, while others
will present on pan-Mesoamerican topics.

Public outreach and education are increasingly becoming important components of Northeast
research and compliance projects. Public programming, whether in an academic or cultural
resource management context, provide an important opportunity to inform the public about the
importance of archaeology and stewardship of the archaeological record. However, the
dissemination of information and incorporation of diverse constituencies in archaeological
projects is not without its limitations. The papers in this symposium discuss recent public
outreach efforts in the Northeast and the challenges in conveying information about
archaeology to the public.
[171] SYMPOSIUM • GIS AND REMOTE SENSING TECHNOLOGIES IN HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
GIS and remote sensing technologies have become well-established as part of the
archaeology toolkit. These technologies have arguably had the most impact in archaeological
research focused on pre-Contact periods, often emphasizing predictive modeling and cultural
ecological analyses. Papers in this session present recent substantive and methodological
research in historical archaeology, highlighting a broad range of applications for the subfield.
Current research presented points out not just greater use of these technologies in historical
period research, but also an emerging depth of impact in terms of analyses that go beyond
baseline mapping.
[172] SYMPOSIUM • THE DIGITAL EXCAVATION: APPROACHES TO RECORDING, REPOSITORY AND

A vast majority of today’s excavation and survey projects use some form of digital recording,
be this a spreadsheet, database, GIS, digital photography or other applications. Digital
recording, analysis and publication have enormous potential, but at the same time generate
their own problems. The purpose of this session is to outline the challenges and promises at a

IN HONOR OF BARBARA VOORHIES
During four decades of research in Mesoamerica, Barbara Voorhies has overseen numerous
projects in Guatemala, Chiapas, and Guerrero. Her interest has focused mainly on Archaic
period lifeways along Pacific coastal Chiapas, but she also has conducted research on a
range of other issues. Voorhies is noted for her scientific rigor, her ecological approach, and
her effective use of ethnographic data to bring life to the past. Voorhies’s students and
colleagues have been inspired by her approach to archaeology, her enthusiasm for fieldwork,
and her love of Mesoamerica. We pay tribute to her continuing work in this symposium.
[179] FORUM • THE DISCIPLINE OF ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY)
A discussion of the status of academic archaeology. This is an intellectual, a practical, and an
emotional issue. Autonomy represents a major sea change for our discipline in the United
States and one that requires careful thought and protracted discussion. Our reactions to the
question come from inner feelings, colleague relationships, pedagogical inclinations,
intellectual needs, and anticipated costs and benefits. The goal of the symposium is to
consider as many aspects of autonomy, and its consequences, as possible. Our format
includes a panel of discussants followed by questions and discussion with the members of the
audience.
[180] SYMPOSIUM • THE MATERIAL SIGNATURES OF NONHUMAN AGENCY
Recent social theory challenges an anthropocentric view of societies and human social
networks, arguing that such perspectives do not reflect the primacy others place on daily
interactions between human and non-human agents. Following ethnographic evidence they
note that supernatural beings are active participants in the social worlds of many present and
past peoples. Artifacts, architecture, natural places, and other objects are often animated
beings imbued with agency. As active social participants, supernatural agents are involved in
human interactions that leave discernable traces in the archaeological record. This session
explores material, methodological, and theoretical implications of the agency of spirits.
[181] SYMPOSIUM • NEW LIGHT ON THE THIRTEENTH-CENTURY DEPOPULATION OF THE NORTHERN
SOUTHWEST
The northern Southwest experienced an unparalleled depopulation during the thirteenth
century that coincided broadly with perturbations in regional climate regimes. Some recent
research, however, has questioned whether climate change was a causal factor. This
symposium brings together the latest paleoclimatic data (including current understandings of
climatic processes) with the latest archaeological research to assess the effects of climate
change on the northern Southwest’s demography at local and regional scales, with emphasis
on the Mesa Verde region. The results suggest that climate played a critical role in the
regional depopulation, but perhaps not in the way that is usually supposed.

promise for explaining the timing, manner of dispersal, and observed archaeological patterns
at continental scales, this field of study remains in its infancy. Progress in this field of study will
be made through the presentation of new information, the dissemination of stimulating ideas,
and the exchange of fresh insights and perspectives.
[185] SYMPOSIUM • RUINS STABILIZATION IN THE NORTH AMERICAN SOUTHWEST: KEEPING THE
WALLS FROM TUMBLING DOWN
(SPONSORED BY NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, VANISHING TREASURES INITIATIVE)
In 1891, the first ruins preservation project in the North American Southwest was initiated at
Casa Grande in Arizona. Since that time numerous significant historic and prehistoric ruins
have been preserved with a bewildering array of stabilization techniques, some of which have
been more detrimental than helpful for long term preservation. In this symposium,
archeologists and stabilization experts from multiple parks throughout the region evaluate the
long-term effects of prior stabilization techniques, identify current preservation technologies,
and describe recent documentation practices, including laser scanning and GIS mapping, in
an effort to develop a more consistent methodological approach.
[186] SYMPOSIUM • THE WARI AND THEIR DESCENDANTS: IMPERIAL TRANSFORMATION IN CUZCO,
PERU
Recent archaeological investigations in Cuzco, Peru, provide new insights into the
transformation from Wari provincial imperialism to regionalization and the eventual rise of the
Inca state. Research results support a Wari cultural tradition perpetuated into the Late
Intermediate Period as manifested by the Lucre culture. This session presents papers
addressing this socio-political transition as evidenced by the following: militarism and political
strife suggesting Wari imperial decline; continuity in Wari and Lucre ceramic fabrication,
architectural construction, and funerary practice; and archival records linking Lucre to the
Pinagua and Muyna, ethnic groups, which among others, formed the fabric of Inca imperial
society.
[187] SYMPOSIUM • EXCAVATION AND WEB APPLICATIONS: REAL TIME LINK BETWEEN RECORDING
AND PUBLICATION: DIGITAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT ANCIENT URKESH (PART 2 OF 2)
A distinctive recording/publication system has been developed for the Urkesh excavation, a
large urban site in Northeastern Syria. Based on rigorous theoretical principles, it provides a
seamless integration of all levels of analysis. The result is a real-time link between the very
first observation of stratigraphic/typological attributes and the final online publication, as a
browser edition. Each daily input acquires an immediate published status, against which the
ongoing strategy of excavation can accurately measure itself. The various papers illustrate the
theory, give hands-on demonstrations of codes and programs, explain the structure of the
resulting browser edition.

[189] SYMPOSIUM • PORTS, POLITIES, AND POLITICAL ECONOMIES: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE
ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF TRADE IN THE ANCIENT MAYA LOWLANDS
Assessing the institutional organization and physical operation of both long-distance and local
trade in the Maya lowlands has proved deeply problematic. Much of our knowledge is based
on limited data sets, and too few inter-project comparisons are being made. The purpose of
this symposium is to bring together researchers working throughout the Maya lowlands and to
provide a forum for the discussion of new perspectives on ancient trade. For this session,
trade is broadly defined to embrace all varieties of nonviolent transaction and should be
understood to include both local systems and larger regional networks.
[190] SYMPOSIUM • GAULT SITE, TEXAS: CONTEXT AND RAMIFICATIONS OF ONGOING RESEARCH
Investigations at the multicomponent Gault Site in Central Texas from 1991-2002 documented
and recovered more than 1.2 million artifacts and established their contexts. This symposium
presents intermediate results from ongoing analysis of artifacts and new data regarding site
context. Data regarding Clovis, Late Paleoindian, and Archaic lifeways at Gault are presented.
Special attention is given to regional and continental implications of these data.

[191] SYMPOSIUM • XENOPHILE: THE ALLURE OF THE EXOTIC
Exotics mark archaeological sites across time and space. Non-local goods were transported,
traded, and exchanged through myriad means, over short and long distances. Archaeological
tools for identifying foreign objects, such as provenance studies, stylistic analyses, and
economic documentary sources reveal non-local materials in prehistoric and historic
assemblages. Yet trade and exchange encompass more than mere production and
consumption. Exchange was a mechanism for introducing the foreign into daily life, and the
sources of alien objects surpass archaeological expectations of exchange and geographic
distance. Foreign objects were integrated into everyday practice long before the advent of a
global economy.
[192] SYMPOSIUM • A NEW LOOK AT A COMMON DILEMMA: PERISHABLES AND THE DEFINITION OF
BOUNDARIES. A SESSION IN MEMORY OF JAMES PETERSEN
(SPONSORED BY SAA FIBER PERISHABLES INTEREST GROUP)
Boundaries can occur at all levels of social organization, between broadly defined interaction
spheres or between households within single villages. Perishables, especially textiles, are
shaped by the complex array of learned behaviors that are transmitted within such bounded
social groups. Therefore, perishables are especially useful to explore how material culture
traditions are established and maintained, how they reflect broader aspects of their cultural
context, and how their boundaries are shaped. The papers in this session will explore these
concepts in more detail.
[193] SYMPOSIUM • IMPERIAL INSPECTIONS: ARCHAEOLOGISTS, WAR, AND VIOLENCE
Archaeologists in many parts of the world work at the edges of war and violence. Western
archaeologists often ignore complex politico-ethical issues that emerge in such contexts. Our
discussions cannot be limited to theoretical reflections, but must also engage at the level of
praxis, including the choice of sites, research questions and publication strategies. In a world
of highly unequal international relations, neither indignant withdrawal nor opportunistic
adaptation to politically problematic conditions is acceptable. This session forms part of a
larger discussion that aims to develop a politically aware ethics of archaeological praxis.
[194] SYMPOSIUM • INTER-VALLEY RELATIONS IN THE CENTRAL MEXICAN HIGHLANDS:
DEVELOPING COMPARATIVE AND DIACHRONIC PERSPECTIVES
Recent studies on the inter-valley relations in the Central Mexican Highlands from the
Formative to Postclassic periods are presented to better understand the trajectories of social
changes through comparison of material culture, exchange relationships, socio-political and
urban-rural relations. These studies examine the nature of interactions among different valleys
including Valley of Toluca, Tula, Tlaxcala, Cholula, Morelos, and Basin of Mexico. Topics
include demography, subsistence, archaeometry, biogeochemical analysis, ceramics, lithics,
and architecture. The format encourages broadly based inter-regional sharing of current ideas,
methods, and approaches and promotes further research in the Central Mexican Highlands.
[195] SYMPOSIUM • ISLAND ZOOARCHAEOLOGY: SYNERGY AND SYNTHESIS
Zooarchaeologists working on islands are united by special challenges and issues that form a
basis for a disciplinary community of island zooarchaeology. Despite these shared interests,
analytic findings often fail to transcend geographically bounded research areas (eg.
Caribbean, Polynesia). This symposium facilitates dialogue and collaboration between
practitioners by bringing together zooarchaeologists from diverse island regions to explore
research developments, novel contributions, and new lines of inquiry and to promote the
synthesis and advancement of island zooarchaeology as a subdiscipline. Contributions
address issues bearing on larger questions in zooarchaeology and island archaeology,
emphasizing island zooarchaeology’s importance to understanding past cultures.

The Animas - La Plata (ALP) reservoir project facilitated the intensive archaeological
investigation of a large geographic area in the northern Southwest. This area was used by a
number of temporally defined groups, including Archaic, Basketmaker, early Pueblo, Ute, and
historic Euroamerican groups, each of whom constructed vastly different cultural landscapes.
This symposium presents the major findings of these investigations with particular focus on

[197] SYMPOSIUM • MESOLITHIC MEETS ARCHAIC: HUNTER-GATHERER RESEARCH ACROSS THE
ATLANTIC DIVIDE
This session focuses on the archaeological evidence on the small scale societies in temperate
Europe and North America during the Early and Mid-Holocene. Themes explored are hunter-
gatherers' local social and economic dynamics, regional and interregional interaction with
other groups including the role of different scales of population movement in the formation of
the Archaic and Mesolithic archaeological record. An attempt is made to evaluate approaches
to the study of hunter-gatherers and early food producers in European and North American
archaeology, explore the causes of commonalities and differences in these approaches, and
highlight their potential in future research.
[198] SYMPOSIUM • RITUAL AND REPRESENTATION AT TEOTIHUACAN: INTERDISCIPLINARY
APPROACHES
Teotihuacan was a city designed for procession and public gathering. Its massive central
pyramids and plazas, reflected in more intimate settings and on a smaller scale, indicate the
importance of ritual in every aspect of life. The nature of these rites is less clear, however, and
has most often been interpreted by analogy with much later Aztec rites. The papers in this
session bring together recent discoveries and new forms of analyses, and consider
archaeological findings, textural evidence, and artistic imagery. Together they explore the
relationship between ritual, ritual depiction, and the nature of sacred space in Teotihuacan.
[199] GENERAL SESSION • ARCTIC AND SUBARCTIC ARCHAEOLOGY
[200] SYMPOSIUM • COLLECTIVE MEMORY IN MIDDLE AMERICA
Memory is an essential part of constructing the present. People situate themselves in a
plethora of social contexts by referencing the past. As demonstrated by recent work on the
“Past in Past,” we know that many references to the past can be manifested materially and in
a variety of contexts. The objective of this session is to explore ideas such as how
archaeologists can access collective versus individual memories, as well as how
Precolumbian cultures constructed, erased, negotiated, and contested memories in material
form, in a broad Middle American context.
[201] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGISTS AS GATEKEEPERS OF NATIVE AMERICAN AND NATIVE
HAWAIIAN IDENTITY
(SPONSORED BY SAA COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN RELATIONS)
US and Canadian archaeologists find themselves embroiled in conflicts over identity. Laws
and public opinion have traditionally empowered anthropologists as the authorities on
indigenous identity. More recently, Native Americans and Hawaiians have challenged this
authority and asserted the right to establish their own identity. They often embrace oral history
and tradition in opposition to archaeology as “data” for determining identity. These conflicts
have real consequences in debates over repatriation, land claims, and government
recognition. This session examines the rights and autonomy of indigenous people in
determining their own identity and the role of archaeologists as gatekeepers in legitimating
that identity.
[202] SYMPOSIUM • MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY IN BELIZE
This symposium represents a cross-section of current work by both established and emerging
scholars from Canada, England, and the United States, whose research is based on the
archeological investigations of ancient Maya sites in Belize, Central America. Individual
research papers vary widely, including materials-based studies, bioarchaeological and isotopic
analyses, investigations into intra- and inter-site variation, trends in socio-political change,
ideological representation, and ritual practices. The papers in this session contribute
substantial insight into the lives of the ancient Maya who once made the country of Belize their
home and provide archaeological data for all Maya researchers.

[203] SYMPOSIUM • THE WEIMER RANCH COLLECTIONS AND THE GATEWAY DATASET: MAKING
SENSE OF FORMATIVE DEVELOPMENTS ON THE NORTHERN ANASAZI PERIPHERY
The Weimer Ranch Collections consist of archaeological data from several west-central
Colorado sites that were excavated in the 1970s. These collections, which were never
analyzed, represent the Gateway Tradition (A.D. 900-1200), a poorly understood Formative
development north of the Four Corners region. Fortunately, the Weimer Ranch materials were
recently analyzed under the direction of Alpine Archaeological Consultants, Inc., providing new
information on the Gateway phenomenon. This symposium highlights the contributions that
the Weimer Ranch Collections have made towards understanding local, and perhaps inter-
regional dynamics pertaining to this relatively unknown chapter of Colorado prehistory.

AMERICA THROUGH HISTORICAL, CULTURAL, AND TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVES
Raising and draining wetland fields, resulting in characteristic rectilinear patterned ground
formations, has long comprised an agricultural strategy in Latin America. Once viewed
primarily in the theoretical context of hydraulic societies, previous and ongoing research
demonstrates the need to understand these field systems in broad historical and cultural
perspectives. This session applies a number of approaches to studying raised and drained
field systems, including paleoenvironmental reconstruction, exploring linkages with adjacent
settlements and political centers, documenting geotechnical processes underlying field
formation, the place of patterned ground formations in landscape histories, and efforts to
conserve and preserve both relic and still-active complexes.

Paleolithic research in the Japanese Archipelago, which first started in 1949, now has more
than half a century of history behind it. Although the disgraced “Fake scandal” (revealed in
2000) distorted the notion of the Japanese “Early and Middle Paleolithic”, a rich and reliable
Upper Paleolithic archaeological record has been continuously documented and investigated.
The purpose of this session is to provide the significant results of recent investigations of the
Paleolithic record across the archipelago to the public and an international scholarly audience.

ARCHAEOLOGY ILLUMINATE THE PAST
Contract archaeology on both sides of the Atlantic generates a wealth of archaeological
material while posing considerable challenges in terms of how we use all these bits and pieces
to make meaningful representations of the past. How can the full academic value of such
results be realised? How can they improve the future management of the archaeological
resource? And how can the archaeological profession ensure that public benefits justify
continuing expenditure on such work? This session will explore current approaches to the use
of results from contract projects, and open a discussion on what more can be done in future.

on valuable efforts at research and interpretation in a quest for answers to the long list of
questions shared by archaeologists working in the region. Surveys and extensive excavation
extend our understanding of Mixtec urbanism while analysis of domestic contexts addresses
household activities in different socio-economic settings. We give special attention to two of

[212] SYMPOSIUM • NEIGHBORHOOD, COMMUNITY, AND POLITY: ALTERNATIVE INTERPRETATIONS
OF MISSISSIPPIAN SOCIETIES
New models and data are challenging established views of Mississippian organization.
Diverse themes are emerging: the heterarchy of corporate and residential groups, limitations
to tributary or prestige good models of elite economic control, and the constraints on
hegemonic polity models revealed in variable mound-center settlement patterns and histories.
How was group identity, autonomy, or complementary in rituals, relations of production, and
social status materialized within neighborhood, community and polity? Did the built
environment formalize a group's place in the community? Eclectic in theory and method, these
new directions have implications for the archaeology of middle-range societies.
[213] SYMPOSIUM • DIGGIN' THE GOLDEN STATE: RECENT STUDIES IN THE PREHISTORIC AND
HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY OF CALIFORNIA
This symposium traverses time from prehistory to historical times. Various geographic points
in California are considered. The symposium opens with a paper on the challenges and
opportunities the Corps Regulatory permitting process presents to cultural resource managers.
Five papers on prehistoric topics include consideration of material culture, features and issues
such as, for example, nomadism versus sedentism. Another paper examines the transition
from Mexican to American California through analysis of mortuary remains. Two historic period
papers consider late 19 to mid 20 century recreational and residential sites from a cultural
landscape perspective on the suburbanization of the Los Angeles region.
[214] SYMPOSIUM • STRUCTURING ROCK ART "SITE" STUDIES
(SPONSORED BY SAA ROCK ART INTEREST GROUP)
Rock art powerfully organises social and spatial relations. This symposium aims to consider
structures and patterns that persist at multiple scales. This search for structure may help
integrate rock art into the archaeological record as a prominent element: its object of study
ranges from ‘images’, their ‘components’, to the ‘sites’ and ‘landscapes’. The symposium will
further explore if structural exceptions should be interpreted as marginal or individual activities
within systems. Finally, structuring rock art studies requires an examination of its limits and
possibilities and revisits the notion of the rock art ‘site’ as a conventional etic study unit.
[215] SYMPOSIUM • NEW KNOWLEDGE FROM OLD SITES: THE VALUE OF REVISITING SITES AND
THEIR COLLECTIONS
New tools, methods, and ideas offer opportunities to accomplish significant research using
existing collections and previously studied sites. Given the critical preservation decisions
archeologists must make about the value of sites and collections, the question of reanalysis
becomes increasingly important. To what extent does the potential application of new methods
and theoretical perspectives inform the values we assign to the archaeological research of
today? The wide range of papers presented here collectively explores application of new
technology in the field and lab, testing of new hypotheses on old sites, and the potential
contained in existing collections.
[216] SYMPOSIUM • CUSCO BEFORE THE INKAS
Recent research in the Inka heartland of Cusco has greatly contributed to our understanding
of the socioeconomic and political processes that preceded and influenced Inka state
formation. In this session, intra- and inter-site data will be presented in order to explore if and
how the sociocultural and economic practices of earlier polities and local ethnic groups
conditioned the ascendancy of Cusco in the South-Central Andes. The symposium will provide
new insights on Inka political economic development, and more generally, how state formation
is grounded in and influenced by earlier political agendas, cultural practices, and economic
strategies.

SOCIETIES
The participants in this symposium address how market systems developed (or failed to
develop), evolved, and articulated with other, non-commercial forms of exchange in different
times and places in pre-capitalist economies. The symposium is organized around four
principal questions: (1) what are the defining characteristics of market exchange? (2) How do
we recognize market exchange archaeologically? (3) What is the relationship between market
and non-market exchange? And (4) how and under what conditions do market systems
develop and evolve? It is intended to initiate a cross-cultural dialogue and generate new ideas
about pre-capitalist market exchange and the evolution of market systems.

[219] Marketplaces in Middle-Range Societies: A Hohokam Case Study
One question concerning market exchange in pre-capitalist societies asks if marketplaces can
develop in middle-range contexts. And, if so, how can we recognize them archaeologically,
and how are they organized and financed? Among the Hohokam of south-central Arizona,
ceramic provenance and distribution data imply that geographically concentrated production of
commodities and their dissemination to far flung consumers may have been dependent on
marketplace transactions associated with ritual ballgames. In the presence of frequent
ceremonial events that regularly drew large crowds, a heavy dependence on marketplace
barter may have developed among the Hohokam without elite oversight or sponsorship.

surfaces. Geoarchaeological investigations into the nature and development of desert
pavements of the Libyan Plateau therefore provide data concerning the geologic history and
stability of this landscape but also provide context for understanding the taphonomic
processes affecting archaeological materials since their deposition. Assemblage composition
and positioning suggest a highly stable land surface since the Middle Paleolithic, with minimal
transport of deposited materials.

Since its definition over 70 years ago, Fremont’s origin, character, and fate have been broadly
debated. Archaeological interpretation of Fremont has evolved from a “backwoods Anasazi”
culture to a distinct cultural entity, first with two – and later, five – poorly defined regional
variants. Fremont culture has remained elusive due to a lack of universal durable material
culture traits, architecture, land-use patterns, and subsistence strategies. Fremont basketry,
however, is one of the most distinctive varieties in the entire Great Basin and, as such, has the
capability to illuminate what the Fremont may have been, where they came from, and perhaps

[143] Maya Astronomy as an Oracular Science: Thoughts on the Philosophical Underpinnings
of Indigenous Sciences
Ancient Maya astronomy has been investigated from various methodological approaches over
the last century, most of which have revealed technical localized practices. While the rigorous
focused recovery of the practices and elements of Maya astronomy are necessary for
assembling the larger intellectual endeavor, we must also keep in mind that any such
assemblage is dependent on underlying epistemologies, which are precariously subject to
interpretation. In this paper, I propose a few epistemological principles, including a
Mesoamerican desire for stochastic accuracy in prediction, that, along with corroborating
interpretive evidence, makes a case for a Maya oracular astronomy.

[109] Trajectories to Complexity in Pre-Han Southeast China: Gauging the Impact of Inter-
Regional Interaction
The prehistory of China witnessed the emergence of numerous hierarchical societies, which
themselves display different trajectories to complexity. A comparison of a number of pre-Han
archaeological cultures in southeast China allows us to contrast two such trajectories, one
more gradual and extended and the other characterized by a rapid but relatively short-lived
increase in socio-political inequality. It is suggested that these different outcomes are in part
explained by the degree to which the products and benefits of inter-regional interaction (such
as access to prestige goods) are successfully integrated throughout the local system.

through a mixture of persuasion and force. This dialogical relationship continues with regard to
the finished object, which is treated as possessing a kind of agency in its own right. I go on to
discuss the implications of this interactive stance for our understanding of technological styles
and management strategies in the pre-Columbian Andes.

Agricultural intensification and unsustainable land use practices are widely considered
consequences of the development of complex societies and territorial expansion. However, an
alternative explanation is that the tendency toward territorial expansion is a consequence of

employed as a strategy to avoid social collapse over the short-term. These alternative
processes are evaluated for land use and the rise of complex society among the Classic Maya
of Central America, the Bronze Age in Greece, and the Bronze Age in the Southern Levant.

[152] On The Evolution of the Human Capacity for Egalitarianism and Inequality
Most explanations of the origins of inequality focus on overcoming the inertia of egalitarianism,
invoking either systemic processes, such as population growth, or aggrandizers. These
explanations rest on a deep seated assumption that egalitarianism is the default social
organization for small-scale human societies. By implication the roots of inequality are shallow.
More recently, some scholars suggest that in the Late Pleistocene egalitarianism was imposed
on inherited tendencies towards dominance hierarchies, implying the roots of inequality are
deep. Both miss the fundamental point that egalitarianism and inequality in modern human
societies rests on modern human cognition, specifically the capacity to symbol.

[101] Beyond Environmental Determinism and Sociocentrism: Social Responses to
Environmental Changes in the Bronze Age of Mesopotamia and Adjacent Regions
Two mutually exclusive hypotheses are widespread in the studies of interdependences
between nature and society in Ancient Mesopotamia and adjacent areas. One suggests that
no major climatic shift has happened during the last 6000 years, while according to the other
abrupt climatic changes have caused catastrophic declines of ancient societies during the
same period. A new synthesis of the data available from the area allows us to identify several
major phases in the nature-society relationship and analyze adaptation strategies
(imperialization, ruralization, nomadization, migration) from the perspective of the two principal
modes of sociopolitically centralized and decentralized responses to environmental change.

[106] Exploring the Utility of 3D Modeling and Reconstruction in Public Archaeology
Digital reconstructions and 3D models of archaeological sites are powerful educational tools
that can help promote the mission and ethical principles of the Society for American
Archaeology. This paper discusses how interactive geovisualization models within the domain
of public archaeology are useful not only to convey past culture history but also to teach
critical geographic and spatial reasoning skills. A 3D web-enabled GIS model of a temple in
Luxor, Egypt, is proposed as a case-study. The dissemination plans discussed consider
issues involving GIS public participation, assessing model efficacy and usability, and exploring
methods of streaming 3D-GIS models via the Internet.

[69] Warfare and the Creation and Diminution of Social Hierarchy in the Late Prehistoric
Andes
Warfare works in complex ways: useful to leaders and elites, it may also help maintain
egalitarian institutions and communal identities, sometimes simultaneously. For centuries,
Andean elites extended their power through military victories and violent, post-victory rituals.
These traditions ceased in the war-torn Late Intermediate Period, when social stratification
and militaristic ideologies were strongly deemphasized. I argue that people at this time warred
in ways that reinforced anti-hierarchical ideals—through a commitment to autonomy and
through collective defensive and aggressive actions—but also, though less visibly,
undermined them, necessitating war leadership and ranking some households as more
expendable than others.

[206] The Chinampas of Xochimilco-Chalco and Mexico-Tenochtitlan: A Symbiotic
Relationship through History
Late in the 15th Century raised and/or drained agricultural fields covered a major portion of the
Xochimilco-Chalco lacustrine sub-basin. Although this type of agriculture predates the Aztec
Empire, the area under chinampa cultivation underwent rapid expansion during the periods
Aztec III & IV. This paper recounts this process in support of the hypothesis that a symbiotic
relationship existed between the urban area and the chinampa area 30 kilometers away; a
relationship that continued beyond the conquest through the Colonial Period and into modern
times.

[99] Toyah as a Social Field: Defining Hunter-Gatherer Social Identity at a Regional Scale
Toyah represents a widespread, homogenous hunter-gatherer material culture, spanning
approximately 400 years, located between and linked to at least four cultural traditions
(Puebloan, Mississippian, and Mexican agriculturalists and the bison hunters of the plains).
Thus, Toyah was not a single hunter-gatherer social group, but may represent a large social
field of distinct groups inhabiting a large environmentally variable region and participating in a
variety of long distance social relationships including extended kinship systems, exchange
networks, and alliances. This presentation explores the evidence for a Toyah social field and
discusses its implications in terms of defining hunter-gatherer social identity.

[200] The Materiality of Social Memory among Potters in Ticul, Yucatan
This paper explores the way in which potters in Ticul, Yucatan, Mexico, have materialized their
social memory at several different social scales. Specifically, this paper describes those ways
in which social memory is corporately and materially expressed in rituals common the
population of potters: the potters’ gremio organized each year to honor an image of a ‘black
Christ’. This image is associated with the emergence of a unique indigenous Yucatecan
identity in the 17th century, but gremio activities also materially express social class, kinds of
social relations, and serve multiple social purposes for the potters.

[79] Aspects of Early Cultural Diversity in the Argentine Puna that Range ca. 10,600 – 9200
BP
Inca Cueva-4 is an example of an early adaptation to high altitude deserts, with characteristics
that clearly separate it from relatively synchronic occupations assigned to the Paleoindian in
Fuego-Patagonia and central Chile. These characteristics include, among others: a dug-out
habitation floor (pit-house), an external refuse area, storage pits, basketry, cordage made of
vegetal and animal fibers, and rock art. Added to the evidence from other early sites in the
Atacama Desert (Chile) it is clear that there are enough differences to support the existence of
cultural diversity prior to 10,500 BP—greater than the terms Archaic-Paleoindian define.

[39] The Faunal Remains of Bosutswe
Bosutswe, located in southern Africa, was occupied for nearly a millennium (ca 700–1700 CE)
during the Iron Age, providing an ideal opportunity to study changes in animal exploitation over
time. Exploratory data analysis of faunal remains indicates that while the frequency of
domestic animals increased, the frequency of wild game decreased. Examination of stable
isotope data is used to determine past climatic conditions, and suggests differences in the
management strategies of large and small stock animals. The research investigates how
changes in herd management and game exploitation are related to political transformations
that occurred during this time period.

The material objects of death are considered reflections of the deceased’s identity or the result

objects are more than static signs, but active in their own right constitutive of and participating
in social life and having real and tangible reasons, causes, and effects. These new insights
are applied to the objects of dress from graves in Early Dynastic Mesopotamia to demonstrate
that dress is more than society’s covering of the dead, but the means for creating and
sustaining its relationships and social beings, both living and dead.

[165] Data or Dogma: How Different Were Paleoindian Ways of Life on the Plains?
Paleoindian archaeology has long asserted that there is a dramatic break between Early
Holocene and later ways of life on the Plains. However, it has rarely documented empirically
that such a break actually exists. This paper briefly considers Paleoindian and later bison
hunting, settlement patterns, and flaked stone technology with this in mind. Differences are
evident in these domains of behavior, but these are far less pronounced than the literature
suggests.

[41] Explaining Great Houses: Expanding the Archaeological Record at Chaco Canyon with
Comparative Rock Art Analysis
A century of excavation and research studies have used a wide variety of archaeological data
to explore the role of great houses in the larger context of Chacoan social and political
organization. Chaco Canyon rock art is virtually absent from those research efforts despite the
presence of thousands of prehistoric images lining the cliff walls and boulders behind great
houses and small sites. This paper suggests that, far from being a marginal resource,
comparative statistical analysis of great house rock art can determine new information about
great house functions, users, and affiliations.

[74] Mineralogical and Geochemical Studies of the Prehispanic Mesoamerican Jades in
Mexico: A Transdiciplinary Project
In this paper we will show the outline of a new transdiciplinary project conducted by a selected
group of researchers from different institutions. This project will contribute to the analysis of
greenstones in ancient Mesoamerica with a geoarchaeological interface, combining
anthropological and geological methodologies. One of the advantages of the project is the
implementation of non-destructive techniques already installed in Mexican laboratories for the
generation of databases of characterization and provenance of raw materials and
archaeological pieces with the participation of archaeologists for explaining cultural meanings.
The purpose of the project is to provide a reliable database to Mesoamerican archaeological
projects and museums.

[168] Caught Between Community and Polity: the Formative-to-Classic Transition on Pacific
Coastal Oaxaca
We explore the role of social tensions in the collapse of the first centralized polity in the lower
Rio Verde Valley, Oaxaca. Throughout the Formative, local communities remained a primary
locus of social identity. Our research shows that by the Terminal Formative, regional political
authorities sought to engage followers in large-scale social formations. Local elites and non-
elites, however, continued to assert local autonomy and social ties. We argue that tensions
between local and regional scales of social interaction undermined regional political stability
and resulted in the dissolution of the polity at A.D. 250. We consider similar processes in
highland Oaxaca.

[192] Archaic Woven Sandals as a Boundary Marker between the Great Basin and Southwest
Culture Areas
Prehistoric culture areas are defined by consensus around relevant attributes from sites in the
core of the area. Prehistorians agree on the relevance of those attributes at the core. This
consensus decreases towards the periphery because single artifact shapes cross and blur
culture area boundaries. Interloping artifacts are physically identical in both areas but have
different names in each. Interloping lithic tools, ceramics, and basketry blur the boundary
between the Great Basin and the Southwest. However, this is not true of archaic woven
sandals, where they may define an absolute technological boundary between the archaic
Great Basin and the Southwest.

The main ceremonial structures of the El Cafetal site core were the focus of extensive
remodeling throughout the Classic period. In one instance the substructure of Structure 1, the
largest building at the site, was raised more than 3 m in height, suggesting a massive
investment of labor and building materials. In another case, Structure 8, an administrative
space or throne room, was re-oriented 180°, creating new spatial arrangements within the
center. These spatial modifications appear to have coincided with shifts in the political fortunes
of El Cafetal paramounts, possibly reflecting changes in the ability of locals to exercise

throughout the site's period as a populated, civic-ceremonial center. The role of an

conjunction with charred and calcined bone. Spatial data of burned and unburned materials

[13] A Question of Accuracy
Visual treatments in archaeology have many roles: illustration, documentation, conjecture,
visualization, evocation, even inspiration. Each implies distinct meanings, contexts, aims, and
audiences. Illustrations of archaeological date are delimited by what is dimensionally,
scientifically verifiable. But this is merely a beginning, just as the remains themselves are
merely fragments—traces of a world where lives took place and meanings were experienced.
Works of architecture work’ in such a world; and so ‘accuracy’ is problematized: is it ‘accurate’
to the fragments, the works, the experience, or the audience? Our paper considers these
opportunities for multiple ‘accuracies’ in our Ohio Valley ‘Earthworks’ project.

We use extensive water and soils testing to understand aggradation in two broad agricultural

aggradation: in upland bajos by accelerated soil erosion and possibly climatic instability, and in
coastal plain wetland fields by a large flood and a rise in a water table saturated with calcium
and sulfate ions. This latter mechanism is a rarer geomorphic process and an environmental
change that occurred across periods of intensive Maya land use.

[34] Coupling Biological Activity and Geomorphic Processes in Archaeological Site Formation
In archaeology, burrowing organisms are associated with site disturbance, particularly the loss
of stratigraphic integrity. While capable of artifact translocation, fossorial activity, coupled with
geomorphic processes, can also preserve archaeological resources. Additionally, since
suitable habitat for subsurface dwellers is bound by specific ecological parameters, the
intensity of former occupation can indicate past environmental conditions. At a high altitude
site in Wyoming, sediment displaced by Thomomys talpoides, the pocket gopher, is
redistributed into alpine sag ponds, burying cultural material. Research begun in 2006
examines the impact of pocket gopher activity in conjunction with physical processes of
sedimentation on archaeological site context.

By A.D. 700, both sedentary Hohokam agriculturalists and more mobile Lowland Patayan
groups occupied the western Hohokam frontier near Gila Bend, Arizona. Ceramic distributions,

frequent interaction during the period A.D. 700–1100. This might be expected, given
worldwide patterns of interaction and interdependence between groups with visibly different
settlement patterns and economies. In this case, good Hohokam-Patayan relationships may
be related to the eastward movement of some Patayan people and goods after A.D. 1000,
where they were incorporated into Hohokam society during the Classic Period.

[168] Transition and Trajectory: The Late Formative to Classic Shift in the Highland Lakes
District of Central Jalisco
Recent excavations at Teuchitlan tradition sites in the highland lakes district of Jalisco have
shifted the most active periods of trade in exotic goods, intensified agriculture, tomb
construction, and public architectural investment backwards into the Late Formative. But
beginning around A.D. 200, there is a shift in new construction away from large public
architecture in the largest centers to smaller buildings in small to medium sized communities.
The interpretation of this and other changes is anything but straightforward, and both
stabilization and decentralization are possibilities to be evaluated.

[142] Evaluating Occupational Continuity through Taphonomic Analysis
Seven of the over 100 burials at the Engelbert Site contain the remains of more than one
individual. These double burials are clustered in an area interpreted as a Susquehannock
cemetery. Reanalysis of the cemetery has revealed evidence that other Late Woodland
cultures also used this area and that the double burials may contain individuals that were not
interred at the same time. Taphonomic analysis of burial and non-burial contexts, and their
faunal assemblages, seeks to evaluate the contemporaneity of these individuals and assess
their potential to be evidence of a cultural link between Iroquois, Susquehannock, and

[216] Early Intermediate Period and Middle Horizon interaction in the Xaquixaguana Plain,
Cusco
A recent survey in the Xaquixaguana Plain in the Cusco region of Peru identified several Early
Intermediate (AD 200–600) and Middle Horizon (AD 600–1000) sites. Surface pottery at these
sites is local and Cusco-related; Wari ceramics were scarce. Excavations at the largest of
these sites, Ak’awillay, confirm the rarity of Wari and Wari-related material culture. This work

nine volcanoes within the research area, presenting the possibility of multiple sources for tool
stone acquisition. The locations of these quarries remain unknown. To address the problem of

[181] Possible Impacts of Early-Eleventh-, Middle-Twelfth-, and Late-Thirteenth-Century

Three intense and persistent droughts impacted some prehistorical Native American cultures
in the early-eleventh, middle-twelfth and late-thirteenth centuries, including the Anasazi,
Fremont, Lovelock, and Mississippian (Cahokian) cultures. Tree-ring-based reconstructions of
precipitation and temperature indicate that warm drought periods occurred between A.D. 990
and 1060, A.D. 1135 and 1170, and A.D. 1276 and 1297. These droughts occurred during
minima in the Pacific Decadal Oscillation and may have been associated with positive values
of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. Each of the Native American cultures relied on
precipitation-dependent resources which were negatively impacted by multidecadal drought.

indigenous origins, declines in the production of some traditional items, and notable shifts in

native people assigned both ideological and economic value to trade objects. This paper

who are deemed sufficiently co-opted. These structures ensure that the western

The Bureau of Reclamation has funded a NAGPRA affiliation study for skeletal remains and

Utah. The ten claimant tribes include five Numic speaking groups, whose historic range was
roughly coterminous with that of the prehistoric Fremont, and five modern Puebloan groups
from New Mexico and Arizona. An in-depth assessment of multiple lines of evidence yields
equivocal results. It appears that the Numic speaking groups can be eliminated from
consideration as descendants of the Fremont. An argument can be made for common
Fremont and Anasazi origins but the nexus between Fremont and the modern Pueblos,
separated in time by over seven centuries, cannot be demonstrated with any semblance of
specificity. It is quite possible that the field of archaeology, in its current state, lacks the
theoretical and methodological underpinning to address, with credibility, the cultural, linguistic,
and biological connectivity between modern tribal entities and prehistoric groups known only
from material remains.

greater consensus and collaboration between museum staff and Native Americans.
Repatriation has fostered relationships between the Cheyenne and Arapaho Tribes of
Oklahoma and the Smithsonian’s National Museum of Natural History on issues of traditional
care, cooperative agreements on collections, deposition of records into the museum, and
museum assistance to the Cheyenne in the evaluation of repatriation cases.

[205] House of the Living, House of the Dead: Excavation of a Royal Residence at Cerro
Leon, Peru (AD 1–200)
Analysis of room function and the spatial organization of Compound 1, a large residential
structure at Cerro Leon, revealed that the compound was divided into three spheres of
interaction: a private residential area consisting of patios, kitchens, and storage rooms, a
mortuary area associated with communal food preparation, and an area of large terraces for
public performances. Cerro Leon was the paramount site in a cluster of sites occupied by
highland immigrants to the middle Moche Valley, ca. AD 1–200. Within this community,
Compound 1 was the largest residence and was probably occupied by the paramount ruling
family.

[41] Newly Discovered Hunter's Shelter, SE New Mexico: Archaic or Late Prehistoric
Pictographs?
A small (4m by 4m), high cliff-side limestone shelter with three significant red pictograph
panels was discovered in 2005. The Hunter's Shelter contains a centrally located standing
deer or elk, a rare butchering scene of a similar animal, and a complex panel of small figures
(each a few centimeters or less). This unique scene appears to depict hunters holding curved
sticks (one holding a rabbit), nets, rabbits, and dogs. The images have similarities to the Red
Linear Style found in the Lower Pecos River rock art region of Texas as well as to late
prehistoric sites in Southern Colorado.

Conserving heritage sites for future generations to study, appreciate and decide upon is the
primary goal of historic preservation. Remote-sensing techniques allow the present generation
of archaeologists to investigate and make decisions about such sites in a non-destructive
manner. This paper examines how state and federal agencies incorporate remote-sensing
studies into project-specific and long-term planning efforts relating to Sections 106 and 110 of
the National Historic Preservation Act and the factors affecting the adoption of these

selection of what to measure has also been governed by what is easy to measure accurately

those aspects of debitage that should be quantified and evaluated to determine the answers to
certain research questions. Using biface reduction, this poster demonstrates that informed
measurement produces results that are superior to those based in measurements that are

[35] Ceramic Paste Variability in the Mirador Basin: A Regional Perspective
For more than 20 years pottery from the Mirador Basin, Guatemala, has been subjected to
chemical analysis by neutron activation as new materials or questions emerged. In the interim
the data set has grown to several hundred paste analyses. In this paper we offer an overview
of some of the major compositional patterns present in the data set. Both Preclassic and
Classic period ceramics are considered and are discussed relative to similar analyses carried
out on ceramics from near by sites, such as Calakmul, thereby placing the Basin in a regional

[194] The Changing Patterns of Maize Preparation in Central Mexico
Evidence of maize preparation in the Teotihuacan Valley, Mexico, shows at least two major
shifts consistent with greater levels of intensification. However, the complexity of synchronic
variability in maize preparation there obscures diachronic patterns, and for certain periods the
available evidence remains too sparse for safe characterization. To clarify how maize
preparation changed this paper considers the results of recent analyses of grinding tools from
other parts of the Basin of Mexico and nearby regions of northern Tlaxcala and Hidalgo and
attempts to clarify how maize preparation changed over time in Central Mexico.

[46] Compositional Characterization of Colonial Oaxaca Tin Opacified and Lead-Glazed
Earthenwares
The Spanish conquest and colonization of New Spain caused many changes in the indigenous
ways of life, including ceramic technology and style. To monitor some of these changes, we
have undertaken an extensive program of chemical characterization of tin opacified and lead
glazed earthenwares, distinctive patterns of ceramic paste and glaze recipes to determine
what pottery was made at what location, and to characterize the changes in manufacture that
reflect different economic and social changes that occurred in the northern Spanish-Mexican
frontier. In this paper we focus on glazeware production in Oaxaca, viewing it relative to other
identifiable sources in New Spain.

[205] Ritual Life in a Domestic Setting: Household Excavations at the Northeast Group, Chan,

This paper will examine archaeological definitions of sacred/profane and how it is used within
Maya household archaeology. Linguistically and ethnographically, houses and architectural
features, such as hearths are described as representations of the Maya Universe.
Archaeologically however, such features are interpreted in strictly utilitarian terms.
Excavations in 2005 at the Northeast neighborhood group, part of the site of Chan, Belize,
identified a stone-lined hearth and possible ritual deposit in association with the household’s
kitchen. The recovery of both ritual and domestic features within the same setting suggest that
archaeological definitions of sacred/profane are considerably more complex than previously
imagined.

Canajaste, a Late Postclassic Maya settlement located on the Lagartero River in Chiapas,
Mexico, is marked by a 200 m-long stone wall cutting off the site center from the surrounding
countryside. This imposing feature suggests that the town’s inhabitants were preoccupied with
defense. Excavated buildings in the town center revealed evidence of multiple burnings,
indicating repeated attacks. Hundreds of obsidian arrow points found at the site reinforce this
interpretation. In the absence of ethnohistoric documents, the archaeological record suggests
that this site was located in a contested frontier zone—probably representing the colonial
expansion of a neighboring state.

[154] The Sky Above, the Mud Below: Landscapes of Mississippian Rock Art
Archaeologists have long acknowledged that late prehistoric people in the Southeast
recognized a three-tiered interconnected cosmos that juxtaposed a celestial upper world with
a subterranean underworld. However, because of a longstanding excavation emphasis on
dramatic and easy to find surface sites, the nature of underworld (cave) use and its relation to
surface sites has not been determined. Through chemical analysis of prehistoric pigments
used in rock art, we can establish direct relationships between surface and subterranean sites,
indicating that Mississippian rituals were themselves multi-tiered, embedding ceremonial
resource procurement in geographically dispersed activities that occurred in open and in cave
contexts.

[152] Collective Action and Inequality in the Evolution of Complex Societies
While no known complex society is socially egalitarian, it is still the case to fully understand
the evolution of inequality we must address the expression of egalitarian behavior that, for
example, can limit the agency of a governing elite. Anthropological archaeology, with its focus
on processes bringing about domination and political centralization, has failed to accomplish
this. I suggest that the rational choice theory of collective action is a potentially useful
explanatory framework that will help us move in new theoretical directions.

Excavations at North Storr’s Lake, San Salvador, Bahamas, yielded 1300 fragments of

and ethnographic records, the role of the sea turtle in Lucayan culture is investigated.
Zooarchaeologists typically categorize sea turtle to the family level, but this raises the issue of
which Cheloniidae is represented in the archaeological deposits: green turtle is culturally
preferred; loggerhead has been recovered elsewhere on San Salvador; hawksbills inhabit the
waters of San Salvador today. Recent stable isotope and DNA analyses reveal the identity of
the archaeological sea turtle recovered from North Storr’s Lake.

[212] The Termination of Mound X at Moundville
Mounds commemorated and sanctified a social segment's place at Mississippian centers. The
plan of Moundville's mound-plaza group is said to reflect the ranked social order of a rapidly
planned community. Mound X lies just outside this formal arrangement and predates it. Mound
X was terminated and abandoned when a palisade was built over it at the time the mound-
plaza group was established. If the built environment formalized a social segment's place in
the community, then the Mound X termination appears to be a rejection of membership. Efforts
to memorialize group claims through mound building could be challenged and erased.

tested are that intensification of agriculture of maize was developed to solve problems of
population pressure. In this scenario the technology of raised fields developed either to
provide a surplus appropriated by emergent elites or to be used by wealthy families to create
more wealth to attract followers.

Separately, these measures are not especially robust indicators of processing intensity, but
together they can be informative, provided that other aspects of taphonomic history are

also considers what the disappearance of native pipes post-1750 reveals about Native efforts
to maintain their identity during this period.

Group in Ohio also suggest that migration and gene flow accompanied the cultural exchange
between Hopewell communities in Illinois and Ohio.

aimed at capturing summer floods. The relative abundance of farmland sustained such
practices throughout the period. Contour terraces and canals capable of diverting and
distributing the scant baseflow developed much later, in part as an adaptation to the severely
degraded landscape left behind by Formative farmers.

revisit arguments for the role of the highlands in the development of lowland polities, and
stress the idea that highland polities were more than contributors/controllers of raw materials
for developing lowland elites.

identify technological aspects of pottery manufacture. The combination of multiple approaches
to ceramic analysis produces a more holistic understanding of Copper Age Europe and allows

[56] Middle and Later Stone Age Occupations in a Late Pleistocene Terrace at Erfkroon, South
Africa
Recent excavations at Erfkroon document MSA and LSA components spanning the last
160kyrs. Erfkroon consists of a number of dispersed occupations in a donga (gully) complex
that is actively eroding Late Pleistocene terraces on the Modder River in the western Free
State. Abundant stone artifacts and well-preserved faunal remains within most of the seven
major stratigraphic beds have the potential to provide important information regarding MSA
and early LSA occupations as well as Quaternary stratigraphic, paleoenvironmental, and
mammalian evolution. These data could shed new insights on the evolution of modern human
behavior in the Late Pleistocene.

Charcoal Analysis
Previous studies of the archaeobotanical record on Easter Island have lead to the discovery of
locally extinct woody taxa. Continuing research which consists of large samples of wood
charcoal for taxonomic identification will provide a quantifiable framework to study
anthropogenic wood use over the course of deforestation. In this poster, we present results

[115] Osteobiographies of Life and Death from Ancient Alalakh
Renewed excavations at Alalakh (Tell Atchana), a Bronze Age regional capital in southern
Turkey, have exposed 64 human burials. These human skeletal remains and their spatial and
material circumstances of burial represent an important contribution toward understanding the
recursive relationship between mortuary practices and social identities in the ancient Near
East. This integrated, fine-grained bioarchaeological inquiry prioritizes four axes of identity
(age, sex, kinship, and health status), which are interpreted in light of abundant socio-historic
contextual information from Alalakh and other contemporary sites. The results are detailed
osteobiographies of the people who lived, worked, loved, and died at Alalakh.

[141] Emerging from the Dark: Defining Cave Archaeology as a Field
While the label cave archaeology appears to define the discipline in terms of the investigation
of a particular type of geological feature, the field has an important role within larger theoretical
debates in archaeology. Caves are simply the best context for studying certain aspects of
Mesoamerican culture, particularly religion. Our unique data set allows cave archaeology to
question basic assumptions about how religion is studied. Theoretically, we deal with religion
in its most inclusive sense that always encompasses social, economic and political forces. A
fundamental contribution of the last decade is the integration of cave data into surface
archaeological concerns.

[100] Southwestern Ethiopia as a Late Pleistocene Refugium: Recent Excavations at Moche
Borago Cave
Cold, arid conditions of OIS 4 and 2 may have led to discrete environmental refugia and
severe hunter-gatherer population bottlenecks in northern/eastern Africa. Testing the
hypothesis that highland southwestern Ethiopia was a major late Pleistocene hunter-gatherer
refugium, we conducted surveys of caves and rockshelters in this region. Test excavations at
Moche Borago cave, and subsequent preliminary analyses suggest a long, possibly
continuous late MSA-LSA sequence indicative of innovations and adaptations to acute
late/terminal Pleistocene paleoenvironmental fluctuations. We conclude that such refugium
adaptations may have shaped social organizations necessary for later founder groups to
successfully migrate across and out of Africa.

[158] Style, Function and Archaeological Site Formation Processes
The Price Equation provides a basis to model exactly the evolution of any archaeological

Under conditions of rapid sedimentation and low site disturbance it is possible to estimate with
great precision and accuracy both the strength of selection and the influence of stochastic
processes on evolutionary change. Such ideal sedimentary conditions rarely obtain, however.
Simulations are used to investigate the influence of site formation processes including
depositional time averaging and disturbance on our ability to quantify the processes of
evolutionary change.

During 19th and early 20th centuries, Maya hunters routinely negotiated with the Animal

The active relationship between hunters and Animal Guardian had direct archaeological
implications. Specifically, certain bones of wild animals were not discarded in household
middens but were “handed over” to the Animal Guardian at animated places in the landscape,
resulting in the formation of often impressive fauna caches. Once deposited, the Animal
Guardian counted the bones to assure that the correct number of individuals was killed, and
skeletal remains were reanimated to create new animals.

Village life in the Lake Titicaca Basin of the Andes developed during the Formative period
(1500 B.C.–A.D. 500). To understand the role of agricultural production and its development
over this long period, I examined carbonized plant remains from three sites on the Taraco

increase in the diversity of non-cultivated species between the Middle Formative (800 – 250

activity and climate historically, one must do so with a site-specific, high time-resolution
viewpoint. Environmental proxies usually do not have appropriate time resolution, and are
generalized to large areas. Almost all climate models used for past climates do not have
adequate time or space resolution. They are limited at reproducing the present climate. A
climate model has been developed for archaeological studies, that is site-specific and high-
resolution. Examples which can be verified with field data will be given for the Harappa region.

[187] Stratigraphy and the Dynamic Build-Up of the Record
A hands-on presentation of the operations for producing the publication of the Global Record.
Beginning with direct field and lab observations it ends with a highly hyperlinked publication.
The result is a tool used in the field to shape the day-to-day strategy. Employing specific test
cases from the excavations of Urkesh, some select types of input are chosen to illustrate how
specific stratigraphic observations are coded. How they are run is illustrated through programs
that integrate the most atomistic details into broader syntheses – including indices and
frequencies. The final product also can be integrated into 3-D and GIS representations.

[187] Theoretical Principles and Website Applications
The success of a properly digital archaeological analysis depends on the rigor and coherence
of the pertinent theoretical presuppositions. They constitute a closed “grammatical” system
whereby each element is endowed, implicitly, with multiple tags. The application of programs
makes explicit the full web of paradigmatic connections that these tags imply, and it
automatically creates a fully hyperlinked browser edition. Each time a program is run, it
updates the very same presentation that constitutes the core of the final publication. The
minutest detail is thus immediately accessible and is at the same time embedded in a variety
of synthetic tabulations.

[158] Investigating the Peopling of North America through Cladistic Analyses of Early
Paleoindian Projectile Points
The colonization of North America remains a controversial topic. There is widespread
agreement that Clovis and related cultures of the Early Paleoindian period represent the first
well-documented indications of human occupation, but considerable differences of opinion
exist regarding the origins of these cultures. Here, we report the results of a study in which
characters derived from a continent-wide sample of Early Paleoindian projectile points were
analyzed using cladistics in order to assess competing models of colonization and adaptation.
The analyses indicate that a northern entry of populations best accounts for the observed
pattern of structure in the data.

Archaeologists are frequently challenged by inaccurate pseudoscientific representations of the
past. In an effort to determine the efficacy of teaching strategies that address the nature of
science and pseudoscience, we conducted a survey of college students enrolled in 8 sections
(pre-test n = 258) of Old and New World Archaeology. Specifically we compared pre and post-
test responses indicating student levels of support on scientific, pseudoscientific, cultural, and
religious topics. Our results indicate that students receiving specific instruction contrasting
scientific and pseudoscientific methodologies are better able to critically evaluate such topics,
with the greatest change occurring when students received additional information debunking
specific misrepresentations.

morphologically diverse, exhibiting a fusion of characteristics that, in terms of geographical

subsistence strategies unique to the greater Tran-Pecos region? What role did these middens
serve in forager subsistence in a semi-arid environment? Placing these features in their
environmental context at the meso-scale will allow for coarse-grained hypotheses about their
role/roles in subsistence to be evaluated.

sites as adherents to the fur of prey animals and to clothing, and their presence reflects the
immediate disposal of a nuisance plant. To determine what species might be expected and
their seasons of occurrence, we collected over a four year period all burs adhering to a
longhaired indoor-outdoor cat and to the clothing of the cat's owner. The study area is in the
rural hill country of south-central Indiana. These data provide a framework for understanding

This poster documents geotemporal trends in proboscidean and archaeological radiocarbon

Pleistocene of the Old World, these groups exhibit a fair degree of segregation. Fluctuations in
the frequencies of these taxa appear uncorrelated before the LGM, after which both increase
as climatic ameliorated. Mammoth extinctions only occur well after this period, consistent with
the premise that human impacts on proboscidean populations occurred during the sharp
climatic shifts of the Pleistocene-Holocene transition.

the burials of Maya elites also contain many pseudo-glyph decorated vessels. Legible writing

Frequently lumped together under the heading of “human sacrifice”, Late Shang (ca. 1250–

case, they involved a logic of punishment, with captives reduced to the status of livestock and
sacrificed for the sustenance of the ancestors. In the second case, they followed a logic
obligation, with retainers voluntarily or involuntarily following their patrons to service in death.
Yet these differences belie a common participation in a social economy of kinship and
violence structuring and structured through hierarchies of being that underlay the Shang world
order.

The integrative role of lavish burial in other socioeconomic contexts suggests a similar role

Coast of North America are more characteristic of contingent collective constructions than
individual social displays. This is evident in their rarity, scalar distinction, aggregate structure,

population density, requiring accommodation among autonomous groups may account for the

Georgian structural and landscape architecture is known for its focus on formal design and
symmetry, with the aesthetic viewshed as important as the functional characteristics of its
features. The most successful architects achieved this balance of appearance versus reality
allowing the estate masters control of what they, their guests, and their workers could and
could not see and what impression these cultural landscapes would leave on their viewers.

[83] Tiwanaku offerings and offering practices at the Rio Muerto M70 site, Moquegua, Peru
Tiwanaku mortuary practice at the Río Muerto (M70B) cemetery left us ceramic, basketry,
botanical and other offerings that differ in form, function and context from those of the better
know burials of the Chen Chen style. The distribution of this material includes surface tomb
offerings, in addition to within-tomb offerings, indicating distinctive ritual processes related to
both interment and perhaps later commemorative events. We argue that these represent
mortuary practices that are unique to the Omo Style occupation of the site.

[194] Interregional Contacts, Teotihuacano Expansion, and the Formative to Classic Period
Transition in Northern Tlaxcala
During the Late Formative to Early Classic transition communities in northern Tlaxcala
witnessed heightened economic and religious integration, followed by a dramatic
reconfiguration of lifeways associated with Teotihuacano urbanization and political expansion.
Their inhabitants were active participants in the exchanges in goods and ideas that were
channeled through the region, a natural corridor of communication. Better resolution into these
social processes is provided using several lines of new evidence, including GIS analyses,
iconography, and the household economies and eventual abandonment of La Laguna, the
dominant center in the region prior to Teotihuacano expansion.

[18] Participatory Research Mapping to Identify, Register and Survey Archaeological
Remnants in the Huasteca Region, Eastern San Luis Potosí, Mexico
This paper presents a proposal to identify, register, and survey archaeological remnants in the
lowlands of the Huasteca Region, San Luis Potosí, Mexico. The promising results that can be
achieved through the instrumentation of participatory research mapping (PRM) are shown
here following Herlihy’s et al. (2003) methodology. PRM involves the participation of local
“ethno-researchers” to lead community map-making workshops that can produce community
maps convertible into standard maps. The paper concludes that PRM opens a new, valuable
research venue to identify, register, and survey archaeological remnants, for a rescue,
conservation and management strategies for INAH and local people.

[81] Student Career Experience Program: Preparing Students for Alternative Careers in
Archaeology
An increasing number of students are now entering graduate degree programs with the
intention of pursuing a non-academic career in archaeology. Even as this phenomenon is
becoming more widely accepted in academic settings, in preparation for an alternative career
path students must often address problematic issues such as networking outside of academia,
as well as become familiar with specific knowledge and skills necessary for certain non-
academic jobs. One solution is participation in the federal Student Career Experience Program
(SCEP), a unique partnership between student, agency, and academic institution which aids in
the transition from student to professional status.

the last frontier for European exploration and colonization of North America. Colonial
relationships between Aboriginal peoples and fur traders were manifest in the social life and

[164] Estimating Historic and Prehistoric Population Levels at Fort Hood, Texas
Historic population levels at Fort Hood, Texas can be estimated from U. S. Census records.
These estimates allow evaluation of various methods of estimating population levels from
historic archaeological data. Over 15 years, over 1100 historic sites have been recorded,
covering 300 square miles. Six different methods were compared to the known population
levels. Using simulated artifact assemblages to estimate beginning and ending dates of
occupation for each site provides an impressive match to population levels. Applying the same
procedure to the prehistoric sites provides information about changes in the density of
prehistoric sites which may indicate population changes.

[54] Cultural Connections: Colonial Ceramics in Texas and Mexico
Earlier studies of Spanish colonial ceramics from the Texas missions have demonstrated that
seemingly identical wares were produced in different geographic locales. Compositional
studies verified that some clays originated in Mexico while others came from throughout
Texas. Now, a study of 600 sherds from 10 Texas missions has been completed using Native
American wares, lead-glazed earthenwares, and Mexican majolicas. Cluster analyses, based
on Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA), have distinguished signature clays and
helped differentiate between European-made wares, Mexican-made wares, and Texas-made
wares. The results of this research suggest probable production centers and distribution
patterns.

Excavations in southern Mendoza Province, Argentina indicate a dramatic reduction in site

incomplete, the paucity of archaeological data between 7 and 4 KYBP is intriguing both as a
possible response to increased regional aridity and in its resemblance to similar phenomena
seen in the Great Basin and Great Plains of North America. The current study considers broad
patterns of lithic technological organization in southern Mendoza. Preliminary work suggests
changes in technology and raw material use through time, which trends may have implications
for interpreting the purported mid-Holocene occupational hiatus.

Archaeometric analyses of pottery manufacture and exchange typically focus on the

values between these time periods is not statistically significant, the MWP δ 18O values are
comparable to those from a previous study (Fricke et al., 1995), indicating that oxygen isotope
analysis is a valuable analytical method for reconstructing past environments.

revolutionized our understanding of biological evolution. Evo Devo also has implications for
any historical discipline, including archaeology. This paper will examine some of those
implications, particularly as they impact Darwinian and agency approaches to archaeology. At
issue is the extent to which, or even whether, the past exists in the present in a “real” way. A
recent article on the philosophy of history by Runia History and Theory provides a striking
parallel to the implications of Evo Devo, and his argument will also be explored.

[97] Teotihuacan Takes Control: Settlement Systems, Resource Exploitation, and Trade Route
Connections
Once established the city and state of Teotihuacan set up in and near the Basin of Mexico a
settlement system which was relatively stable for about 500 years. This system functioned to
direct the production and/or movement of natural resources and cultural products from nearby
and distant areas to consumers in and outside of the Basin. In this paper we examine aspects
of this settlement system using surface and excavated data from the northeast Basin of
Mexico and adjacent areas.

[147] Variation in the Use of Open Space among Centers in the El Paraíso Valley, Honduras
Investigation has shown that the open spaces of El Cafetal and El Paraíso hosted different
activities. Differences in phosphate levels within the open spaces of these two sites suggest
that the El Paraíso sunken patios were not associated with phosphate-rich activities, while El
Cafetal’s open plaza was host to several activity areas involved with food preparation,
consumption, and disposal. These differences in the use of open space coincide with other
differences (such as site plan, architectural form, adornment, and ceramic assemblages)
between these two contemporary centers. They further support the notion that their inhabitants
were highly distinct from each other.

[117] Indus Meat Provisioning at Gola Dhoro: Continuity and Change
Gola Dhoro is a small Indus settlement in Gujarat, India. Subsequent to its establishment, half
of the residential space at the site was enclosed by a massive walled enclosure. The
occupants of this new residential block were involved with the manufacture of distinctively
Harappan style shell bangles. My study of a large sample of faunal remains from all periods
and areas of the site has allowed for an investigation of both changes through time and
intrasite variation in the production, processing, distribution, and consumption of the meat that
was a significant portion of the diet of this small site's residents.

[149] Lowland Maya: The Birth of Identity
Lowland Maya civilization is characterized by material culture and practices that, although
never static, maintained regional coherence for over 1,200 years. How and when did this
coherence—this Maya identity—originate? I argue that it was forged through persistent inter-
and intra-regional interaction during the Cunil horizon (c. 1000–800 BC). The product:
permanent villages and uniform material styles, symbols, and mythic-religious practices. The
motivation: agricultural pursuits and a quest for related knowledge and exotic goods. This was
the birth of Maya identity in the ethereal and corporeal realms; a defining era of group
formation and the path to Maya civilization.

[109] The Southward Expansion of the Shang Culture? Analysis of Proto-Porcelains
Excavated at Anyang by the IHP
Proto-porcelains dated to the Shang period have been found at many sites in North and South
China. Chemical compositional analyses suggest both a southern-origin and a multi-origin
model. IHP’s Anyang excavations in the 1930s yielded several fragments of proto-porcelains
that have yet to be scientifically analyzed. This paper examines these fragments via
petrographic analysis for the phase identification and textural examination, and via the ICP-ES
and PIXE elemental analysis for the glaze and the body of the ceramics. Through correlating
with available compositional data from other sites, the possible origins of these artifacts are
discussed.

The southern Levantine Early Bronze Age (c. 3600–2000 BCE) involved wide-scale population
aggregation, invention of fortified towns, agricultural intensification, domestic and community-
wide storage, increasing social complexity, and transformation of social and geographical
landscapes. Only two EBA cemeteries have been excavated, and Ilan (2002) argues that EBA
mortuary practices are conspicuous for their absence. At Jericho, Bab edh-Dhra, and a limited

disarticulated and stored collectively during secondary mortuary rituals. This paper explores
potential significances to “missing” bodies, disassembled bodies, and our understanding of

New England’s mobile farmers have confounded archaeologists and historians for centuries.
Some have argued that that we simply need more data or better methods to find the large

It is vanishingly rare for the sequence at a rock-art site to be dated in detail, that is, for there to

over a known and extended period. Such a set of reliable determinations exist for the three

to be consistent over a long period at any one site—whilst at other sites only a few metres
away a different set of traits persist. Each site is indeed an individual place!

Manko Inka. Traditional usnus are absent but there are conspicuous platforms which tower
above sections of the settlements. These platform structures might be seen as speculative late
usnus which functioned as theatrical stages for the ruler's public appearances but also as
strategic observation points as can best be documented for Waman Marka and Choqek'iraw.

ridge top. Both of these contexts would have been more exclusionary and hidden than in
plaza-oriented ritual. Among the elements within the ridge top complex was a tower that was
prominently situated and may have functioned as a symbol of status and power that reinforced

Émigré Maya villages established in territory that would become British Honduras provide a
unique lens for understanding how Maya everyday life changed with autonomy. Some colonial
institutions and practices were unexpectedly retained, others abandoned. These took on new
meanings under British colonial rule, where these villages occupied a delicate political and
economic position amidst competing interests of Mexican and British Colonial governments,
logging firms, and other Maya villages. Their material record can only be understood within the
interplay of strategic resistance, affiliation, and accommodation that resulted.

geoscientists spent over a decade reconstructing the Holocene environment of the wetlands.
At the same time archaeological investigations revealed an 8,000-year history of human
occupation. Together these studies have shown that social change in the Ballona was related
to the gradual evolution of the wetlands and surrounding coastal prairie, climatic fluctuations,
and the movement of people between the desert and coast.

caves, along with swans and dogs, and prepared ocher. Late Archaic folks occasionally left
glyphs inside and frequently left shells. Women removed to rockshelters for menstruation,
birthing seclusion and reproductive health concerns and undertook related tasks while there
such as drilling, twinning, and weaving. Early Woodlanders engaged in human sacrifice and
mining while Middle Woodlanders used caves extensively for depositing the dead.
Mississippian men removed to the depths of caves to leave religious iconography.

This paper surveys the earliest attempts in North, South, and Middle America to create
integrative mechanisms for living in large groups that included non-family members. Although
considered as the evolution of social complexity and ranking, the creation of mechanisms and
institutions of social integration represented an overall simplification of social relations—from
the factorial complexity of face-to-face societies to social groupings based on mediated and
stereotyped, impersonal relationships. In the earliest experiments in group living, different
integrative mechanisms were tried, so the evidence of social "complexity" differs according to
the means of bringing together kith with kin.

[141] The Contribution of Cavers to the Development of Maya Cave Archaeology
Since the late 1980s, the subdiscipline of Maya cave archaeology has benefited from the
direct involvement of cavers who possess specialized skills necessary to map, investigate and
explore these unique environments. Additionally, cavers have contributed specialized
knowledge in such disciplines as biology, geology and computer science. Importantly, cavers
have trained archaeologists to recognize modifications, such as speleothem breakage, leading
to new insights into cave use. The methodological, theoretical, and scientific growth of the
subdiscipline can be directly attributed to the incorporation of cavers into archaeological
projects.

Color symbolism has a deep history in eastern North America, manifested in media ranging

contrastive ways, notably the juxtaposition or repetition of red and white. We suggest that such
color combinations evoked monumental time, referencing long-term patterns of deep ritual or
cosmological knowledge. Yet the doxic aspect of color and time was manipulated through
history, reworked in material form to convey notions of social time that denoted rites of
passage, or even experiential time embedded in the sensual aspects of daily life.

The perceived separateness of islands encourages archaeologists to think about interaction—

describe interaction patterns. Research in the islands of western Fiji uses provenance analysis
in a slightly different way. Clay provenance analysis (LA-ICP-MS) of a large, diachronic
archaeological pottery assemblage from five islands defines the changing spatial boundaries
of a pottery using population across multiple islands. This population description is a baseline
that helps us explain the distribution of exotic artifacts over time and space.

Significant demographic changes occurred in the Galisteo Basin during the late Coalition

and people built aggregated settlements of 100 or more rooms. Construction techniques
differed significantly between these settlements, ranging from coursed adobe, or coursed

distribution of good building stone limited the use of masonry. Distances to the nearest
sources of potential building materials are calculated using friction surfaces to assess whether
distance and effort affected the selection process.

have been the operative diagnostic artifact for Clovis which has given rise to interpretive
limitations. When available evidence permits, a more reliable characterization of Clovis
emerges from the full technology of stone tool production, use, maintenance, and discard.
Application of this approach significantly redraws the Clovis distribution map, partly resolves
old typological disputes, and focuses attention on new interpretive questions, in spite of
serious limitations in the report literature.

the remains of hutia, bones of fish, birds, and reptiles are also well represented. This paper is
an analysis of a sample of this faunal collection focusing on the ecological and economic
implications of the assemblage.

[201] The Gatekeeper Gáwasowaneh
Arthur C. Parker, also known by his Seneca-Iroquois name Gáwasowaneh, is widely
recognized as the first Native American archaeologist. Parker’s career spanned five decades
(1903–1955), during which he secured many high-level posts, including the first presidency of
the Society for American Archaeology. Today, as we contemplate the role of archaeologists as
producers and stewards of indigenous identities, it is important to consider how Native
Americans have themselves participated as “gatekeepers.” This paper examines Parker’s
career, focusing on how he sought (and often struggled) to negotiate a professional identity
bound by neither his Native heritage nor his academic authority.

[147] A Copan Residential Enclave at El Paraíso, Honduras
Investigations of an elite residential group at El Paraíso confirm that the site was established
as an enclave or outpost of Copan, most likely in the mid AD 6th century. The elite residential
architecture consists of cut-stone masonry, large internal benches, and the extensive use of
stucco and mosaic architectural sculpture. Moreover, a high incidence of both utilitarian and
fineware pottery imported from Copan has been documented. Both sets of data suggest
strong ties to Copan elites. Furthermore, the architectural sequence of this residence helps
delineate the extent of Copan’s support of the elite residents of this political enclave.

[173] Woodland and Mississippian Hunters and Fishers of the Central Mississippi Valley
Regional analysis of over 60 faunal assemblages from the Central Mississippi Valley indicates
Mississippian groups and their Woodland predecessors shared a similar animal use strategy.
This strategy focused on white-tailed deer and the abundant aquatic resources of the Central
Mississippi Valley. Differences in animal use within the region are primarily the result of site
location and local environmental conditions. However, analysis of faunal materials from the
closely spaced Meador, Parkin, and Upper Nodena sites suggest some adjustments to animal
use over time. Changes in plant cultivation, drought, and population pressure are discussed as
contributing factors to shifts in animal use.

Recent excavations at 41EP358 provide intriguing insights into patterns of early Formative
land-use along the Franklin Mountain alluvial fans, El Paso County, Texas. Excavations
conducted at 41EP358 investigated ten circular or sub-circular pit house structures over a
seven-month period. Analysis of radiocarbon, Optical Stimulated Luminescence,
macrobotanical, and faunal samples augment existing models of late Mesilla to early Doña
Ana phase (A.D. 860 to A.D. 1180) socio-organizational, seasonality, and subsistence

[17] Migration and Ethnogenesis: Long-Term Dynamics at the Site of La Tiza
The site of La Tiza was occupied from approximately 100 BC to AD 1500 and spanned the
first permanent settlement of the region through conquest and rule by the Inca. During this
long period there were episodes of migration into and out of the Nasca valley. Evidence from
strontium analysis of skeletal remains and shifts in architecture, artifact styles, burial practices,
economic organization, and political structure indicate the influx of new populations during
certain periods that contributed to social change. By the Inca conquest, new ethnic groups had
developed that may be antecedents to those recorded historically on coast.

[9] Roads of Control: Inka Colonial Strategy at the Pambamarca Fortress Complex in Northern
Ecuador
Facing fierce resistance, the Inka juggernaut constructed the Pambamarca Fortress Complex
in Northern Ecuador. Our research into the Inka conquest and the Ecuadorian resistance looks
at trade routes and roadways that interconnected the fortresses and fanned out into the other
regions of Ecuador. In historic times the Amazon trade networks have proven crucial to
establishing balances of power within Ecuador. An integral part of the Inka invasion strategy
may have been the construction of at least one route to the Amazonia in order to circumvent
previously established routes and co-opt the local trade.

The necessity for a quantitative analysis of prehistoric lithic assemblages to be free of the

Southern Plains. This is odd, given that bison remains are uniformly found at residential sites
throughout the Great Plains. To explain this geographic variability in bison hunting, data on
recorded Great Plains kill sites were synthesized from both published sources and
unpublished, government documents. These data were analyzed against the environmental
record using GIS to gauge the impact that climate and ecology had on regional bison hunting

[63] Regional Variation in Colonoware Manufacture and Use
Analysis of colonoware from 13 slave-occupied sites in South Carolina and Virginia points to
marked regional variation in vessel use and manufacture. Inter-regional variation in some
attributes, including burning, indicates proportionately fewer vessels were used for cooking in
Virginia than in South Carolina. Intra-regional homogeneity in other attributes, such as sherd
thickness, may reflect colonoware made by specialists for Virginia markets; whereas, intra-
regional heterogeneity may point to vessels made by individuals for local, household
consumption in South Carolina. Interpretations of use and manufacture are bolstered by
comparing abundance values of refined ceramics and iron cooking pot fragments to
colonoware.

The Quaternary depositional environments surrounding the Neolithic settlement of Ayn Abu
Nukhayla are strongly influenced by the local topography and lithology of the local sandstone
and grano-dioritic formations and the predominantly arid climate. The main sequences of Late
Quaternary deposits in the region include eolian sand and silt, alluvial fan deposits, and
lacustrine sediments typical of playa lakes (locally called qa'). The sequence at qa' near the
site suggests that the early Holocene was considerably moister. Changes in the orientation of
paleodunes at this period suggest also a shift in wind direction that deviates from the typical
west-east of the modern prevailing winds.

The task of recognizing and interpreting features, artifacts, and archaeological contexts
continues to be a challenging one in Northeast archaeology, despite an expansion of the data
base over the past 30 years. Nowhere is the challenge greater than in identifying Middle
Archaic (ca. 8,000–5,000 B.P.) burials, especially when skeletal remains have not been

A fundamental behavioral interface between the body and the environment – subsistence – is
reflected in archaeological faunal assemblages and the isotopic composition of human bone.
Each data source provides a complementary picture of past subsistence. Zooarchaeology
offers fine-grained accounting of consumed prey taxa at the expense of estimating individual
diet, whereas stable isotopes quantify individual diet but with poor taxonomic resolution,
particularly in resource-diverse coastal habitats. Using an iterative isotope mixing model that
accommodates multiple food sources, we compare Northern Channel Islands dietary
reconstructions based on archaeofauna and human stable isotopes to investigate subsistence

Detailed analysis of the column capitals suggests that the World Systems model is not
applicable since although Roman elements were identified, they were significantly
outnumbered by contemporary Nabataean features. The evidence rather points to the
Distance-Parity Model of cultural interaction as a better theory for Petra/Nabataea and
perhaps the Roman Empire as a whole.

cutting implements despite a paucity of good quality chert, etc. How should we think about
these ‘phantom artifacts’, or should we continue to ignore them ad infinitum for lack of direct
evidence? This paper explores these questions in relation to the market economy of Classic

[63] Socorro Black-on-White Pottery in the Cañada Alamosa: Local Manufacture or Import?
Socorro Black-on-white ceramics (A.D. 1050–1275) recovered from three sites within the
Cañada Alamosa of west-central New Mexico is theorized to initially be a trade ware but
locally manufactured after the arrival of Socorro Tradition communities in the early 1100s.
Documentation of these Socorro Tradition communities expands the southern boundary of
Socorro pottery and reflects the movement of northern pueblo groups into new territories, a
characteristic of the Pueblo II/III transition. Instrumental neutron activation analysis is used to
determine whether Socorro Black-on-white from the Cañada Alamosa sites was of local or
foreign manufacture.

[31] Visualizing Landscape Formation and Use with Downhole Susceptibility Data and GPR
Software
New options for the field measurement of fine-scale depth variations in magnetic susceptibility
along with advances in software for ground-penetrating radar (GPR) signal processing and
data presentation are two significant developments in archaeological geophysical studies.
These contributions are combined in a pioneering approach to visualize buried landscapes
using downhole magnetic susceptibility data and GPR imaging software. This study utilized
capabilities of GPR-SLICE software for processing and imaging the susceptibility data to
visualize, examine, and interpret multiple buried surfaces and areas of focused human
activities, demonstrating the potential of such an approach for understanding landscape
change and use over time.

[3] The W.S. Cole Site Resurrected: A Fresh Look at a Significant Late Prehistoric Period Site
in Central Ohio
In 1947, Richard Morgan, Curator, the Ohio State Museum, hired Raymond Baby to excavate
a site on the crest of a low glacial kame in Delaware County, Ohio. It has not been published,
but field notes at the Ohio Historical Society Collections Center are sufficiently rich to be able
to reconstruct the excavation and the context of the artifacts recovered. Combined with a later
test excavation in 1978 these data convincingly suggest that the site was a cemetery rather
than a settlement as alluded to occasionally in the literature. Radiocarbon dating suggests a
thirteenth century A.D. age of use.

[30] Dirt Cheap Dirt Science: Simple and Inexpensive Soil Analyses for Archaeological
Resource Managers
About the only thing more abundant at an archaeological site than pots and rocks is dirt. Yet,
archaeologists often do not realize the full interpretive potential of soil science. Using a series
of case studies, this poster presents a range of simple, inexpensive analyses that can shed
light on questions of interest to archaeological resource managers. By studying such
properties as texture, pH, and phosphates, it is possible to rapidly define site boundaries
without relying on artifact distributions, to prospect for activity loci and areas that have a high
probability of containing subsurface deposits, and to obtain supporting evidence for NRHP
nominations.

Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS)
Chemical-based provenance research is new to Hohokam ceramic studies, which have long

approach is our inability to characterize mica schist-tempered pottery and assign it to source.
A second involves the effects of raw clay selection on provenance assignments. Recent

potters to refine source sampling and interpret trace element patterns using LA-ICP-MS. The

[107] Obsidian Prismatic Blade Production in Northern Michoacan
The introduction of prismatic blade technology in the Zacapu region (Michoacan, Mexico)
occurred during the Late Postclassic period and must be connected with sociopolitical
changes in Tarascan society (Milpillas phase 1200 – 1450 A.D.). For this period, the
archaeological data indicate free access to regional obsidian sources and an extreme
banalization of the obsidian pressure blade. In spite of the process of centralization power
structures, the study of obsidian craft activities indicates that obsidian prismatic blade
production was realized in small independent hamlets located outside of Tarascan urban
centers.

[158] Phylogenies of Thule Period Harpoon Components from the North American Arctic
Thule period (ca. A.D. 1000–1900) harpoons from the North American Arctic were multi-
component implements primarily used to hunt sea mammals. Consisting of intricate
arrangements of harpoon heads, foreshafts, sockets, shafts, floats, and tension pieces, these
harpoons present a dilemma for undertaking phylogenetic reconstruction using cladistics,
which relates to the scale of analysis. The issue is whether whole harpoon-weapon systems
are evolving or merely changing while their individual components undergo independent
phylogenetic paths? Here I use cladistics to reconstruct phylogenies for individual Thule
harpoon components to demonstrate that the method is most effectively used with small-scale
units.

clarify site chronology, showing that the Indian Sands site holds a temporally stratified
sequence of cultural components spanning the late Pleistocene to middle Holocene. Lithic
analysis reveals use of a generalized toolkit design through time, which incorporated a variety
of local and extralocal raw materials. These data lead us to consider paleo-coastal

dramatically during the 7th–9th centuries AD. Efforts to feed the growing numbers of people
may have resulted in two different strategies: 1) use of valley escarpments that were
vulnerable to destructive erosion when cleared and planted over long periods, and 2)
reorganization of large communities into smaller hamlets that allowed for more efficient use of
riparian ecozones and adjacent landforms watered by seasonal streams.

[149] Provenance, Style and Technology: Integrated Approaches to Ceramic Production and
Exchange during the Classic to Postclassic Transition
The reconstruction of pottery production and exchange has played a central role in the study
of social and economic change in the Maya lowlands during the Classic to Postclassic
transition. While the identification of different groups of potters and locations of manufacture
during this time clearly is important, their discrimination, based on visual and chemical criteria,
is problematic. This is in part due to widespread stylistic similarity and a relatively
homogeneous regional geology. We discuss the potential of methodologies which integrate
complementary stylistic, petrographic, microstructural and chemical approaches, privileging
technological practice as an avenue to understanding manufacturing organisation and
provenance.

Prehistoric transition from hunting-gathering economies to agriculturally based ones in the

Variations in grinding efficiency and intensity exhibited by manos and metates suggest that
reliance on food grinding fluctuated but generally increased over time. Changes signifying
increased formalization of the food-grinding toolkit toward maize processing were also found.

Chinese archaeologists are sometimes charged with supporting a nationalist agenda. While it
may be occasionally true, it is necessary to realize that Chinese archaeology had an identity
and a development independent from the West. Since antiquity, Chinese scholars were
concerned with the recording of their past. As a result of this interest an antiquarian tradition
emerged in the 10th–11th centuries and bloomed in the 18th–19th centuries blending with
Western style archaeology in the early 20th century. This paper explores the transformation of

[197] Hunters and Farmers: New Fashions and Old Fashions in Archaeology
For over a century debate on the relations between Mesolithic hunter-gatherers and Neolithic
farmers has followed changing ideology and academic fashion in the various European
countries. Migrationist models, for a long time dominant in the German and central European
archaeological tradition, are now replacing, in the Anglo-American tradition, indigenist or even
immobilist models. Yet archaeological data do not necessarily follow fashion. They must be
viewed in their totality, and the whole movement of neolithization in Europe, including the Near
East, should taken into consideration, as well as comparable movements on other continents.

[15] Population Estimates For Anthropogenic Dark Earths (Terra Preta) In Amazonia
Estimates of pre-historic population densities based on cultivated field size, type, and area
covered, have previously been made for raised fields and terraces. Here we estimate densities
on anthropogenic dark earths (ADE) in Amazonia. These continuously fertile soils support
semi-intensive cultivation today. Given a crop to fallow ratio of 1:4, a maize staple, 20 people
per hectare in cultivation, and an estimated 0.2% of Amazonia with ADE, the estimated
potential total population on ADE would have been 4,800,000.

[63] Ceramics from the Rio Claro Site (AD 1000–1530), Northeast Honduras
Precolumbian Northeast Honduras is considered the northern-most extension of the Isthmo-

America and is comprised of regionalized Chibchan-speaking groups. The archaeology of
Northeast Honduras is perhaps the least well known of the entire Isthmo-Colombian Area.

[4] Evaluating Measures of Bone Fragmentation
The extent/intensification of fragmented faunal remains have been documented through
multiple measures. This project evaluates the strengths and weaknesses of such methods
using the archaeofaunas recovered from Eagle’s Ridge, an Archaic site in the coastal plains of
Texas. The development of pottery 2000 years ago by this mobile, hunter/gatherer society
may be linked to subsistence issues such as resource depression and the intensified use of
high ranked prey, which can be seen in the faunal record as increased fragmentation. The
patterns of fragmentation will be analyzed through time at this site using foraging theory
models.

[80] Cisterns in Texas
From the 1840’s to the early part of the 20th Century thousands of water cisterns were
constructed in Texas. Their size, shape, mortar, plaster linings, and other construction
techniques give important clues to their age. In urban areas, the variations in these factors are
systematic and evolutionary, but in the rural areas of Texas variation is rare and common
uniformity seems to be the rule. The construction and use of cisterns spread quickly and their
size and shape changed significantly since their introduction and the urban termination of their
use in the early 20th Century was as swift as their beginnings.

[10] The Transition from a Paleoindian to an Archaic Economy Along the Southern Plains
Periphery
Using the diet-breadth model, I compare faunal and botanical assemblages from several
Paleoindian and Archaic components located within the southern periphery of the Great
Plains, from the Eastern Woodlands to the Chihuahuan Desert and the Rocky Mountains. The
comparison of many sites across the region is useful for describing temporal and spatial
variation in the transition to an Archaic economy. Resources as well as hunting and plant
processing technologies vary within relatively short distances along the east-west moisture
gradient. Intensification of earth oven plant processing, characteristic of the Archaic Period,
appears to be delayed in the west.

Ceramics of multiple styles from five archaeological sites on Antigua were analyzed at the
University of Missouri Research Reactor Center (MURK) to obtain a better understanding of
compositional variability within Antigua. Bulk chemical characterizations of pottery were
determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA). Findings suggest that all of the

there is compositional continuity through time despite the varying stylistic and locational

This project investigates the epidemiology of the Black Death (1347–51) using large skeletal
samples from Europe. Using new paleodemograhic methods, and comparing the mortality
patterns in the East Smithfield Black Death cemetery to those in a normal cemetery sample,
this research seeks to answer the following questions: How was the excess mortality
associated with the Black Death distributed by age? Were children and the elderly at higher
risk than other age groups, or were all ages at equal risk? How was Black Death mortality
distributed by sex? The results provide new information about the mortality patterns of the
Black Death.

[89] Clovis Biface Reduction at the Gault Site, Texas
Two strategies comprise Clovis lithic technology—blade production and biface manufacture.
Excavation within the Lindsey Pit yielded four Clovis points, 57 bifaces, 464 blades, and 50
blade cores allowing concurrent study of these technologies. A variety of raw-material forms
were selected for both strategies; blocky, chert tabs were favored for bifaces. Examination of
the bifaces and associated debitage revealed that blade-making techniques were used
throughout the biface-reduction sequence culminating with the final flute removal. This
suggests a close association between the two strategies. The origins of fluting may be tied to
blade production and perhaps evolved during Clovis times.

[11] The Agency of Ancestors: Reflections on an Ethnographic Case from Africa
Ethnographic research among the Luo people of Kenya reveals that ancestors are an
important and pervasive agentive force in daily life. They can intervene in a direct, often
malevolent, way: for example, in the realm of disease and misfortune, or by appearing in
dreams and causing people to undertake actions of various kinds. But, more positively, time
and space are also structured by ancestors in ways that construct identity and the landscape,
and fear of offending them helps maintain order. This paper explains the multiple roles of
ancestors in Luo life and offers some reflections on dealing with ancestors in archaeological

indices, connected individuals to both familiar and exotic distant lands. We seek to bring trade

Anthropology now has a significant role to play in the mass disaster, bombing, and mass

demonstrated that much information can be gathered through the application of proper
archaeological techniques during recovery. This includes where to look for evidence,
expectations of remains density, and thoroughness of recovery. Repatriation of human

not entirely powerless. Using data from our ongoing work at island, coastal, and inland sites in

criteria used for ethnic identification changed as the Andes went from localized to imperial
rule, and later to European domination. A diachronic look at ethnicity in the late prehistoric
Andes provides valuable insights into Inca statecraft.

Archaeological Sites on the Pajarito Plateau, New Mexico
Stratigraphic relationships and soil characteristics provide a geomorphic framework for
Ancestral Puebloan, Archaic, and Paleoindian sites on the Pajarito Plateau near Los Alamos,
New Mexico. Ancestral Puebloan sites are partially buried, by eolian or colluvial deposits, and
are generally in good archaeological context. Mesa top sites are underlain by a sequence of
discontinuous, truncated late Pleistocene through mid Holocene soils that have preserved
buried Paleoindian sites. Although locally preserved in valley bottom and swale fill deposits,
the relative paucity of pre-1 ka Holocene deposits, absent from many locations, likely skews
the archaeological record against preservation of Archaic sites.

[208] Digging Ditches; Fortifications at Bryson-Paddock and Other Southern Plains Villages
Spanish soldiers in 1759 described a fortification consisting of a roughly circular rampart with a
stockade surrounded by a ditch at a Red River Wichita village. Similar structures, however,
were being made as early as 1500. Magnetometer surveys and excavations at an earlier 18th-
century Wichita village have revealed the presence of extensive ditches that appear to
represent portions of two fortifications. The effort expended to construct such fortifications
suggests a period of intensified intertribal conflict in the southern Plains that may be partially
attributed to increased mobility with the arrival of the horse and competition for European
trade.

[152] Degrees and Kinds of Inequality
Comparative study of social inequality requires consistent means of distinguishing greater and
lesser degrees of it. Recognizing that human societies show different kinds, as well as
different degrees, of inequality represents an advance in understanding, but only makes
assessing the degree of inequality harder. Indeed, the observation that two societies show
inequality of different sorts has frequently been offered as an antidote to the interpretation that
one shows much greater inequality than the other. Comparison of early chiefdoms shows that
different degrees of at least two basically different kinds of inequality (prestige and wealth) can
be distinguished consistently.

lower Ohio Valley and nearby but only rarely found elsewhere. Its known occurrences can be
useful in exploring geographical, temporal, and status-connected boundaries within the
Mississippian world, as well as trans-boundary interactions.

[136] Minas Nuevas, A Ghost Town
The object was for 8 and 9 year old children to awaken respect for historic sites and their
preservation. We worked with an old town on the outskirts of the city, beautiful and enigmatic
for most people: “Minas Nuevas.” Working through the academic curriculum, we discovered
part of the history of our town. The exercise was an appropriate way to obtain knowledge, not
only because it’s practical but because it gave us fun activities, clear and in sync with the
children’s needs. But it wasn’t easy. There were many obstacles to be overcome, but it was a
very fruitful and gratifying effort.

[204] Archaic Las Vegas: Early Occupations at the Meadows
The Archaic Period in Southern Nevada is generally defined by one site: Gypsum Cave. An
overview of previous research reveals a broad distribution of small task specific sites and
isolated projectile points, suggesting ephemeral use as people traveled through, tending to
cluster near washes, springs, sand dunes, and valley margins. Our research focuses on
understanding this often ignored evidence, combined with re-evaluations of known sites and
recent subsurface discoveries, and what this information says about Archaic use of the Las
Vegas Valley. Additional information on prehistoric climate; resource procurement; and
population movement broadens our understanding of this neglected time period.

[92] Molecular Relatedness and Its Correlation with Social Geography
A first approximation of the molecular lineage structure within the archaeological skeletal
population from Rapa Nui uses stylistic, ethnographic and geographic data to generate
hypotheses about the possible characteristics and sufficiency of boundaries to gene flow. This
type of social geography is a necessary foundation for understanding the historical pattern of
genetic variation within populations without biological or ecological barriers to sexual
interaction. By comparing geographic estimates of phylogenetic and social distance, we can
evaluate the synchronic record of molecular relatedness with the archaeological record of
social relatedness to begin to construct a coherent model of prehistoric lineage formation.

[183] An Early Village in the West African Savanna: Kirikongo, Burkina Faso
Villages are the fundamental building blocks of complex societies throughout the world, but in
West Africa their formative trajectories have received only limited study. Excavations along the
Mouhoun River, Burkina Faso at the mound cluster of Kirikongo (AD 400–1400) have
uncovered mud-brick architecture, abundant subsistence remains and a diverse material
culture. After describing the nature of the component parts of the settlement, the economy and
chronology, I discuss how our findings inform on the underlying socio-political integrative
mechanisms at Kirikongo and how these can help us understand developments in other parts
of the West African savanna.

[90] Pueblo Perspectives on Archaeology, Landscape and History in the Southern Cibola
Region
As part of ongoing archaeological investigations into Chaco period community organization,
we sought to increase our understandings of archaeological sites, settlement history and
landscape in the Largo Creek–Carrizo Wash area by soliciting Puebloan input and
perspectives. Working with groups from Hopi, Zuni, Acoma, and Laguna, we visited Chaco-era
residential, petroglyph locations, and later villages to discuss the process of settlement history
and change. Discussion of landscape, history and threats to archaeological and historical
resources in the region were facilitated by the project proximity to the Zuni Salt Lake. This
poster describes the project and some of its findings.

[95] Political Agenda in Assyrian and Babylonian Sculpture in the First Millennium BC
Examined in this study is the extent to which politics affected sculptural art in Babylon and
Assyria in the first millennium BC. First I examined the ways political propaganda expressed
itself, specifically through religious and military forms. Religious propaganda promoted ideas
such as service to the gods and divine protection from them, whereas military propaganda
promoted the idea of military success in battle and national prosperity. Secondly, I examined
to what extent Assyrian propaganda affected Neo-Babylonian art. The results of my analysis
suggest that Babylonian works were separating themselves from the brutality of the Assyrian
conquerors.

[110] Testing the Limits of Obsidian Hydration Analysis
The limitations of conducting hydration analysis on early artifacts are highlighted in this
analysis of roughly 350 Late Paleoindian stemmed points from the Great Salt Lake Desert.
Age, weathering, and environmental considerations are all factors that must be scrutinized
before any statements about chronology can be made. The artifacts in this study come from
numerous sites along the now desiccated Old River drainage system where Paleoindian
peoples occupied an expansive wetland area. We will discuss the importance of integrating
hydration results with various spatial, typological, and geomorphological data before inferring
any chronological relationships.

[173] Evidence for Late Woodland Salt Production in Southwest Alabama
It is generally accepted that salt was an important resource for people who rely on horticulture
for subsistence. Production of salt by Mississippian groups in Eastern North America,
therefore, is not unexpected. However, a recent analysis of ceramics from salt spring sites in
southwest Alabama suggests that local Late Woodland people were the first to make salt
there. This paper explores whether Late Woodlanders were making salt primarily for
themselves or for trading with Mississippian groups. Findings have implications for the initial
appearance of Mississippian culture in the region.

subsequent US policies attempted to remove them from American society. This paper will
examine archaeological evidence from this dynamic period and how these factors may have
effected the social and economic organization of Native American life in the region.

[168] Environmental Instability and Human Response in the Late Preclassic Southern Maya
Lowlands
Mounting evidence suggests that the Late Preclassic inhabitants of the Southern Maya
Lowlands made adaptive decisions in an environmental context charged with instability. This
instability included rising sea levels and associated hydrologic responses that affected land
use decisions both on the coast and along interior rivers. Regional climate appears to have
undergone a progressive drying trend in the Preclassic, punctuated by episodic drought.
Geoarchaeological evidence suggests that major floods, possibly generated by hurricanes,
also distressed Maya communities. Maya activities, especially land clearance, agriculture, and
quarrying also contributed to environmental instability. The Maya responded to this dynamic
environment with variable success.

A set of thriving communities existed along the Animas, La Plata, and San Juan Rivers, New
Mexico, during the Pueblo I – III time periods. While the regional Chacoan great houses of
Aztec and Salmon Ruins are well known and studied, numerous small house villages, often
clustered into groups, also flourished at this time. Work at two of these small house sites, the
Tommy Site (Pueblo I/II) and Mine Canyon Site (Pueblo III), part of the cluster of sites known
as the Point Community, has provided a diachronic view of life in a small house community.

The large Classic Period pueblos of Otowi (LA 169) and Tshirege (LA 170), located on Los
Alamos National Laboratory land, were surface collected by the Pajarito Archaeological
Research Project (PARP) in the late 1970s. Although never fully analyzed, these assemblages
offer the potential to understand both inter and intra-site occupational sequences, ceramic
technology, and important information pertaining to the historic (and perhaps prehistoric)
Keres/Tewa ethnic boundary that divided the Pajarito Plateau. This project analyzes the full
ceramic assemblages (painted and utility wares) from both sites in order to answer the above
questions and to explore relationships with the wider Rio Grande region.

[51] A Bottom Up Approach to the Maka’ainana Transformation
This paper explores a fundamental transformation of traditional Hawaiian social organization
during which typical Polynesian corporate kinship groups were replaced by congeries of
ephemeral, ego-based kindreds. Earlier attempts to theorize the transformation took a top
down approach, focusing on the arrangements developed by chiefs to manage the kindreds.
Theorization from the bottom up explores the effect of the transformation on commoners in an
attempt to develop an explanation for a curiously "uneconomic" behavior revealed by recent
large-scale archaeological excavations—the importation of hundreds of metric tons of low-
quality oven stones to the sandy Waimanalo Plain on O`ahu Island.

issues of community organization and river-based adaptations. Another area of study that has
received less attention is the study of household activities. In this paper, we examine pithouse
occupations by looking at household activities, in and around the structures, as evidenced by
ceramics. Our investigations at La Gila Encantada in southwestern New Mexico have provided
a wealth of data on household activities. By using this approach, we hope to gain new insights
into the Mogollon Pithouse period.

[45] Paleoethology as a Tool for the Development of Archaeological Models of Land-Use
The principal aim of our research is to capitalize on the close relationship between prehistoric
hunters and their prey to develop spatial models for the investigation of land-use patterns.
Ideally, these models should be useful both as predictive tools for designing regional
archaeological surveys, and as analytical tools for studying the distribution of known
archaeological sites. Here, we build upon a basic G.I.S. model (including standard
environmental variables) adding a paleoethological variable in the form of range
reconstructions for the regionally dominant, prehistoric human prey species: Equus
hydruntinus.

containing buried cultural material occupies the lee side. Excavations reveal an occupation
that contains quantities of intensively processed wapiti (Cervus canadensis) bone as well as
large amounts of fire-affected rock, lithic tools and debitage. Aeolian sand composes the
occupation substrate and also overlies and underlies the occupation zone. Stratigraphic,
sedimentological, pedological, and chronometric data are used to investigate site formation
processes, with particular focus given to evaluating post-occupational disturbance.

[167] The Production and Exchange of Polynesian Plain Ware at Aganoa, Tutuila Island,
American Samoa
Using petrographic analysis of temper, I argue that at least five production groups are
reflected in the ceramic assemblage of Aganoa, an ancestral Polynesian village. The presence
of these production groups remains consistent over time and probably reflects long term
divisions in ancestral Polynesian social organization. Preliminary analysis suggests that the
frequency of these production groups change over time. This may reflect changes in exchange
networks and settlement patterns on Tutuila island. Examining the manufacture and
movement of pottery in Samoa has important implications for understanding prehistoric
subsistence, settlement patterns, exchange networks, and social organization in western
Polynesia.

Cultural diversity can be expressed in patterns of species or animal size preferences, and can
reflect cultural identity differences across the landscape. This research seeks to tease out
functional differentiation and the potential effects of access restrictions versus cultural
preferences of animal resources among sites. It will also explore differences in procurement
versus consumption at different sites and generate expectations of these causal variables.
The reasons for high frequencies of domestic dogs recovered from ritual contexts dominated
by processed human remains will also be explored.

Camp Desert Rock was established in 1951 when U.S. military leaders decided American
ground troops needed physical and psychological training in atomic warfare. Over the next six
years, the camp was home to the nearly 60,000 soldiers that participated in military
maneuvers during atmospheric atomic weapons testing. Abandoned when above-ground
testing ended, Camp Desert Rock was dismantled and its buildings moved. Today, the camp
appears as a sterile expanse of desert dotted with rock-lined tent platforms, concrete
foundations, and trash scatters. Although visually unimposing, the site is rich with the history
of America’s nuclear weapons development and military training program.

[166] Technological Change and Brownware Pottery Technologies in the Western Great Basin
of North America
The study of pottery has long been a significant line of research in archaeology. While we
know much about technological developments for this craft in complex and agricultural
societies we know very little about how small-scale hunter-gatherer groups incorporated
modified, and developed pottery technologies. Pottery was adopted by the hunter-gatherers of
the Western Great Basin of North America about 600 years ago. Using luminescence and
radiocarbon dating, we trace technological changes in the craft from inception to abandonment
(about 150 years ago). We see significant changes in how pots were made, especially the
diversity of forms over time, and attempt to relate these changes to transmission processes
that may have been operating in prehistory.

[82] Cueva Pilote: Ritual Bloodletting Among the Prehistoric Hunters and Gatherers of
Northern Coahuila, Mexico
Cueva Pilote, a small cave hidden in the precipitous canyons of the Sierra Encantada,
northern Coahuila, produced an artifact assemblage that is best explained in the context of
ritualized auto-sacrifice, or bloodletting, a custom well-documented in the complex societies of
Mesoamerica. Four radiocarbon assays produced an age range between 600 and 1000 B.P.
for the ritual complex. Historical, ethnographic, and pictorial accounts of bloodletting and
human protein residues on a sample of agave spines support the proposition that Pilote was a
ritual cave, utilized by hunting and gathering people who shared their religious asceticism with
urban neighbors to the south.

nearby, are comparatively rare at these sites. We explore the possibility that smudged brown
ware was used in place of red ware as serving bowls, a potential indicator of historical
practice, by documenting the distribution of this pattern, its technological attributes, and
implications of patterning for social organization.

Recovery of artifacts in direct association with floors and excavations of intrusive pits, post

architecture which indicate a behavior that is not consistent with the use and intent of the
original structures. Such possibilities include radical modifications of the original occupation of
the buildings, artifact and burial searches by Preclassic Maya populations, and ceremonial
deposits of caches.

Sunset Crater and Little Springs Volcano erupted ca. A.D. 1050-1200, significantly altering the

[178] Curating and Caching Animal Bone in the Maya World: Cautions for Zooarchaeology
Ongoing archaeo-ethnographic research in Guatemala reveals a pattern of ceremonial use of
wild animal remains among the modern Maya including ritual caching and curation for re-use
of various skeletal parts. In the highlands wild animal bones are deposited in ritual caches at
sacred sites as part of hunting related ceremonies. In the lowlands wild animal bones are
curated for re-use in medicinal ceremonies often associated with the treatment of childhood
ailments. Documentary and oral-historical evidence points to a historical time-depth for these
activities. Thus they have implications for zooarchaeological interpretations of animal bone
remains recovered from ancient Maya sites.

Split-twig figurines represent a unique cultural phenomenon that was well established in the

may have played in the hunting rituals of late Archaic cultures. Here it is hypothesized that
mid-Holocene climate change from mesic to drier and warmer conditions affected the
productivity of big-game species and hence the ability of late Archaic peoples to survive in the
region. As entrances to the underworld, caves became the foci of these rituals, with the
presence of extinct big-game animal remains likely adding to their significance in prehistoric
cosmology.

[189] The Coastal Role of Islas de Los Cerros in the Chontalpa Region’s Late Classic Political
Economy
Islas de Los Cerros is a large complex of coastal sites at the mouth of the Laguna Mecoacan,
Tabasco, approximately 12 km downriver from the Late Classic interior center of Comalcalco.
The large residential population, rich ecosystem, internal ceremonial-administrative center,
and probable port function at Islas de Los Cerros indicate that the complex played a significant
role in the region’s Late Classic political economy. Models on the broader significance of Islas
de Los Cerros in the macro-coastal Maya world are discussed.

[103] Consecrating Architecture: Reverence, Dedication, and Burial at Two Residential
Compounds at El Perú-Waka’, Guatemala
This presentation involves two compounds, three buildings, three ritual deposits, eight bodies,
twenty-nine ceramic vessels and numerous bits of jade, bone, shell and 3000 pieces of
obsidian. These three deposits represent archaeological “snapshots” of the ritual activities
carried out by the Ancient Maya. Such activities took place in the compounds of the secondary
elites of the site over a period ranging from the site’s undefined Middle Classic to its Terminal
Classic florescence. The ritual deposits involve not only the laying out of the dead, in both
burial and sacrifice, but the consecration of architecture and its preparation for continued
reverence.

[169] A Cutting-Edge Experiment: Quantifying and Comparing Lithic Cutting Edge Amount
from Blade and Flake Production
Some Paleolithic/Paleoindian scholars assume that more cutting edge per mass is produced
by manufacturing blades rather than flakes. Alternatively, recent scholarship argues that rather
than being more efficient, blade technology is actually wasteful of raw material. These debates
mean little without experimental confirmation cited as evidence. This paper presents a series
of experimental results comparing the amount of lithic cutting edge per blade and flake
reduction using direct percussion. This paper also presents a new and accurate methodology
for quantifying lithic cutting edge using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator that was
applied to over 600 blanks manufactured from 6 cores.

[145] Homo ecologicus, Homo devastans, Farming, and Issues of Scale in Historical Ecology
Scholars, policymakers, conservationists, and the pubic debate whether human activities are
positive or negative for the environment. Any evaluation assumes a benchmark to which
specific anthropogenic environments can be compared. Since no natural or pristine
environments exist today or in the recent past, comparison is difficult. The continuum of
temporal and spatial scales and the changing state of an environment further complicate
comparison. In reference to multiple temporal and spatial scales, I evaluate the impact of pre-
Columbian raised field agriculture in the Bolivian Amazon through measures of biodiversity,
ecological heterogeneity, carrying capacity, landscape capital, longevity, and intensity of
anthropogenic signatures.

[154] Burial Caves and the Island Chumash: Antiquity of a Channel Islands Ritual Practice
California’s Chumash Indians used caves and rockshelters for secular and ritual activities. The
Chumash created fantastic rock art galleries in many mainland caves, for instance, but cave
art is rare on the Channel Islands. In contrast, human burials in caves or rockshelters are
common on the islands but rare in mainland Chumash territory. Ritual use of caves on the
islands appears to have begun ~7500 years ago and intensified during the Late Holocene.
Despite intensive interaction between island and mainland groups, regional variation in the
Chumash ceremonial use of caves suggests that islanders maintained some distinctive ritual
traditions for millennia.

[31] Systematic Anomaly Testing at Pueblo Escondido, New Mexico
Geophysical data often reveal great archaeological detail, but interpretations can be
questionable without test excavations. Anomaly testing has most often been done by carefully
selecting the most promising anomalies for excavation. At Pueblo Escondido we took a
different approach - stratified random sampling. This allowed us to evaluate the contribution of
each geophysical method, the reliability of various types of anomalies, and the improvement in
interpretations when anomalies are indicated by multiple methods. We also encountered a
problem with attempting to "verify" geophysical anomalies by traditional excavation methods,
since some very promising anomalies could not be found in the ground.

[144] Polities and Pots: A Study of the Material Culture of the Kekana Ndebele
The 19th century socio-economic landscape of the northern region of South Africa was
characterized by shifting authority and competition for control over resources and trade.
Chiefdoms maintained and managed their political networks through, amongst other things,
the careful negotiation of relationships through marriage alliances. Consequently, a woman's
identity was mutable; it could be maintained, or manipulated depending on the socio-economic
circumstance in which she found herself. Pottery, the material expression of women, may
provide the tangible remains of such alliances. This paper presents an analysis of the
ceramics of a known northern Amandebele group against the background of evolving political
relationships.

[188] Early Maya Ritual in the Holmul Region 800 B.C.-A.D. 100 and the Rise of Ancient Maya
States
Maya state institutions and ideology emerged from early forms of ritual behavior during the
Middle and Late Preclassic Periods (1000 B.C.-A.D. 100). Evidence from several sites in the
Holmul region of northeastern Guatemala, shows great depth of occupation in ritual spaces
and some of the earliest signs of cultural complexity in the Maya Lowlands as inferred from
artifacts and architecture. Early developments in ritual and ideology in this region of the
southern lowlands are compared to cultural trajectories elsewhere in the Maya Lowlands to
identify crucial conjunctures in the long-term development of ancient Maya states.

to understand how cultural groups with differing demographic, technological, and social

more and less reciprocal dynamics of human impacts on native taxa, and the implications of
those impacts on the sustainability of human settlement. Field data are used to examine the
model implications.

Investigation in the Gulf of Mexico
The outer continental shelf (OCS) has been exposed above sea level repeatedly over the last
25,000 years. Despite the potential for prehistoric site occurrence and preservation on the
OCS, few detailed archaeological investigations have occurred on prehistoric sites in the Gulf
of Mexico. In 2005, a buried prehistoric landform was interpreted from acoustic profiles as a
possible midden by Tesla Offshore during a geophysical survey offshore of Galveston. This
paper will discuss the process of interpreting this prehistoric site feature from remote sensing
data and outline methodologies used to prepare the subsequent investigation of the site.

[183] Intensive Survey of Prehistoric and Proto-Historic Sites in Thailand: An Alternative Views
of the Past
While reconnaissance and systematic surveys conducted over the past decades in Thailand
have discovered hundreds of prehistoric sites, recent surveys stressing intensive
methodologies have revealed unexpected patterns of land use and settlement systems. This
paper discusses the methodology and results of a recent intensive survey in central Thailand.
The 25 sites dating between 2000 B.C. and A.D. 1000 provide evidence for a prehistoric
settlement system emphasizing long-lived, often large, but heterarchically-related occupations.
Sharp changes including appearance of a site hierarchy appeared rapidly just prior to the
proto-historic period c. A.D. 400, about 1000 years later than previously thought.

[39] A Ceramic Typology for the Early and Middle Neolithic in Central Dalmatia
We constructed a quantitative ceramic typology for the Danilo Bitinj and Pokrovnik sites using
paste and fabric attributes. This typology will enable archaeological analysis of the pottery
assemblages from these sites, and provide a framework for analysis of Early and Middle
Neolithic ceramic assemblages in the region. Spectroscopic and petrologic analyses focused
on fabric type, mineral inclusion type and diversity, and inclusion size. We also hope to refine
this typology and source the materials using bulk chemical analysis from neutron activation or
x-ray fluorescence.

[106] A Cultural Landscape Analysis of the Colorado River in Grand Canyon, Arizona
For 5000+ years, the Colorado River corridor in Grand Canyon, Arizona, has attracted human
occupation. Consequently, the river corridor contains multiple, superimposed cultural
landscapes that are difficult to decipher due to the complexity of human use combined with the
effects of dynamic geomorphic processes. Using GIS analysis techniques and a culturally-
neutral site typology, we disentangle the complex geomorphic and cultural landscapes through
analyzing river flow data in relation to the placement and distribution of multiple-occupancy
and single-occupancy sites. This approach allows us to distinguish generalized human habitat
preferences from culturally-prescribed preferences and to characterize diverse human
adaptations using geospatially-defined criteria.

[37] Skeletal Element Abundances in Archaeofaunal Assemblages: Economic Utility, Sample
Size, and Carcass Transport Strategies
Economic utility indices provide a means of interpreting carcass transport decisions reflected
in the relative abundance of skeletal elements. Because of destructive taphonomic processes,
interpreting skeletal element abundances in terms of human behavior requires that analysts
consider only those elements which accurately reflect their original abundances following
human discard. In this study we examine the impact of sample size on correlations between
high-survival skeletal element frequencies and utility in four assemblages reflecting distinct
transport strategies. We show that the Shannon Evenness Index can be used as a quantitative
means of distinguishing assemblages characterized by subtle variations in skeletal element
abundances.

[219] Market System Evolution and Social Equality
Archaeologists study market system evolution over the long term, and, as a result, can
address long-standing questions about the role of markets in the evolution of complex
societies. One such issue is the relationship of market evolution to patterns of social
inequality. Marxists argue that commerce brings economic differentiation, while neoclassical
economists see markets as precursors of social equality. These hypotheses are preliminarily
evaluated using a comparative method, in two parts. One is based on an intra-cultural
comparison of Chinese rural communities, while the other is based on a world-wide sample of
pre-modern states.

highlands and the Pacific coastal plain, and the topography of the area provides excellent
natural protection. Ceramic evidence from two distinct ethnic groups was found on site, an
unidentified highland tradition and Chimú.

Chupicuaro to the West Mexican cultural sphere, as well as the connections, still poorly
understood, established with Central Highlands, particularly the Basin of Mexico. Finally, it
leads to a proposal concerning the place of Chupicuaro in Formative Mesoamerica and
examines the transitional processes to the Classic period.

self with the exterior social world or other. Particular emphasis is placed on overlapping motifs
expressed in Huastec body modification (e.g. tattooing, scarification, and body painting) and
Huastec pottery vessels. Parallel connections are made between motifs from Maya clothing
and vessels. While these parallels tie conceptions of the body to vessels, they also emphasize
the distinct manner in which Huastec social identities were expressed in relation to other
Mesoamerican peoples.

[183] Migration, Religion, and the Bracteate Connection
Investigations of migration have recently seen renewed interest within Anglo-American

methodologies, while often valuable, generally ignore the sociopolitical context of migrations
and may be incorrectly used to speculate about race and ethnicity. Here, I provide a socially
embedded analysis by considering the connection between migration and the material culture
of belief systems during the Anglo-Saxon migrations (4th-6th centuries AD), supported by
ethnohistoric and ethnographic data and an examination of bracteates from Migration Period
England and Denmark.

dated. Luminescence dating allows dates on the pottery sherds themselves. A suite of
luminescence dates from Alabama, Tennessee and Arkansas suggests that perhaps we don't
know as much about the chronology of shell-tempered pottery as we think we do.

second process of communication through the stylistic shaping and display of material culture.
These two in turn impacted a third set of dynamics that involved regional exchange systems
and competing socio-economic interests deployed across the North Atlantic and within the

[30] Artifact Size Bias in Obsidian Chemical Characterization Studies: New Data for an Old
Problem
Sampling strategies for obsidian chemical characterization studies are typically biased by the
size restrictions of the analytical equipment. The most commonly used method for obsidian,
XRF, is currently incapable of accurately analyzing the smaller debitage (that other methods
can characterize) typically recovered from archaeological sites. By selecting only artifacts
large enough for accurate analysis researchers bias their chemical source distribution toward
reduction activities involving large source material, typically locally-procured raw material. In
this study, we reanalyze the previously-reported data sets from Oregon and California in light
of new chemical and metric data from a site near Owens Lake, California.

society today, illustrating the ways in which life was literally breathed into objects and sound
used to animate and de-animate other objects.

was markedly different between the Sedentary and Classic Periods. Although these reported

investigations have left issues concerning the nature of the shift open to question. This study
uses chemical assays for obsidian provenance along with refined temporal controls to better
understand the nature of the transition in obsidian exchange strategies in the Phoenix basin.
We consider our results with reference to the transition from ballcourts to platform mounds as
the focus of Hohokam village activity.

As part of a wider institutional strategy to increase community outreach, involvement, and
commitment, the Honduran Institute of Anthropology and History’s Rock Art Project, through
its programs of Community Education and Training, has been seeking to educate and involve
local communities in the conservation, protection and promotion of their local cultural heritage
through the creation of a local heritage management structure. The effectiveness of these
efforts needs to be revised, refined and then transformed into the policy of an institution in
charge of the monumental endeavor of managing the cultural resources of an entire country.

[37] The Silence of the Lambs: Taphonomy, Quantification and the Scale of Herding
Production in the Roman Lower Rhineland
Taphonomy frequently challenges the zooarchaeologist’s attempts to determine the scale of
animal production systems and the relative importance of species in herding economies. For
example, previous studies of the Dutch Lower Rhineland during the Roman Period describe
specialized, large-scale cattle production with supplementary sheep/goat husbandry. Through
analysis of the effects of relative fragmentation and size-mediated recovery biases for cattle
and ovicaprids, this paper demonstrates that representation of sheep/goats has been
underestimated relative to cattle. The results show that multi-species herding and not
specialized cattle production best characterizes the Lower Rhineland domestic animal
economy.

[188] The Emergence of Complexity in the Cuitzeo Basin, Michoacán: from the Formative to
the Postclassic
Research during the last decade has underscored the importance of the Cuitzeo Basin,
Northern Michoacán as a link between West Mexico and the Basin of Mexico. The emergence
of socio cultural complexity in this region involves various factors such as long-distance
obsidian exchange, the existence of networks of contact, the exchange of prestige artefacts,
and the ample traffic of symbols. Drawing on a long durée perspective the interaction and
social differentiation between these two areas are examined through time.

[191] Exploring Social Isolation at Contact Period Sites in Northwestern Wyoming
Native peoples living in the western United States during the early colonial period experienced
significant disruption of traditional economic practices. This paper explores changes in range,
territories, and exchange networks among a band of Mountain Shoshones living in the Greater
Yellowstone Ecosystem (GYE). Obsidian source characterization and hydration analyses of
diagnostic projectile points from contact period sites in the GYE tests a model of social
response to encounters with warring Plains Indian tribes and Euroamerican explorers. We test
whether reduced variability of obsidian sources through time, in essence a loss of the exotic,
indicates social isolation in contact situations.

The Hohokam of the Sonoran Desert in the southwest United States are noted for constructing
the largest canal networks in the New World north of Peru. For centuries, they maintained
massive canal lines in the Phoenix Basin, supporting the densest regional population.
Hohokam farmers outside the Phoenix Basin watered their crops using canals of lesser
magnitude, floodwaters diverted from secondary drainages, and devices for capturing
overland runoff. The flexible institutions of the Hohokam provided a framework for dynamic
balance throughout their domain that involved risk sharing, demographic and labor
adjustments, productive intensification and specialization, and increasing societal
differentiation.

[169] Beyond Smoke and Mirrors: Applications of Multidimensional GIS at Two Cave /

Multidimensional visualization—commonly known as ‘3D’—has long been held with major
reservations within Archaeology; it is seen strictly as a tool for making fanciful and non-
scientific visual reconstructions of the past. Coupled with GIS technology however,
multidimensional visualization can be an invaluable tool for quantitatively and qualitatively
analyzing complex archaeological sites and issues. This paper provides brief overviews of
multidimensional GIS applications at Moche Borago rockshelter in Ethiopia and the Pinnacle
Point cave complex in South Africa. The discussion will focus on regional paleo-environmental
modeling and site-based modeling of sub-surface archaeological deposits and geological

The Western Pond turtle (Actinemys marmorata) has nearly disappeared from Washington
State, with no wild populations left in the Puget Sound region. Previous research has identified
only two prehistoric specimens of A. marmorata, although this near-absence may be due to a
failure to identify this species rather than to its absence in the region. Previously analyzed
faunal assemblages were examined for turtle specimens in order to resolve this issue. The
results of this analysis will be important in understanding the role the species played in
prehistoric economies, as well as help guide conservation efforts by recognizing prehistoric
population dynamics.

[45] Human-Animal Dynamics in the Kuril Islands
The Kuril Islands in Far East Asia were occupied by mid-late Holocene maritime hunter-
gatherers of Jomon, Okhotsk and Ainu backgrounds. Each group faced similar challenges of
semi-isolation in a stormy, earthquake and volcano prone region with limited biotic diversity
but faced the challenges of surviving in the Kurils differently. This paper examines these
differences, considering the interrelationships between Kuril animal species and each group of
colonists. We examine three variables: 1) Dietary diversity as an index of maritime orientation
and flexibility; 2) The predatory footprint of each group of colonists; 3) Vulnerability of settler
populations to fluctuations in animal resources.

[45] Deer Stones, Kherigsuurs, and Horse Heads: Human-Animal Interactions in the
Mongolian Bronze Age
Recent research on ceremonial structures of the Mongolian Bronze Age reveal the importance
of two animals: the maral (Asian elk), and the horse. Maral are used as iconic emblems in
iconography on deer stones, anthropomorphic plinths which include flying deer-bird
transformation figures. Horses are sacrificial offerings associated with deer stones and
kherigsuurs, the stone burial mound constructions found throughout much of Mongolia and the
Altai of Russia. Recently dated horse remains indicate that deer stones and kherigsuur are
part of a contemporaneous ceremonial complex dating ca. 3000 BP with implications for the
early development of Scythian art and culture.

[22] Islands of Isolation: Examining the Power of Aquatic Perimeters
Isolation has contributed over time to the development of humans culturally and biologically.
The concept of isolation was popular in earlier discussions of island peoples anthropologically
and archaeologically, but has waned in favor of models emphasizing interaction. Although
many island peoples around the world developed highly sophisticated techniques for
voyaging, this in no way assured them of constant access to other peoples or places. This
paper stresses the importance that isolation played in island societies, recognizing that even
though the sea may have been a highway, water is still a medium that requires special
conditions to overcome.

[109] Toward a Centrality of the Periphery: Focusing Archaeology in the Three Gorges
A variety of models exist in archaeological discourse to conceptualize the structure of
interactions among communities in adjacent geographical regions. Most focus on areas with
politically complex societies as cores, and relegate surrounding areas to peripheral status, the
relevance of which are defined entirely in terms of interactions with these core areas. This
paper argues for a reorientation of macro-regional interaction toward a multi-scalar model in
which different types of interrelationships are concurrently explored. The Three Gorges region
of China is presented as an example of a politically peripheral region that can be productively
examined using this model.

Ancient Swahili towns on the eastern African coast are best known for their dedication to long-
distance exchange and mercantilism within the Indian Ocean trade system. Archaeological
research has emphasized the dominant role of elite merchants in commercial activity, while
relegating non-elites outside the sphere of market exchange. Based on evidence from
households in and around the ancient town of Chwaka on Pemba Island, Tanzania, this paper
challenges that dichotomy by demonstrating how non-elite households in towns and villages
were in fact connected to market forces in ways that seem to question the presumed political
economic dominance of Swahili elites.

[78] The Art of Marriage? A Re-Evaluation of Olmec and Olmec-Related “Exogamous Bride”
Images
Although large stone Olmec and Olmec-related anthropomorphic figures tend to be physically
androgynous, past scholars asserted them largely or exclusively to represent male elites.
Recent studies by various authors confirm that the iconography of certain images indicates
that they portray women, with many scholars suggesting that the figures represent exogamous
brides who served to help establish and empower patriarchies. A comparative analysis of
these female depictions with portrayals of Olmec male elites, however, reveals that exogamy
may be too hasty of a conclusion for all female images, and that, as in later Mesoamerican
cultures, these could instead represent autonomous elites.

represent the greatest threat to biological diversity in the Neotropics.

argued that violence is used by “primitive” societies to mark political sameness or

[206] Dynamic Agricultural Landforms in a Changing Landscape: Chinampa Agriculture in the
Southern Basin of Mexico
Accelerated sedimentation in lake margin environments of the Southern Basin of Mexico in the
period since the Spanish Conquest either buried chinampa landscapes outright, or set in
motion a complex cultural response geared towards maintaining chinampa agriculture in the
face of rapidly aggrading deltas. These dynamic lake margin settings preserve a unique record
of changes in chinampa landscapes from the Late Aztec into the Historic period, during which
time a significant spatial re-organization occurred. Recent fieldwork in these environments has
revealed the changes in chinampa fields as well as some insight on the antiquity of chinampa
agriculture in this region.

[103] History and Archaeology at El Peru-Waka', an Interim Report
El Peru-Waka' periodically emerges in Classic Maya history as a strategic player on the larger
stage. Four years of archeological research and analysis at this site provide a basis for a
preliminary evaluation of the role of history in the public ritual actions and programs of the
ruling elite there. Drawing on discoveries and interpretations of our colleagues in the project,
we conclude that the people of Waka' were acutely aware of history and engaged in exalting
or damning past rulers to legitimate present authority.

[100] Human Adaptations at Urias, Valley of Antigua, Guatemala
This paper considers the interaction and impact of cultural and natural factors such as
earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and drought on population change from the Archaic through
the Postclassic periods in the Antigua Valley, Guatemala. Probable maize pollen from
sediment cores from the Laguna Quilisimate suggest that agriculture in the region may have
taken place by 4,380 B.C. Ceramics and radiocarbon dates show humans were present in the
valley again in the Early Preclassic and continued to occupy the zone through the Middle
Preclassic. Dry conditions correlate with population decline in the Late Preclassic and Late
Classic periods.

[202] Deer Hunting in Changing Landscapes: Chemical Analyses of Deer Remains from the
Upper Belize River Valley
Wild game was integral to the Precolumbian Maya subsistence economy. Strontium and
oxygen isotope analyses of deer remains demonstrate that residents of the upper Belize River
valley consumed significant quantities of deer from the Maya Mountains during the Late
Classic, likely because of high population densities, the resulting landscape, and increased
hunting pressure. Carbon isotope measures show mountain deer raided cornfields in adjacent
limestone uplands. This study compares the Late Classic period (Xunantunich) with the Middle
Preclassic (Cahal Pech) and Postclassic / Colonial (Tipu) periods to assess changing
landscapes and deer procurement strategies in light of the region’s population history.

[199] The Past in the Past in the Arctic: A Thule Inuit Reaction to the Pre-Dorset
Archaeological Record
When Thule Inuit arrived in the eastern Arctic around 800 years ago, they moved into a
cultural landscape saturated with the remains of earlier, Palaeo-Eskimo peoples. In many
ways, these earlier sites must have seemed “foreign”; that is, obviously belonging to people, or
other sorts of beings, very different from themselves. In this paper, I will describe a site near
Cambridge Bay, Nunavut which contains Thule “offerings” apparently associated with Pre-
Dorset structures. This site is interpreted as one where the Palaeo-Eskimo record may have
had a direct impact on, and been interpreted through, a Thule ideological framework.

[112] The Little Sisters of the Snow in a Field of Colonial Interaction
Colonialism can be understood as a sequence of interconnected events occurring in a long-
term arena of Indigenous and colonial interaction. Because colonialism was a late
development in Arctic Alaska, a rich data set exists for analyzing this process. Research
suggests that the early experience of religious colonialism among Yup’ik people in coastal
western Alaska is entwined with the protohistoric colonial market. This paper focuses on a
Jesuit order of Native women. Their willingness to embrace the church is juxtaposed with
men’s resistance. This differential can be explained in the context of women’s eroded status
as a result of colonial mercantilism.

[113] Hunter-Gatherers in a Desert Environment of the Northern Great Basin
Ecological Studies of Northern Great Basin desert environments describe how resources were
distributed and utilized by hunter-gatherers. Traditional views have characterized the Western
Snake River Plain as an area with low resource densities and highly varied resource
dispersals. A new vegetation reconstruction combining GIS mapping and botanical analysis
suggests that productivity and previously determined use levels may need to be reconsidered

values and use of differing sub-areas. Our research suggest suggests a varied, but potentially
greater use of the area over time than has previously been thought.

This paper examines issues of exchange and emulation in assessing resemblances among

more localized production-consumption systems. This assumption is erroneous in some
cases. I will examine the evidence for specialized production and exchange in 2 areas - south
central Quintana Roo and Northern Belize. In addition I will discuss the role of emulation in
restructuring of both serving and utilitarian vessel ceramic systems.

[4] White-Tailed Deer Carcass Exploitation across the Pre-Pottery/Pottery Boundary in Late
Holocene Southeast Texas
The development of pottery in prehistory is typically associated with a sedentary lifestyle
focused on food production. In southeast Texas, however, mobile hunter-gatherers were using
pottery while exploiting resources from several productive environments. This project seeks to
determine if subsistence change precipitated the advent of pottery in this region. In particular,
we examine butchery and transport patterns of deer across the pre-pottery/pottery boundary at
the Eagle’s Ridge site. According to foraging theory, the use of deer should intensify during a
resource depression. Here, skeletal element profiles and fragmentation rates are analyzed to
determine if this pattern occurred in southeast Texas.

[4] Consequences of Contact on Rat Island, Alaska
The Aleuts of the Western Aleutian Islands were inundated with promyshlennik ships in the

ships, laden with felonious men and Rattus norvegicus, to every island. The Russian fur trader
presence instigated changes in all aspects of Aleut life, including subsistence practices and
domestic organization. The rats and their descendants caused significant ecological change
on the islands as the rats subsist on vulnerable migratory waterfowl species. Analyses of the
material culture and fauna from site RAT-00081 inform about the contact process on Rat

Historical archaeologists have long recognized the presence of fashionable consumer goods

I use costly signaling theory to model the demographic, environmental, and historical factors

within specific contexts and suggest that the types of goods used in signaling systems differed

[135] Iron and Lithic Tools of the Early Iron Age, South India
Prior to the onset of the Iron Age (1200-300 BCE), the societies of South India relied primarily
on lithic and bone materials to make tools. Even after objects began to be made from iron,
lithic blades continued to be manufactured. As the functional properties of tools made from
either iron or stone are similar, the appearance of iron may have influenced changes in the
application and production of lithic tools. This paper explores these impacts and how they
relate to changes in the organization of craft production during the Iron Age in South India.

Contemporary Western society represents the death of a child as a terrible tragedy, a life cut

contour interpretations of past phenomena. In this paper, I consider bioarchaeological
evidence of infanticide to make sense of this practice and illuminate the cultural beliefs that
lent it legitimacy. The pre-Columbian Maya serve as case in point. I argue that rather than a
violent act, the ritual sacrifice of a child was a socially acceptable and sacred form of tribute.

and excavated materials, we studied the remains of the textile industry in the Early Iron Age
Amuq Valley, Turkey, centering our efforts on a collection of spindle whorls from the sites of
Tel Ta'yinat, Judaidah, and Chatal Huyuk. Our aim was to consider the potential uses, types,
and significance of textiles themselves and the tools used to make them.

[137] Specialization in Late Formative Khonkho Wankane
Inhabitants of the large Late Formative settlement of Khonkho Wankane were involved in a
multiplicity of activities dealing with procuring, manufacturing and distributing stone artifacts,
from construction materials and monoliths to small flaked tools, using raw materials from a
wide range of sources. This paper presents recent analysis of lithic macro and microartifacts
from residential, ceremonial, and mortuary contexts to explore some of this diversity that
points to a potential specialization in tool manufacturing by areas. Analysis of flotation samples
of Khonkho are compared to regional sites to understand changes occurring in these activities
during the Late Formative-Tiwanaku IV transition.

[76] Fortress Architecture in Pambamarca, Ecuador
The immense fortresses in the mountains of Pambamarca in Northern Ecuador stand as a
notable example of the power that the Inka state could materialize in the face of resistance by
indigenous societies. Starting with Gasparini and Margolies (1977), this paper outlines some
of the methodologies we have developed in order to investigate this vast complex of some 20
Inka and indigenous fortresses. New archaeological data are also provided that begin to
illustrate that while the primary function of the fortresses was clearly military, the logic of their
construction and the narrative of their occupation can be surprisingly eclectic and socially
diverse.

[34] A Coordinated Approach to Site Formation Analysis in Vertically Dispersed Deposits
California archaeologists have long believed most mainland sites are stratigraphically mixed
by bioturbation. Despite some studies showing burrowing rodents’ effects on vertical artifact
distributions, few systematic methods have been developed for discerning, describing, and
calibrating the extent of archaeological materials’ vertical movement. Other vertical dispersal
processes discussed in the wider site formation literature have seldom been taken into
account. This presentation offers some recommendations for assessing vertical mixing in sites
with differing sedimentary matrices, based on exploratory research with coastal sites in the
Monterey Bay area. This work may also be relevant to site analysis in other regions.

[68] Inside and Outside: Residential Burial at Formative Period Chalcatzingo, Mexico
At Chalcatzingo the common location for burials was under house floors, a practice indicating
private ritual, invoking the social memory of the household and contributing to insider
knowledge creating social difference vis-à-vis other households. However, certain high-status
burials occurred in more open locations, constituting a form of display that may have served
integrative and competitive purposes, contributing to memory formation among larger social
fields. These latter were also residential burials, occurring within the landed domain of the
chiefly houses. Both inside and outside burials drew on claims of ancestral continuity, but it is
important to explore the differences they entailed.

determine the extent to which Late Prehistoric hunter-gatherers in this region were exploiting
marginal bone resources that are usually indicative of stressful conditions. This data is then
compared with that from Mustang Branch, a Toyah site in Central Texas, in order to assess
the relative level of subsistence stress experienced in each of the two regions.

[196] Historic Landscapes In The Animas-La Plata Project Area, Southwestern Colorado
Between 1875 and 1975 Euroamericans created changing landscapes in Ridges Basin and
Wildcat Canyon based on available natural resources, different modes of production,
differential access to wealth, and social relations. Coal outcrops in Wildcat Canyon were
exploited to produce an industrial landscape of the Porter Mine and the town of Porter, served
by the Rio Grande Southern Railroad. Ridges Basin was homesteaded by some 20 farming
and ranching families, who ultimately sold their holdings to two ranches. Archaeology, archival
records, and interviews showed how competition to take advantage of the political economy of
the region created stereotypical Western landscapes.

[63] Gender and Pottery Production in the California Missions: Pathway for Male Social
Mobility or Maintenance of Indigenous Gender Ideology?
Diverse indigenous peoples in the California Missions brought with them a ceramic technology
and gender ideology about pottery production. I investigate how the reproduction of certain
ceramic technological styles by mission Indians maintained or transformed such gender
ideologies. If Mission pottery was made according to the technological style of California’s
indigenous female-gendered traditions, it is likely that women were making this pottery and
maintaining this component of their gender ideology. If we see the Spanish, male-gendered
ceramic production methods and vessel styles, it is likely that male neophytes were making
pottery, and indigenous gender ideologies changed due to colonial forces.

focused on interregional pathways, settlement patterns, and resource locations. Drawing on
modern Aymara practices of pastoralism, mobility, land-use, and political organization, this
paper works toward understanding the significance of this upland range within the context of
post-Tiwanaku collapse in which political, economic, and demographic shifts are proposed to
reflect an increased focus on regions where pastoralism were most successful.

Like other regions of the world, the prehistoric peoples of Western Mexico showed a

sources in the region, the quality of source material was variable and it appears that certain
sources of obsidian were favored. The success of chemical analysis as a method for
determining obsidian provenance is widely known. The main requirement is knowledge of the
compositional profiles for sources. We describe our progress in developing a comprehensive
database for obsidian sources in Western Mexico using both neutron activation analysis and

[38] Waves in the Desert: Applying the Wave-of-Advance Model to the Spread of Agriculture in

The origin of agriculture in the American Southwest has been a source of extensive debate, as
competing theories of indigenous invention and demic diffusion are used to explain its initial
appearance. For the European Neolithic, the existence of the latter has been supported by the
application of the Wave-of-Advance model, which successfully predicts a constant radial
spread of migrant farmers through time and space. With the use of GIS modeling, this paper
discusses both the fit of this model to the Southwestern archaeological record, as well as its
suitability for understanding the spread of agricultural economies in the New World.

In the northern Maya lowlands the transition from the Late Preclassic to the Early Classic is

explore the possibility of how changes in settlement patterns, monumental architecture, and
ceramics contribute to debates about concepts such as the Terminal Preclassic and
Protoclassic, as well as what these changes mean in terms of the cultural transition to the
Early Classic.

[181] The Social Landscape of the 13th Century Depopulation of the Northern San Juan
Analysis of regional settlement shows considerable emigration from the Northern San Juan by
A.D. 1260. This timing precedes the severe drought and intense violence in the 1270s and
1280s, often cited to explain regional depopulation. Thus, the initial stages of large-scale
emigration appear to have been prompted by a widespread disruption of intraregional social
networks and ceremonialism. Unrest may have developed in response to an influx of western
immigrants and to rapid changes in settlement organization and ritual practices that indicate a
departure from long-standing traditions. The subsequent post-1270s drought and violence
completed a process begun in the preceding decades.

of which were found in shallowly buried caches. Recent basketry reanalysis demonstrated
Fremont variability and suggested Fremont/Ancestral Puebloan interaction. Now, reanalysis of
the cordage suggests that more than one social group used the cave over a longer period of

[14] Ballgames and Big Men: Revisiting the Greater Antillean Batey
Ballgames developed widely throughout Mesoamerican and circum-Caribbean cultures from

variability in the nature of the game among disparate peoples, it appears likely that social and
political undertones rendered the game more than a sporting event in most cases.
Ethnohistorical accounts indicate that by the 15th Century AD, the Taino ballgame (batey) was
strongly contextualized by displays of wealth, generosity, and rituals intended to focus
attention on the central position of the Taino chief. In this way, the batey may implicate the
development of social inequality in the Mesoamerican Early Formative.

The Tiwanaku colonization of Moquegua was characterized by large resident agro-pastoral
populations whose domestic lifeways and mortuary practices all indicate enduring cultural and
social ties to their homeland counterparts. Nonetheless, comparison of sites and individual
cemeteries in the Moquegua Tiwanaku diaspora shows grouped variability within the greater
provincial Tiwanaku mortuary tradition. Viewing mortuary practice in light of settlement and
household data, I argue that the diversity of Moquegua Tiwanaku mortuary complexes
represents distinctive sets of cultural practices and preferences that pertain to distinct cultural
identities within the larger Tiwanaku diaspora.

[9] Terraced Fields as Monumental Landscapes: Agriculture, Ritual and Rule under the Inca
Historic texts and archaeological evidence indicate that agriculture enjoyed an elevated status
under the Inca. Chroniclers report that during the Late Horizon, feasting and elite agrarian
ceremonies were carried out in fields. The architecture of several Inca field systems is
engineered far beyond the requirements for agriculture. Using this evidence, I suggest that
certain Inca fields were used as “monumental landscapes” with roles in state religion and Inca
land tenure claims. This view of terraced landscapes as key loci for socio-political negotiations
enables a reassessment of fieldwork and interpretative strategies to assess the importance of
agrarian landscapes in Andean prehistory.

[31] Multi-Sensor Geophysical Data Fusion: A Case Study from the American Great Plains
Recent developments in the quality of shallow subsurface geophysical sensors and survey
methodologies have led to their increasing use in North American archaeology. Improved
survey speed and a suite of available sensors, which allow for the recording of various
parameters of the shallow subsurface, are making multi-sensor surveys more commonplace.
While data from individual sensors are oftentimes quite informative, data from a suite of
sensors provides additional insights. Combining these data through graphical and
mathematical methods may further increase the utility of geophysical data in archaeological
interpretations and site characterization, as in this case study from the American Great Plains.

[110] Introducing Clovis at the Topper Site, 38AL23, Allendale County, South Carolina
The Topper site (38AL23) in Allendale County, South Carolina, has been investigated for
preClovis and Clovis every year since 1998. A significant Clovis occupation has been revealed
ranging from a chert quarry in the Savannah River, the terrace- floodplain, and recently on the
hillside. A quarry-habitation site, it is estimated to cover over 30,000 meters square. The
assemblage contains typical Clovis point preforms, macro prismatic blades and bladelets, and
variety of unifaces including denticulates. At 33 latitude, Topper is the southern most Clovis
site excavated in the Southeast and geographically located on a major ecotone.

[51] The Alchemy of a Ritual Landscape: The Materiality and Meaning of Archaeological Sites
in the Summit Region of Mauna Kea
At 13,796 feet, the summit and upper slopes of Mauna Kea is an alpine desert punctuated by
massive cinder cones, lava flows, glacial moraines, outwash deposits, and subtler, modern-
day periglacial landforms. In the midst of this terrain are hundreds of stones erected by
Hawaiians, sometimes singly or in pairs, but commonly in complex configurations of up to 25
stones or more. These sites, interpreted as shrines based on ethnographic and archaeological
evidence, are the most common components of a ritual landscape that includes burials and
other remains. This paper summarizes current research on this ritual landscape from a
phenomenological perspective.

[75] Technology and Sociology of Ceramic Artifacts
Different methods of paste preparation are modifications to the ceramic production process.
Locations of ceramic production can be identified using chemical and mineralogical
identifications but technological methods of paste preparation can only be measured by
looking at the relationship between temper, pores and matrix. The method of paste
preparation represents one part of the operational sequence used to produce the ceramic and
can be compared to other parts such as form, decoration or finishing, and firing to arrive at the
material style. This paper demonstrates the value of analyzing paste preparation technology
for examining the sociology of ceramic artifacts.

[62] LA-ICP/MS Research to Identify Bison Antiquus Movement and Human Hunting
Strategies
Recent studies conducted at California State University Long Beach indicates that trace
element analysis of teeth by the LA-ICP/MS method is appropriate for examining animal
movement. These studies also indicate that the dietary uptake of Bison bison and Bison
antiquus is directly related to the elemental concentration of the associated bedrock geology.
Because modern bison are restricted residential herds, the elements in modern bison teeth
provide a map from which Bison antiquus herd movement may be reconstructed. This study
reveals the dimension of hunting structure reflected in the use of migratory or resident bison
herds to understand seasonal variability in human/bison interactions.

Archaeobotanists have analyzed plant remains from numerous Great Oasis, Mill Creek,

common use of maize, components exhibit variability in the presence and abundance of
"Eastern Agricultural Complex" seeds, common beans, and other plants. Exploratory data

organization as manifested in the archaeological record. This paper will explore this issue in
reference to pottery production and use by mobile pastoralist groups. I argue that
ethnoarchaeological data could help define: 1) factors limiting and/or encouraging craft
production in smaller-scale pastoralist economies; and 2) roles that interactions with craft-
producing hunter/gatherer groups have played in the historical development of pastoralist
systems.

[79] A Bridge Over Troubled Waters. Is There Any Use in a North-South Archaeological
Dialogue?
Paleo-Indian concept is firmly established both as a synthetic and analytic units for explaining
peopling of America. Although this concept was defined to understand North American early
occupations, it is also used to approach South America peopling. This paper will discuss the
utility of the paleoindian concept as analytical unit to characterize early occupations
elsewhere. Several features are analyzed in sites of the Pampean region of Argentina:
chronology, subsistence, lithic technology, and megafaunal extinction. Paleoindian term is not
fully applicable for explaining the archaeological variability observed on the early evidence of
human occupation in the Pampean region.

[204] Prehistoric Copycats: Rock Art Indicative of Localized Adaptation of the Tavaputs
Plateau and Surrounding Region
Rock art in the East Tavaputs Plateau and surrounding region may indicate a regional
adaptation ranging from the Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods. This localized
adaptation is seen through superimposition/replication of rock art, continued stylistic
characteristics, and modification of older rock art. The location and placement of rock art
panels may indicate continuously utilized pathways allowing for generational movement
through the region. Imitative rock art elements can provide archaeologists with vital
information of the populations that utilized this region, the resources they exploited, their
ideology, and, potentially, their adaptation to the dramatic local environment.

[21] Neolithic and Copper Age Social Organization in the Körös River Valley
This paper discusses changes in settlement organization that occurred on the Great
Hungarian Plain during the transition from the Neolithic to the Copper Age, ca. 4,500 BC (cal).
The paper explores variability in settlement variability at three scales: the macro-regional
scale, the regional scale, and at the local scale. The paper synthesizes settlement data
collected during systematic surface survey projects since the 1960s, and by the Körös
Regional Archaeological Project’s more recent investigations in the Körös River Valley.

Collaboration
The Chateau Museé in Bolougne-sur-Mer, France holds the world’s largest, most extensively
documented collection of Alutiiq masks. Seventy nineteenth century carvings represent some
of the last ceremonial artifacts produced in Alaska’s Kodiak Archipelago, and they contain
invaluable information on classical artistic techniques and spiritual belief. For the past five
years, the Alutiiq Museum, an Alaska Native cultural center, has developed a partnership with
the Chateau Museé to share this information. Collaboration and mutual respect have allowed
the Alutiiq community to take a leadership role in studying the collection, and sharing its
content both at home and abroad.

[69] The Possible Role of Violence at the Beginnings of Andean Civilization
In the 3rd millennium B.C., the Norte Chico region of Peru witnessed the emergence of
complex society with monumental labor projects, centralized decision making, organized
religion, and a social hierarchy. Within a core area of 3500 sq km among more than 30 large
ceremonial/residential centers, there is no evidence of warfare or conflict. Outside this area of
emergent development, however, there are signs of violence and conflict at a number of small
maritime sites along the coast. This paper examines possible relationships between the
violence at the small sites and the explosive cultural development in the Norte Chico.

[131] The Origin of Western Style Glaze Ware at Tijeras Pueblo: Implications for Migration and
Community Formation
The emergence of Tijeras Pueblo as a nucleated community around A.D.1300 was associated
with the transition from black-on-white decorated ceramics to glaze wares. The earliest known
examples of Rio Grande Glaze Ware come from this site, and many of these show strong ties
to Western styles. We employ a combination of petrography and INAA to determine the origin
of Western-style glaze ware from Tijeras, using local clays and known Zuni glazes for
comparison. These data have implications for understanding patterns of migration and
community formation during the PIV period in the Rio Grande.

[11] Where the Ancestors Live: Shrines and their Meaning among Rural Classic Maya
Archaeologists agree that ancestors figured prominently in the lives of the Classic Maya (AD
600-900), but most data are from monumental site centers where lavish burials of royalty were
interred in large pyramids. Much less is known of the meaning ancestors, buried in rural
shrines, had for commoners. This paper explores the meaning of hinterland shrines and
argues that, as the homes of ancestors, shrines were bound up with the creation and
continued recreation of place, rights to resources, identity, and legitimation of inequality.
Shrines embodied social memory and were permanent, conspicuous reminders of continuity
with the past.

[196] Early Pueblo I Ceramic Variability and Cultural Diversity
Early Pueblo I ceramics are predominately undecorated gray utility ware with much smaller
amounts of painted white ware and red ware. Although many archaeologists have emphasized
the lack of variability in Pueblo I ceramic assemblages, close examination of Animas-La Plata
Project assemblages reveals significant variation in clays, temper materials, and vessel shape
and size. At a larger scale, at least three distinct early Pueblo I ceramic traditions can be
defined across the northern San Juan region. This paper examines ceramic variability among
Animas-La Plata sites and relates it to cultural diversity within the project area and in the
broader region.

[84] The View from Above: Aerial Photography as an Archaeological Research Tool for Site
Discovery, Documentation, and Preservation
Aerial photography is an invaluable, though frequently underutilized tool in archaeological
research. This is unfortunate, since the aerial perspective offers archaeologists the opportunity
to see aspects of the landscape that are impossible to view from the ground, providing the
researcher with a means of discovering new sites and the ability to document and assess
known sites relatively quickly and easily. In this paper, different approaches for acquiring aerial
images are considered in terms of their relative strengths and weaknesses, including suitability
for different applications and costs, with a range of examples provided from the United States

[201] The Ethics of Not Questioning Indigeneity
As North American archaeologists gravitate toward the collaborative mode of applied

collaborations, yet also can be why they fail. North American archaeologists are increasing
their collaborations with indigenous groups, but encounter difficulty when their results conflict
with the self-identity of their collaborators. My presentation will illustrate how many of these
difficulties are inherent in the nature of identity generally, and are aggravated by the larger
social contexts in which indigeneity itself has advantageous meaning.

Several types of evidence used in this analysis—single-year age estimates, architectural

have provided unusual insights into the social organization and belief systems of the King site

This paper examines the involvement of archaeologists in the recent neo-colonial wars in the

that this event may have signaled the re-emergence of the phenomenon of the archaeologist
who is "embedded" in military structures and war machines (well-known from the colonial wars
in the previous centuries, and going at least as far back as the Napoleonic expeditions). It is
argued that this involvement presents us with a huge ethical challenge that strikes at the core

However, a neighboring protohistoric pueblo was built abiding the construction layout provided
in the creation story. These results indicate that perhaps the San Lazaro Pueblo was built
before the origin of the creation story. Digital mapping provided information about architectural
construction methods; radiocarbon data confirmed these hypotheses.

sites, leading researches to suggest that a change in forest composition was influential in the
shift to a logistic collector strategy. In the current analysis, the paleoethnobotanical samples
were dominated by thick hickory, with only a smattering of other nuts and seeds. The
preponderance of hickory is consistent with middle Holocene trends at other Midwestern sites.

Despite chronological revisions, most scholars insist regional expansion of Chichen Itza
occurred after AD 900, once power had supposedly been consolidated. Distributional patterns
of Yucatec-style architecture, found as far south as the Sibun Valley (Belize), suggest
Chichen’s “eastern Caribbean network” was established by AD 750. Excavations presented
offer evidence that support this early date. Abandoned by AD 900, Chichen’s withdrawal from
this area suggests a shift in economic and political organization, with northern expansion
occurring elsewhere in the tenth and eleventh centuries. This study highlights problems

The importance of environmental versus social factors in shaping human choices at the cusp

might expect that environmental conditions (particularly water availability) played a crucial role
in shaping ancient agriculture, but as a process that transforms modes and relations of
production early farming was also subject to social contingencies. This paper outlines results
of archaeological survey, geomatics, and ethnoarchaeological investigations that explore the
origins of agriculture in Southwest Arabia and evaluate the relative importance of hydrology,
socio-logistics, territory, and ideology in shaping the lives of early farmers.

however, characterized aboriginal western Alaska. There, such pots were produced and used
despite an absence of starchy seeds, and despite the difficulties of making pots in cold and
humid weather. This paper explores the factors that encouraged pottery use in this region, and
concludes that the answer lies not in dietary food processing requirements, but in the
problems posed by other cooking methods given the social and environmental contexts of
food production.

[217] Do Increased ∆13C Values Measured in Herbivorous Animals Primarily Indicate the
Dietary Signal of C4 Plants?
Carbon isotope analysis of herbivorous animals and humans is commonly used to evaluate
the relative contribution of C4 versus C3 plants to their diet. It is often assumed that an
increase in the d13C values of herbivorous animals is caused by an increase in the proportion

[52] Water Management in Egyptian Civilization
There is no centralized management of Nile floods during the early stages of Egyptian
civilization from 3200 to 2200 BC. By 2185 BC, drastic reduction in Nile floods led to the
collapse of centralized government and period of anarchy that lasted for almost two centuries.
Rulers of the Middle Kingdom who re-unified the country and re-established centralized
government initiated a national water project in the Faiyum which included the construction of
a dam. The dam was destroyed later as a result of catastrophically high floods and no
significant water works were undertaken until the Ptolemaic period.

I hope to discuss how powerful the PEB hard won information is when we link our questions
about the past with our data. Breakthroughs have been with coprolites for examples, to see
annual seasonal cycles and meals, opening up food archaeology, or by contextualizing
botanical data with other material, the PEB data tell us more, or pushing phytolith analysis has
helped starch analysis. By tacking back and forth we can continue to push the boundaries of
both our disciplines as well as archaeological understanding. I will use specific examples with

[94] A Simple Application of Evolutionary Archaeology: Identifying Historical Continuity Based
on Flakes, Blades, Microblades, and Bifaces in the Aleutians
The relationship of the prehistoric occupants of the Aleutian Islands has been a matter of
research and speculation for centuries. However, very few researchers have actually
compared site assemblages along the chain. Since these islands span 1000 miles, their
relationship is far from obvious. I compared chipped stone debris and tools from eastern,
central, and western Aleutian sites dating between 3000 and 9000 calendar years ago to
determine if they represent related or different populations. This comparison illustrates
comparable technologies, based on the presence of macroblade, microblade, and bifacial
technology across the Aleutian archipelago, and thus demonstrates historical continuity.

Political ecology examines the links between culture, relations of power, and the environment

dynamics that complements historical and ethnographic accounts. An example is drawn from
fieldwork on the Pampa de Chaparrí on the desert north coast of Peru. Here, stable, long-term
local management of extensive prehispanic canal systems was replaced by more centralized
decision making following the Chimú, Inka, and Spanish conquests, resulting in dramatic
changes in the everyday lives of local inhabitants.

[11] Ancestors: Their Role in Past Caribbean Societies
Ethnohistorical accounts of native religion, and ethnographic studies of culturally cognate
lowland South American cultures, suggest that ancestors played a central role in the individual

class of supernatural beings and forces which continued to remain influential even after death.
Their physical expression, it has been argued, is especially evident in the rock art of the area,
with its abundant anthropomorphic images. In our review of this topic, we suggest that certain
interpretations need to be more nuanced to better fit a non-western pre-modern view of one’s

Iterations of the Fractal Person
Archaeologists have long wrestled with issues of temporal and spatial scale, but insufficient
attention is given to the patterns of social and symbolic "self-organization" that underlie
change in all cultural systems. Specifically, an archaeology of the body or “habitus,” which
extends to deep history, must be able to address not only actual human beings or behaviors,
but particularly culturally specific notions of what are commonly glossed as time-space,
materiality, and personhood. Using Roy Wagner's metaphor of the "fractal person," questions
of historicity, “self-scaling,” and deep-time archaeology are discussed with respect to some
Amazonian indigenous histories.

The Late Woodland Townsend series is generally understood as the shell-tempered ceramic

A.D. 400, appears to represent an indigenous shell-tempering tradition in the Albemarle region
of North Carolina. Replication experiments are employed to explore technological differences

innovation to account for the appearance, adoption and geographic distribution of these

[11] Ancestors and Spirits in Later Prehistoric Britain
This paper assesses the idea that people during later prehistory across Britain had an active
idea of a past—one that included people who had lived in different ways from contemporary
populations. Two case studies are discussed: the re-analysis of information for the re-use of
Neolithic/Bronze Age monuments in northern Britain and my current work on Bronze Age
bronze objects in later prehistoric contexts in southern Britain. These studies are used to
argue (counter Whitley) that ideas about an ancient past in later prehistoric society focused on
ancestry and defined this former world as different from current times.

[63] Firing Variability and Paste Construction in Tarascan Fine Ware Ceramics: a Preliminary
Assessment
Visual inspection and compositional analysis of sherds from Tzintzuntzan, the capital of the
western Mesoamerican Late Postclassic Tarascan state, and Urichu, a tertiary Tarascan
administrative center, provided conflicting evidence regarding paste variability in fine ware
paste recipes. In the absence of direct evidence for firing technology, a refiring experiment
should provide an important indication of the importance of firing temperature to the visible
identification of ceramic paste variability.

[107] Specialization, Household Economy and Domestic Craft Production in Mesoamerica
Most investigators discuss domestic craft production in terms of full-time or part-time activities.
While this approach is descriptively accurate it contributes little to an analytical understanding
of the organization of household economies. This presentation models domestic craft
production using a household economy and risk management approach. This approach
permits modeling craft production in terms of domestic time budgets, managing subsistence
risk, and intensifying resource production. The advantage of a household economy model is
that it incorporates diversified craft production and multi-crafting in a single analytical
framework. Obsidian craft production at Xochicalco is used to illustrate the advantages of this
approach.

In this paper I explore the complex relationship between style and expressions of identity.
Differences and similarities on decorated ceramic vessels were analyzed from Late Preclassic
and Early Classic sites collected through an extensive survey of the Mixtequilla Region.
Design hierarchy was documented on vessels to identify variations in execution that might
correspond to different social identities present in the region. Taking a contextual approach,
this research seeks to identify social identities by placing style and identity within larger social,
political and hierarchical environment, rather than using the style distribution alone to define
social interaction or boundaries.

[23] Variability in Dietary Choice by the Middle Paleolithic Societies of Central Portugal
Dietary choice in Europe prior to 30,000 - 40,000 BP centered on large, terrestrial herbivores.
However, some coastal locations offered opportunities for marine resource exploitation. Diets
of Neandertal populations in the Estremadura region of central Portugal may have been more
diversified. Excavations led by Tony Marks at the inland cave Galeria Pesada, as well as other
sites such as Figueira Brava and Mira Nascente, suggest that coastal resources were on the
menu between 36,000 and 31,000 BP. These data may hold clues regarding the nature and
timing of the genetic swamping of Neandertals by incoming AMHS populations after ca.
28,000 BP.

The role of the dead in constructing ancestry in the early sedentary villages of the Middle East

memories. The repetition of houses in one place is intimately tied to the construction of
'histories' in which dead people are also involved. Past houses and past people are thoroughly

production and reproduction emerge very slowly over the long term.

Ethnographic accounts from circumpolar societies indicate strong spatial separation of
activities within dwellings, with different tasks often taking place in specific locations relative to
a central hearth. The distribution of artifacts around a 4000 year old linear hearth feature near
Churchill, Manitoba, suggests that Pre-Dorset people also organized their interior spaces in
this way. Lithic debitage and retouched flakes concentrate on one side of this hearth, while
formal tool types tend to cluster, indicating spatial patterning of associated activities.

[175] Reconstructing the Marine Radiocarbon Reservoir along Coastal Peru: Data from the
Preceramic Site of Bandurria, Huaura Valley, Peru
The radiocarbon content of terrestrial and marine environments is different. In coastal Peru,
this difference (the marine radiocarbon reservoir) is large and potentially variable through time.
We are attempting to quantify this variation at different latitudes of the Peruvian coast
throughout the Holocene by measuring radiocarbon content of contemporary terrestrial and
marine organic materials from coastal archaeological sites. Here we estimate the magnitude of
the marine reservoir at (11°11' South, 77°35' West) ca. 5000 y Cal BP using samples from
Bandurria, a coastal Preceramic site. We present data and arguments for assessing the
reliability of our marine reservoir determination.

Non-Human Agents in Coastal Southwest Alaska
Non-human predators and scavengers living in coastal settings have long been known to
create accumulations of aquatic faunal remains that at least superficially mimic the shell and
bone middens of human occupations. The task for archaeologists is to identify distinguishing
signatures of these natural accumulations. During recent fieldwork along the Alaska
Peninsula’s Pacific coast, we collected faunal remains associated with two eagle nests and a
river otter den. Although these natural sites were impressive, containing hundreds of
identifiable remains, the taxon harvested, bone breakage patterns, and other evidence clearly
distinguish these assemblages as non-human middens.

the Virgin Islands, represent the core region of investigation. This area is considered ideal
because of its geographical constitution as a chain of islands between the landmasses of the

impact on the development, exchange relationships and the depopulation of the Lesser
Antilles that began about AD 1200.

Extensive artifact collections from the San Agustin Basin show that this paleo-lake setting was

lake level declined, the two smaller and higher sub-basins drained one into another and then
into the main basin, creating an evolving series of micro- and macroenvironments. During the
Paleoindian occupation these environments included marshlands, local ponds or lakes, and
water in the channels that drained the sub-basins. Surrounding these settings were well-
drained beach- ridges and dune fields. Locally, springs or seeps may have been active in
piedmont settings.

[201] Archaeological Capital as Cultural Knowledge
As “producers” of Native American pasts, archaeologists have acted as gatekeepers,
controlling flows of information and objects from a distant Native “other” to worlds of museums

appropriated the past as social and economic capital and as intellectual and cultural property.
Today, this role is challenged as Indigenous peoples (re)claim archaeological pasts.
Archaeologists no longer fully control uses or interpretations of things deemed archaeological,
sometimes even data itself. We discuss implications of this transformation and how questions
about political correctness obscure deeper issues of power, access, and benefit-sharing.

capture architectural attribute data at a resolution of 4mm (1 point collected every 4mm over
the surface scanned). Western Mapping, Inc. of Tucson, AZ processed the scans from each
site to create three-dimensional models of four structures. Tabular architectural data were also

be used to define cultural patterns in historic period Navajo and Havasupai architecture. The
Navajo Nation and the Havasupai Tribe have close affinity to these and similar structures on

[204] The Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric Transition on the Eastern Edwards Plateau of
Central Texas
Recent data recovery excavations at 41WM1126, the Siren site, in Williamson County, Texas,
documented a stratified Native American campsite with occupations spanning 2600 B.P. to
990 B.P., an interval straddling the transition from the Late Archaic to Late Prehistoric. The
Siren site data, which are in the initial stages of analysis, have tremendous potential for
examining the nature of the cultural ”transition” during this interval along the eastern Edwards
Plateau. This paper reviews the current understanding of prehistoric adaptations in the area
during this significant period and identifies the research questions that the Siren site data can
address.

[188] Ritual and Mortuary Complexes of Central Mongolia: Some Problems with Interpreting
the Nature of the Late Bronze Age Societies
Interpretations regarding the nature of Bronze Age societies of central Mongolia are based
almost solely upon funerary structures and archaeological evidence of ritual landscapes. The
critical peculiarity of these societies is that their monumental structures suggest a degree of
social hierarchy, with possible hints of incipient hereditary principles, and supra-local
centralized organization consistent with a chiefdom-like societal structure, yet other formal
indicators characteristic of “chiefdoms” are apparently missing. This paper will discuss some of
the current issues and problems related to the interpretations of these monuments and will
address the enduring question of societal complexity development in this region.

[168] Things Fall Apart: The First Maya Collapse
Scholarship places great emphasis, rightly so, on the renowned Maya "collapse" of the 8th and
9th centuries CE. But there is another collapse that deserves renewed focus: the dramatic
shifts and ruptures in demography, society, and culture that took place in the early first
millennium CE. This paper reviews the evidence for this collapse, suggests signal continuities
and discontinuities with subsequent periods, and posits possible reasons for changes that
represent real divides in the grand narrative of Maya dynastic civilization.

[104] Stealing Stones and Bones: Rock Quarries, Burials, and the Foundations of Tucson
Time has forgotten one of the most important economic and material contributors to the
foundation (quite literally) of Tucson, Arizona. Stone quarrying in the late nineteenth century
was important for providing a large portion of the building material for the foundations and
façades of many of Tucson’s earliest buildings and residences. While documenting stone
quarries on the hills near Tucson, several historic burials, most likely Tohono O’odham in
origin, were discovered. Given the nature and placement of the burials, it is highly plausible
that Anglo miners were unaware that their quarrying activities were dismantling Native burial
grounds.

[132] (Re)thinking Tribal Processes: Regional Ritual Organization in Northern Michigan
Research in Northern Michigan found Native American communities developed a regional
network with an intricate ritual system entailing both inter- and intra-tribal monument centers to
negotiate the social and environmental challenges of the Late Prehistoric period (AD 1200-
1600). This regional research has broader implications for understanding both historical
processes such as European Contact (ca. AD 1600) as well as conceptual theories about
“tribes” in anthropology. Rather than dismiss the utility of the term “tribal”, this paper argues
that, by developing expanded appreciations of tribal cultural processes, we can move away
from the categorical while retaining a useful comparative framework.

[202] Temple Trash or Trashed Temples? Two Terminal Classic Middens at Lamanai, Belize
As with other lowland Maya city centres, the Terminal Classic period at Lamanai is marked by
the sudden appearance of large refuse deposits in the immediate vicinity of ceremonial
structures and adjacent plazas. Representing a significant departure from previous patterns of
refuse disposal, these accumulations are often considered to relate to termination rituals
preformed upon the abandonment of these structures. This interpretation is considered in light
of the evidence from Lamanai, where extensive excavation of such deposits has enabled a
detailed examination of the history and nature of their accumulation and contents, particularly
with regard to the pottery they contain.

The archaeological landscape of southern Mesopotamia is characterized by traces of relict

Archaeological survey data has been used to illustrate a picture of changing channel and
settlement systems in southern Mesopotamia. However, past archaeological surveys have
covered only 1/3 of the alluvial plain, leaving large unmapped areas. New technologies such
as Corona satellite photography can be used in junction with past survey, maps and soil data
to reconstruct channel and settlement patterns and enhance our picture of the dynamic

[103] Royal Debitage: Ritual Uses of Flakes, Blades, and Cores at El Perú, Guatemala
It has long been noted that large quantities of obsidian debitage were deposited in some
Classic Maya tombs. The best-known examples come from Tikal, where thousands of
obsidian flakes were deposited in massive lenses above royal crypts. The question remains: if
flakes produced during the reduction of blade cores is considered refuse, then why would the
Maya cover their kings in garbage? Using a detailed technological and contextual analysis of
similar deposits from El Perú, the actual nature of the obsidian debitage is revealed. It is
argued that these deposits do not represent elaborate refuse disposal methods.

[109] "Central" History and "Peripheral" Memory: Diverse Modes of Expression and Multiple
Imports in Shang Jades
Massive historical texts, oracle bone documentation, and excavations of Anyang since the
1930s have all suggested that the Central Plains were the source of Chinese civilization. CP
jades were regarded, alongside bronzes, as implements of ritual import and as artistic matrix
for the period. However, since excavations stretched beyond the Central Plains in the 1980s,
CP standards could no longer adequately measure outside cultural developments, triggering
notions of “Center & Periphery” and “Cultural Latecomer”. This paper demonstrates with
Sanxingdui phenomena that such notions miss the evidence of cultural pluralism in which
disparate but parallel cultures flourished since the thirteenth century BCE.

From 2001-2006, archaeological and geological investigations were conducted at Boca Negra
Wash and Deann's site, two small Folsom bison processing camps. Research problem
domains were reconstruction of land use, lithic technological organization, and past
environment. Both sites are adjacent to small playas containing late glacial through Holocene
stratigraphic records. Lithic analysis suggests exploitation of material sources in the
northwestern quarter of New Mexico and very conservative use of stone. Stable isotope data
from bison tooth enamel indicate that bison diet was dominated by warm season (C4) grasses,
implying that Younger Dryas environmental conditions favored such a grassland community.

well beyond this zone of direct interaction. In hinterland areas such as the high Sierra, native
people were enduring demographic shifts, in particular, and negotiating and defining new
identities with their neighbors in the wake of such change. Ethnohistoric data are especially
important in revealing and clarifying this process.

Archaeologists have long accepted an early colonization date for Rapa Nui. Based on few

stratigraphic excavations at Anakena have established a chronology beginning around 1200
AD. Critical analysis of earlier radiocarbon determinations shows little reliable evidence for a
longer chronology. In this poster we examine the corpus of pre-750 BP dates and consider the

[109] Herders and Farmers: Interaction between the Northern Qingjian/Shilou Bronze Culture
and the Shang Civilization
This author argues that bronze artifacts, archaeological contexts, and bronze production
methods suggest that the dwellers at Qingjian, Shaanxi and Shilou, Shanxi, were herders.
Their material culture came from further north and the southward movement followed the
shifting of the steppe/forest line after the great warming period. Shang-style bronzes from this
area, on the other hand, were imported. Although the bronze-using culture at Qingjian and
Shilou was not pristine, it became one of the most prosperous bronze cultures of the Northern
Zone because of its close interaction with the Shang, the most successive agrarian civilization
during the second millennium BC.

[49] Artificial Cranial Modification on the Maya Frontier
This paper discusses patterns of artificial cranial modification among the prehistoric Maya. The
tabular oblique form was common throughout the Maya area during the Late Preclassic, while
by the Late Classic, the tabular erect form became dominate. An exception to this is found at
the frontier sites of Palenque and Copan where the traditional tabular oblique form remained
dominate. A potential explanation for this phenomenon is that along frontiers, where identity is
more threatened by the presence of other culture groups, there is a trend to be exceedingly
traditional and less progressive relative to heartland inhabitants.

[202] The Ritual Termination of Elite Residences during the Terminal Classic Period:
Implications for Understanding Ancient Maya Societal Structure
A number of researchers have recently argued that Lévi-Strauss’ “house society” model is
applicable to the ancient Maya. Although it is too vague to serve as the panacea to all our
interpretive problems, current excavations in Belize have highlighted a pattern of destruction
and/or ritual termination of elite residences during the Terminal Classic period which provides
support for the underlying foundations of this construct. It is concluded that no inherent
contradictions emerge if we emphasize the centrality of the royal “house” in conjunction with
the more widely accepted city-state model.

[114] Reassessing Environmental Change in the Western Ozarks: A Case from Rodgers
Shelter and Brynjulfson Cave
A variety of grassland fauna native to the Great Plains have been found at archaeological sites
in the Prairie Peninsula. Until recently, an accurate understanding of the role of western fauna
in this area was incomplete as there were no published methods to differentiate between mule
deer and white-tailed deer post-cranial remains. Using new techniques, mule deer have now
been identified in archaeological context from the western Ozarks. The addition of this
previously unconsidered species is altering the perceived presence of wooded and
open/grassland species in the Prairie Peninsula. Evidence from Rodgers Shelter and
Brynjulfson Cave is presented.

[74] Characterization of Serpentinites from La Venta and the Analysis of Chaîne-Operatoire
In this paper we will define the mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of serpentinites
from La Venta, the diagenetic processes, and the general physical attributes which were
constraints for the manufacture of artifacts. By examining provenance and the study of steps
of production, we can understand the importance of serpentinite as an exchange value. We
will explain why this raw material replaced most of the jadeite during the Middle Formative in
the Southern Gulf Coast of Mexico. The importance of contextual information and controlled
excavations also help us to see diachronic technological changes.

[12] Intentionality and Cultural Choices, Following Visual Narrative of Prehistoric Rock Art of
Northern Europe
Embodied realism along side art history is going to be the leading approach in understanding
intentionality and cultural choices made by prehistoric artists in creating visual depictions of
rock art. Following the visual narrative, this presentation will focus on visual interpretation of
rock carvings as 3D moving images. I shall argue that only by the use of film are we able to
visually conceptualise the prehistoric carvings of Northern Europe (5000 – 3000 BP) within our
own Western visual tradition, since only film allows us to translate from a 2D into a 3D visual
medium.

[46] Reading the Codex of Yanhuitlan
The Codex of Yanhuitlan is an early-colonial pictorial manuscript from Ñuu Dzaui (the Mixtec
region, Southern Mexico). Due to its damaged, fragmentary condition, it has proven difficult to
establish the order of the pages, as well as the contents and aims of the narrative. The
drawings show a fascinating integration of Mixtec and European stylistic elements into a new
artistic creation. By combining different sources of information and multiple lines of reasoning,
we arrive at an overall reading, which shows the impact of the military and spiritual conquest
on native dynastic history, tributary structure, and religion.

Initiated in 2001, Project Jach’a Machaca seeks to evaluate the rise of complexity and state
formation in a virtually unknown but theoretically important region of the Andean altiplano of
Bolivia. Our investigation focuses on the Formative ritual-political center of Khonkho Wankane

influential for past sociopolitical transformations: productive intensification, economic
interaction, ritual practice, and social identity. This paper summarizes our ongoing
investigation and plans for future research in a fascinating Andean region.

Multiple data sets are used to evaluate the extent and intensity of intergroup exchange and
interaction among Early to Middle Holocene hunter-gatherers that once inhabited the lower
Ohio and central Mississippi river valleys. Analysis of the spatial distributions of stylistically
distinctive bone pins and atlatl weights suggests that interaction among small local groups
increased during the Middle Holocene, reflecting the emergence of larger, more complex
regional-scale social networks. The nature of interaction among local groups is discussed and
possible explanations for changes in the level of group interdependence are explored.

[109] The Materiality of Jade Use at Anyang and Sanxingdui
The material qualities, such as durability and color (natural or altered), of nephrite critically
affected how they were perceived, exchanged, utilized, and symbolized; and the perception

near-infrared spectroscopy, we have examined jades found at Anyang and Sanxingdui. By
emphasizing the materiality of objects, our science-based analysis attempt to address
interregional interactions by not only looking for mineralogical fingerprints, but also asking
questions of the ways in which the material properties of jades were perceived and
symbolized, and how they affected social relations in culturally different societies.

This paper summarises findings of the first detailed ceramic iconographical study performed at
Lamanai, distinguished in the Maya Lowlands by its sustained occupation through the
‘collapse’, a period of decline for many other Classic Period sites. Ceramic iconographic styles
from the Terminal Classic, Postclassic, and Early Historic Periods were defined and their
evolution studied. Stylistic breaks in symbolism coincide with marked changes in Lamanai’s
cultural sphere, particularly in relation to the elite. Results show an ideology centred on the
Cosmic Dragon distinct from feathered serpent-focused beliefs as found at other Maya
Lowland centres, such as Chichen Itza in the Postclassic.

[124] To Be or Not to Be a Maize Farmer
Despite all we’ve learned about the benefits of a hunting-gathering way of life, the view that
agriculture is inherently superior to hunting-gathering remains. Thus, there is a perpetual
question concerning those people who did not invest in agricultural production – particularly if
it is clear that they knew about it! This research explores the distribution of archaeological
evidence for maize cultivation across both North and South America using environmental and
hunter-gatherer frames of reference to isolate the conditions under which hunter-gatherers,
faced with the possibility of adopting maize cultivation, choose to be or not to be a maize
farmer.

[147] Open Door Policy: Valley Integration and the Formalization of Site Access at El Cafetal,

Recent investigations in the North Plaza at El Cafetal have demonstrated that the entrance to
the site was formalized late in its occupation. This formalization included the construction of a
cobble plaza delimited by two gateway structures to the north and a low platform, step, and
wall assemblage to the south. This architectural assemblage also appears to have funneled
traffic into the Main Plaza between two non-residential pyramidal buildings. This formalization
of space may have contributed to an administrative strategy designed to increase the
connection between the site core and surrounding settlement, drawing valley residents into the

[146] Varieties of Mission Experience: Continuities and Coalescences of Southern California
Indian Tribal Groups
California Indians belonging to independent sociopolitical groups, having various forms of
social organization, and speaking different languages were brought together in mission
communities during the Spanish colonial period. Intermarriage and population decline resulted
in a coalescence of tribes. Using information derived from eight missions, the varieties of
indigenous group experiences in southern California are compared and contrasted.
Differences derive from contrasting missionization strategies and whether post-secularization
communities were located in rural or urban areas. Whether or not groups eventually became
recognized as tribes by the federal government depended upon historical and demographic
processes set in motion during mission times.

“Open-Fronted” architecture has been described at a number of sites in the Northern Yucatan.
Noted for double rear and side wall lines with a single wall line in the front, the structures are

construction, compound fishhooks, harpoons, adzes, hand clubs, bottle gourds, the coconut,
and the sweet potato reveals intriguing if not compelling cases for multiple contacts in both

The Sanak Island archipelago was deglaciated several millennia earlier than the adjacent

variability, regional seismicity, sea level fluctuations, and human occupation. Over 25 tephras
are preserved in lake sediments; tsunamis are recorded as historic driftwood lines and clastic
deposits in coastal marshes. Relative sea level has fallen during the last 6000 years,
influencing near-shore sedimentation, coastal ecology and human settlement patterns. The
introduction of cattle in the early 20th century resulted in the modification of terrestrial
vegetation, pervasive surface disturbance, and local reactivation of bluff-top dunes.

was vulnerable to conquest due to political fragmentation and unrest. Indigenous historical
data from three codices narrate the founding of Tututepec as part of the heroic history of Lord
8 Deer “Jaguar Claw.” Archaeological survey data show that the Late Postclassic site of
Tututepec covers 22 km2 and residential excavations provide data on economy and

burial was from the beginning a self-conscious strategy intended to produce these effects, how
might such innovative practices have taken shape? Data from Formative Honduras are used
to explore the transition from other forms of disposal of the dead to residential burial. Practices
of incorporation, disjunction, and commemoration central to this transition have earlier
histories that motivated their coordination in residential burial.

Most modes of archaeological illustration, such as vessel form drawings, elevation maps and

purported 'salient features. Reconstructive illustrations, in contrast, extrapolate from given
evidence, inevitably involving some interpretation and guess-work. However, new

seem to offer greater scientific accuracy to reconstructive illustration. This paper, drawing on
examples from Mesoamerican archaeology, assesses these diverse kinds of archaeological
illustration from an art historical perspective in order to explore their underlying assumptions,
communicative potential and interpretive implications.

grinding querns. This paper examines designs and handling techniques of the food processing
tools to obtain insights into the intensity of food preparation activities at Ayn Abu Nukhayla in
comparison to other Pre-Pottery Neolithic B sites in the southern Levant. The paper also
analyzes the spatial organization of food preparation activities to discuss how food preparation
activities were performed in the community at Ayn Abu Nukhayla.

[207] OSL Dating of a Qa' Sediment Sequence near Ayn Nukhayla, Jordan
Sequences of Late Quaternary deposits near the Neolithic settlement of Ayn Abu Nukhayla
include lacustrine sediments typical of playa lakes (locally called qa'). The environmental
setting with abundant deposits of eolian sand, as well as the examined time period, make
optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating the most suitable method for age
determination. A test pit was excavated in a qa' near the site and samples were taken from the
sediment sequence for OSL as well as radiocarbon dating. The determined ages have been
used to reconstruct local climate variations during the Terminal Pleistocene and Holocene.

[159] Modern and Archaeological Starch Grains from South Texas
Although the Richard Beene site has produced numerous FCR features, they lacked
macroscopic organic remains to determine their function. The morphology of some of these
features and ethnographic data suggested that they served to cook plant foods, especially
including geophytes. In the absence of macrofossils preliminary organic residue analysis,
specifically for starch grains, may prove to be a productive line of inquiry. Reference slides
were created for plants likely to have been used. Modern soil was sampled for residual starch
grain for contamination. Efforts are underway to find and identify starch grains on FCR, stone
tools, and in feature fill.

they are all adjacent to causeways. This paper explores the intriguing association of

Archaeological investigations at Campo Santo Viejo, the original Brownsville, Texas municipal
cemetery, were focused on establishing whether or not a significant number of intact graves
were still present. Documentary evidence, by itself, was unable to clarify the situation and,
indeed, proved less informative than local folklore or memory. Findings suggest that usage of
the old cemetery persisted long after a new cemetery location was established and that
interments continued after the old location had been returned to private ownership. Given the
formalized nature of the interment process these findings provide a unique perspective on
19th century mortuary behaviors and their interconnectedness with urban planning.

which power was used not only to maintain authority but also to promote marked levels of
agricultural exploitation. This paper will further explore the use of religion in the establishment
of architecture of power as the Inkas targeted the appropriation of sacred spaces that
seemingly were influenced by Formative cultures of the Circum-Titicaca region.

[129] Using GIS in Modeling Historic Archaeological Sites: Presidio San Sabá (41MN1)
Geographic Information Systems provides tools that will, we believe, become increasingly
important in various facets of archaeology, from research design, to site modeling, to
laboratory analysis. Using ESRI software, we have created a virtual model of Presidio San
Sabá in Menard County, Texas. The model highlights the architectural stages of the presidio
construction as well as helping to identify different activity areas within the site. The virtual
reconstruction of Presidio San Sabá provides a visual guide to the complex, which overcomes
the difficulties of the inaccurate 1936 reconstruction that currently dominates the landscape of
the site.

[37] Ancient DNA and Domestication of the Donkey
It has been argued that the donkey was domesticated in Africa, but the places and people
involved are uncertain. Modern donkeys fall into two mitochondrial DNA groups, the Somali
and Nubian lineages. This study focuses on archaeological specimens from sites in
northeastern Africa, the Atlas mountains, Egypt, and the Sahara. Different DNA extraction
methods are tested and positive samples cloned and sequenced. The aim of the study is to
compare recovered aDNA sequences to known sequences from modern Nubian and Somali
lineages, and other equids, with the overall goal of better understanding the location and
cultural context of domestication.

[188] The Emergence of Sociopolitical Complexity in Southern Belize: A Case Study from the
Site of Uxbenka, Toledo District, Southern Belize
The mechanisms behind the development of sociopolitical complexity in southern Belize have
been a mystery to archaeologists working in the area. Epigraphic and ceramic evidence
suggest that shifting influences from the Petén and Southeast Periphery shaped regional
development histories. Recently, the authors have begun investigations at Uxbenká, a polity
with early iconographic references to Tikal. This paper discusses the nature of proposed
connections and the subsequent development of a distinct regional cultural tradition in the

[68] Remembering One and All: Early Postclassic Residential Burial in Coastal Oaxaca,
Mexico
Deceased adults at Río Viejo were interred beneath the floors of houses, a practice that
incorporated the deceased as witnesses and actors within the world of the living after their
physical deaths. Residential burial marked the deceased as members of particular houses and
enacted a shared, multivalent house history. However, burial ritual at Río Viejo additionally
depended on the precise knowledge of grave locations. Adults were interred side-by-side in
standardized burials separated in time and space, never impacting previous burials. I consider
how the enduring memory of grave locations and specific individuals fits with the interpretation
of collective house memory.

[62] Using Stable-Isotopes to Reveal Shellfish Collection Strategies in the Namu Region,
British Columbia
Oxygen-isotope analysis was conducted on the bivalve Saxidomus gigaratea to determine the
season of shellfish collection at sites in the Namu region on the central coast of British
Columbia. Seasonal variations in temperature and precipitation are recorded in oxygen-
isotopes within shell carbonate. Oxygen-isotope analysis helps us to understand climatic
effects on bivalve chemistry and has the potential to provide further insight into interpretations
of settlement and subsistence patterns for coastal hunter-gatherers. Comparison of trends
from multiple shell samples obtained from various sites can elucidate site-specific collection
strategies. Preliminary results from this study show that shellfish collection was a multi-season
activity.

[131] Estimating Population Growth from Settlement Data: A Modeling Approach
In the northern Southwest, population growth rates are ordinarily estimated by applying a
standard compound interest formula to room counts, standardized by period length, for
successive time periods. This paper proposes a more nuanced approach that, assuming a
standard use-life for rooms, simulates room construction and abandonment, yielding a total
number of rooms occupied during a period. The model growth rate is the value at which the
model total most closely matches the count observed in the settlement data. This model can
produce quite different–and I argue, better –estimates than the standard formula, with
important implications for demographic reconstruction.

[58] A Historical Perspective on the Nature of Social Structures in Lowland South America
For a long time the archaeology of lowland South America has been obscured by a spurious
dichotomy, based on neoevolutionary models of socio-political evolution, that either claims the
emergence of hierarchical organized systems or negates them. In this paper we depart from
this approach, and argue based on the archaeological record from Amazonia and Central
Brazil that past interactions among and between societies practicing small-scale economies,
which themselves continuously change internally through time, generated novel and unique
histories, and complex social relations. An important aspect of historical transformations is the
impact on the social and natural landscape of lowland South America.

[75] Marks with a Message: Finding Meaning in White Ironstone Makers Marks
Ironstone maker’s marks reveal much more than the name of a particular pottery. In the early
1800s, English potters developed inexpensive, durable ironstone dishes which received
greatest reception in American homes. Ceramic analysis from selected historic sites suggests
that westward expansion contributed to English monopolization of ironstone dishes in the U.S.
Eventually, American potters mastered ironstone production, but often continued to use
English-looking maker’s marks. However, by the 1880s, Americans abruptly abandoned the
use of foreign marks, replacing them with those exhibiting distinct national imagery. The ever
changing marks act as cultural texts defining past social, economic, and political processes.

The Inca intentionally constructed their capital and areas around the city to showcase the

elements of the Inca would be destroyed both physically and symbolically, and Cuzco’s built
forms and ideologies would be reconstructed on different levels to symbolize the power and

This paper presents results of lithic analyses performed on two late Paleoindian Cody complex

This more complex iconographic interaction between the two cultures is the basis for a further

In contrast, we suggest that early Inka state consolidation was not monolithic but conditioned

Inka aesthetic styles and social institutions throughout the Inka Imperial Period. In this way, we

over Pueblo peoples in the seventeenth century, along with the arrival of other, non-Pueblo
Native peoples in the Southwest, served to significantly restrict the movement of Pueblo
farmers. Faced with a century of population decline from disease, warfare, and other sources,
Pueblo populations were unable to recover during the eighteenth century, as non-Pueblo

[60] The Diffusion of Shell Tempered Pottery into the Baytown Area of the Northern Lower
Mississippi Valley
Shell tempering began to be used among the Baytown peoples in southeastern Missouri and
northeastern Arkansas beginning about A.D. 800. Based on over 100 dated contexts from this
region, the shell tempering was slowly incorporated into the pastes over the next 300 years.
From ca. A.D. 800 to A.D. 1100 there was a period of mixed tempering. The component
tempers included various combinations of grog, shell, and sand in various proportions. Even
using ground shell tempered pottery was used for grog. After about A. D. 1100 straight shell is
the dominant temper found in the pottery.

[138] Practical Politics, Apache Scouts, and Active Residency at Fort Apache
Fort Apache implemented US Indian policies of subjugation and assimilation, but the site's
enduring significance may stem from the hundreds of Apache men recruited as scouts. Often
accompanied by their families, scouts set up camps around the post perimeter, positioning
themselves on locational, economic, social, and political middle ground. Employing the
concept of practical politics, a recent analysis of a Fort Apache scout camp indicates that
some Apaches confronting encroachment established active residency at Fort Apache,
possibly employing their landscape knowledge as the basis for subtle assertions of power and
improvements in their households’ material conditions.

[17] Archaeological Evidence of Geoglyph Use and Function in Palpa and Nasca, Peru
The interpretation of the geoglyphs in the Nasca region is still a matter of debate. While most
current hypotheses draw on well-known Andean concepts of social organization and religious
practices, actual archaeological evidence to test these hypotheses remains sparse. Recent
fieldwork in Palpa and Nasca resulted in a comprehensive body of survey and excavation data
that allowed activities on geoglyph sites to be reconstructed. GIS-based spatial analysis
revealed distinctive patterns of geoglyph distribution. Both lines of evidence, which will be
presented in this paper, hint at a persistent religious and social role of the geoglyphs
throughout much of Nasca history.

[117] Cultural Developments at the Chalcolithic Site of Gilund, Rajasthan
Explanations of large-scale interregional social networks are hindered by inadequate
understandings of local cultural entities. Recent work at the Ahar-Banas Chalcolithic site of
Gilund provides an opportunity to focus on community level environmental exploitation.
Knowledge of differential wild and domestic species utilization at a single locale allows
archaeologists to ascertain the way in which resident groups exploited cultural networks in
responding to environmental and cultural shifts. This paper utilizes chronologies established in
the Banas River area as indicators of local cultural developments at Gilund that reflect the
synchronic and diachronic migrations and movements of people and animals in northwest
India.

Costa Rica and Nicaragua support archaeological research under existing laws. Procedures

efficiently. Foreign participation is welcome. This having been said, the loss of archaeological
resources in both countries continues at an alarming rate. They lack legal support and human

not to issues of national need or interest. Salvage or rescue archaeology consumes almost all
resources while private, or CRM, archaeology is not encouraged. In the interest of protecting
archaeological resources, this situation must change.

[144] Archaeological Expressions of Swahili Ethnicity in 10th-16th-Century Pemba, Tanzania
Exploration of Swahili origins over the last 30 years has led to a consensus that this eastern
African coastal society was built by multiple African peoples rather than Middle Eastern
colonial ones, as once assumed. The African foundations of early Swahili ca. A.D. 700,
however, does not speak to the centuries of transformation from then on, including ongoing
effects from Islamic conversion, incorporation of Arab and Indian Ocean immigrants, and
domestication of imported material culture. I argue here that the false dichotomy of foreign and
indigenous in the study of ethnicity in this frontier zone has prevented richer understandings of
cultural constructions of identity.

structured by the active intervention of artifacts and their complex associations. The essential
relation to explore is how social significance emerges in particular historical junctures from
people’s existential implication with the cultural products that mediate their relationships.

Seismic reflection profiling and side-scan sonar, coupled with marine vibracoring, were utilized
to investigate the archaeological potential of relict (4800 – 3800 yBP), submerged (-10 mbsl)
oyster beds in Damariscotta River, Maine, USA. Ceramic Period (Woodland) groups in the
area utilized robust oyster populations, evidenced by a high density of currently eroding oyster
middens. Archaic Period oyster middens are presumably underwater. Paleogeographic

decoration on pottery. We consider how each tradition coheres as a diachronic series of
related forms. We then ask whether the series were iconographic and stylistic in different
ways. The result is a model of articulations between the traditions that, with a contextual
analysis, allows us to assess changes in strategic uses of materialized memories over the

[211] Examining Postclassic Change in Obsidian
Following the establishment of Yucu Dzaa (Tututepec) at the dawn of the Late Postclassic
Period, it conquered most of coastal Oaxaca and maintained alternatively friendly and
antagonistic relations with its highland neighbors. XRF analysis of obsidian from Early and
Late Postclassic residences in the lower Río Verde region allow us to chart the effect of the
founding of Yucu Dzaa on interregional exchange. Following a summary of the shifting
patterns of obsidian procurement, we suggest how this data may reflect the nature of relations
between lower Verde polities and their peers through time.

[45] Palaeopathology as a Tool for Exploring Ancient Horse Husbandry
The basic premise of this project is that the horse did not evolve in nature to carry or pull
loads. We have hypothesised that doing so over an extended period of time could result in the
development of bony changes. The core of this project is the systematic comparison of horses
from a variety of different populations with different life-styles. In addition to modern controls,
archaeological samples include Scytho-Siberian and Medieval riding horses, and Chinese
chariot horses. The results of this project should help us to better understand the osteological
material relevant to the origins and evolution of horse husbandry.

[114] Astragali Dice from the Protohistoric Southeastern United States Versus Those from the

Nearly twenty years ago, B. Lewis argued that astragali dice from Mississippian sites
demonstrated that Spanish explorers introduced the game to Native Americans. Lewis further
suggested astragali dice formed chronological markers for the arrival of the Spanish into the
southeastern U.S. Others have disagreed with his assessment and used radiocarbon dates to
demonstrate that the bones pre-date the Spanish. I concur with the latter assessment, and

Research undertaken by the Pambamarca Archaeology Project at the Ecuadorian site of
Quitoloma is directed toward elucidating the dynamic process of imperial expansion,
subjugation, and local resistance. Ongoing excavation permits insight not only into the broad
scale organization of Inka expansion, but also into the specific details of execution. This paper
will examine the function, spatial composition, duration of occupation, and rate of
abandonment of Quitoloma and then integrate these data into the overarching discussion of

[20] Rethinking the Beginning of Agriculture in Prehistoric Taiwan
This paper deals with the theoretical consideration of the beginning of agricultural practice in
prehistoric Taiwan. The earliest evidence for grain cultivation has been recently unearthed
from two sites on the south western Taiwan. Evidence associated with the Tapenkeng culture
(6000-5000 B.P.), characterized by a cord-marked and incised pottery style, spread around
the coastal region of Taiwan. According to the length/width ratio, this rice might be Hsien or,
Ken, and might even be Oryza rufipongo, instead of the cultivated rice Oryza sativa. This
newly discovered evidence allowed a reconsideration of how rice cultivation emerged in
prehistoric Taiwan.

[109] Cuisine, Sacrifice, and Divination at the Shang Frontier: Interregional Interaction from the
Perspective of Animal Bones at Daxinzhuang
This paper examines the ways that the local elite at the frontier settlement of DXZ reproduced
or modified the behavioral codes from the Shang metropolitan centers in realms of food
consumption and religious practice. Analysis of the DXZ faunal remains reveals the social
relations and cultural institutions that underlie the movement, consumption, and religious use
of animal products. The constitution of social prestige and cultural identity in the broader
context of Mid-Shang interregional interaction sphere, therefore, can be appreciated from
cultural patterns of food consumption and protocols of religious communication, in addition to
the typological aspect of ceramics.

[109] The Essence of Swiss Cheese: the Nature of Interaction between Anyang and Its

Thanks to its monopoly over textual records and its eminence in historiographic data, Anyang
has long been deemed the location where the Shang king resided and exercised hegemonic
power over an extended geographic area. The “dynastic” nature is often projected over the
archaeological data, despite the claim by Keightley that the Shang territory was porous like
Swiss cheese rather than solid. This paper re-examines the relationship between Anyang and
the neighboring regions. By reviewing the nature of its power and stressing the importance of
exchange, this paper attempts to resituate Anyang in the fabric of interaction rather than
political dominance.

resistance. This paper investigates the variety of tactics utilized in Pueblo resistance to
Spanish colonialism, including violence, mimicry, and appropriation. Interpreting these
phenomena from a postcolonial perspective results in a radically different picture of Pueblo life
in the late seventeenth century, one characterized by resistance—and not acculturation.

[206] Peasants, Agricultural Production and Social Inequality
Within Mesoamerican studies, peasant communities have generally been treated as a
homogeneous class, assuming that rural farmers were isolated from many of the large scale
political and economic currents of their time, except perhaps in their role as producers of
tribute for foreign lords. However, when an appreciation for sources of variation among rural
residential groups in Mesoamerica becomes the focus of inquiry, one is prone to infer a
significant degree of economic autonomy within agrarian producers. Using the data obtained
during the last several years, we discuss several settlement pattern aspects, agricultural
features and palinological remains from the Palenque region.

[23] Hayonim Care and the So-Called "Early Levantine Mousterian": New Insights into Its
Variability
Since the work of Garrod on the Near Eastern Paleolithic in the 40's, an early Middle
Paleolithic entity (her Lower Levalloiso-Mousterian) has been identified based on
stratigraphical and technological criteria. Stratigraphically positioned at the bottom of the
Middle Paleolithic sequence in the Paleolithic multilayered sites, these assemblages are
generally characterized by a quite large blady component (blades and elongated points). Often
presented as a homogeneous entity, all these assemblages have been for a long time
considered as exclusively Levallois. More recent technological studies in Hayonim cave
(Meignen 2000), Rosh Ein Mor (Marks and Monigal 1995; Monigal 2002) and Hummal Ia have
pointed out a slightly more complex picture with several core reduction strategies involved in
the blade production and more diversified retouched tool-kits than often presented
schematically in the text books. Both these new elements along with new dating results in
Hayonim allowed us to question the Early Levantine Mousterian as an homogeneous entity.

[181] Mesa Verde Migrations and Culture Change
Multiple lines of evidence indicate many 13th century migrants from the central Mesa Verde
area settled in the Rio Grande region, yet numerous elements of Mesa Verde material culture,
architecture, and settlement organization "don't make the trip." Instead, migrants appear to
have assimilated culturally and socially to existing Rio Grande patterns. This suggests that
migrants from the central Mesa Verde area traveled in small groups to a region that already
had a substantial population with long-standing cultural and social traditions. Rio Grande
forms of community organization and religious practice may also have been attractive to Mesa
Verde migrants.

For Native Americans, a tension exists between the concept of national identity as American
citizens and a historically ascribed identity as obstacles to American progress. Two of the
Smithsonian museums, the National Museum of Natural History and the National Museum of
the American Indian hold significant collections from tribal areas. This paper will consider
differences in meaning for repatriation-oriented visitors to the museums’ collections. When the
visitors conceive of the museum as an institution that is culturally derived, the experience
differs vastly from that of visiting a facility that is considered to be based in scientific behavior.

[76] Yumbo and Inka Landscape Architecture at Palmitopamba and Tulipe, Ecuador
The Yumbo sites of Palmitopamba and Tulipe on the western Andean slope in northern
Ecuador provide case studies of landscape architectural negotiation that occurred with the
arrival of the Inkas. An analysis of the constructs at the site, especially those that modified the
landscape and marked it, sheds light on the nature of Yumbo-Inka interaction and
accommodation. The apparent absence of stone buildings in this tropical setting does not
mean the absence of "the architecture of power"; a broader definition is needed where Inka
occupation was short-lived or stone buildings were not practical.

[110] Hunter-Gatherers in Periglacial Environments a Case Study of Paleoindian Occupations
along the Glacial Front in Marquette County, Michigan
In the last fifteen years, paleoindian locales have been identified in Marquette County,
Michigan indicating occupation at least since 9,500 years ago. In 2006, analysis of lithic
assemblages from archaeological sites located along the Silver Lake Basin suggests that the
initial peopling might have dated earlier between 10,500 and 10,000 years ago. Occupations
at the time were in proximity of the glacial front which was 20 kilometers away. The presence
of human groups in periglacial environments intimates adaptation to rapidly changing plant
and animal communities. This paper will discuss the significance in understanding such
adaptive processes by these early hunter-gatherers.

[212] Evidence for the Limits of Inter-Polity Competition, A View from the Pearl River
Previous research in the western Gulf Coastal Plain has argued that the largest Mississippian

their ability to restrict access to esoteric goods. These studies primarily relied on comparisons
of the abundance of non-local goods in burials. This paper builds on those studies by
examining the geographic limit of such inter-polity interactions and arguing that polity size and
signs of political centralization are useful means of identifying the effects of inter-polity
competition.

Cayuga village dating to the late sixteenth century. Faunal assemblages from pit, household,
midden, and plowzone contexts from the Carman site (ca. 1550-1600 AD) are analyzed to
illuminate subsistence activities in the upland Cayuga region. Hunting decisions, distribution of
community activities, and the gendered division of labor among the upland Cayuga will all be
explored.

Museum records are often silent regarding an object’s history, especially as information may

coupled with institutional knowledge, can reveal key connections when museum sources are
silent. We provide several examples that couple tribal information with synthetic research to
enable determinations of cultural affiliation.

[45] Modeling Mesolithic to Early Bronze Age Fishing in Cis-Baikal, Siberia
The Cis-Baikal region of Siberia is dominated by Lake Baikal and two large rivers, the Angara
and Upper Lena. Archaeologists have been working here for over a century, but
zooarchaeological studies are a recent development. This is unfortunate, as many models of
cultural evolution here focus on human-animal interaction, particularly people’s use of fish, the
remains of which have largely escaped archaeological attention. We present a model for the
roles of fish and fishing among Mesolithic to early Bronze Age peoples of Cis-Baikal. Data for
the model are derived from the Baikal Archaeological Project’s investigation of mortuary and
habitation sites.

[64] Holocene Vegetation Change and Human Plant Use in the Northwest Bonneville Basin,
Nevada/Utah
The fortunes of native people in the Great Basin were closely tied to the distribution and
abundance of plant resources, since both people and the game animals important to them
relied on those plant resources. A record of Holocene vegetation change in the northwest
Bonneville Basin is developed using palynological evidence from Blue Lake, a major regional
wetland system, and other paleoenvironmental information. This record is compared with
evidence of dietary plant use from archaeological deposits at Bonneville Estates Rockshelter,
Danger Cave, and other occupation sites in the region to document how Holocene vegetation
change influenced adaptive strategies.

[168] The End of the Formative in Western Olman
Traditional accounts of the Late and Terminal Formative periods in the southern Gulf lowlands
depict them as a time of cultural collapse and pervasive foreign influence. Recent research in
the eastern Lower Papaloapan Basin, however, reveals a cultural and demographic
florescence accompanied by the adaptation of an Olmec legacy to changing political and
economic conditions. Our research underscores the volatility of a Late and Terminal Formative
political landscape characterized by shifting relations among ruling factions within Tres
Zapotes and the growing prominence of its probable subordinate, El Meson.

[104] Torreón as Cultural Icon: Examples of the End Use of Archaeology from New Mexico
This paper examines torreóns or watchtowers in the American state of New Mexico. Torreóns
are manifestations of the Contact Era Spanish presence in the New World. However, they
have also attained an iconic status by which they persist and have meaning beyond their
original or intended functions. Study of how they have been preserved, reconstructed,
replicated and renewed illuminates the role of material culture and archaeology in defining
both past and current culture and public identity. Torreóns help us understand the complete
lifecycle of material culture and lead archaeologists across the gap between professional and
public spheres.

[205] Middle Formative Household Refuse Disposal at La Blanca, San Marcos, Guatemala
Recent excavations at Middle Formative (900-600 B.C.) La Blanca encountered a series of
differential refuse disposal patterns. Understanding differences in household refuse treatment
underlies any attempt at comparative analysis. All households used a variety of disposal
methods. In some cases refuse was casually dumped behind the house, leading to small
scatters of artifacts. More formal curation strategies involved the excavation of pits. Refuse
can be generally be associated with a particular residence or household, but in some cases
abandoned houselots and houses were used for refuse disposal, so that the point of origin for
the refuse is uncertain.

[156] Directly Dated Cucurbita from the Upper Great Lakes: Implications for Archaic and
Woodland Horticulture
Cumulative research at Green Point, Michigan, revealed complex floodplain stratigraphy
associated with Late Archaic through Middle Woodland occupation. On two occasions wetland
deposits buried 2-3 m within the floodplain yielded uncarbonized seeds of Cucurbita pepo.
AMS dates on two seeds suggest the wetland was long-lived, that squash was either
deposited as flood detritus, or growing in ruderal or tended stands. A dated overlying pit
feature reveals the wetland was buried ca. 1700 BP by a transgressive event of Lake Huron.
These observations are important for understanding the floodplain evolutionary sequence, and
for understanding the duration of squash presence on the floodplain.

[31] Geophysical Anomaly Testing with Downhole Magnetic Susceptibility
Over the past few decades archaeogeophysical instrumentation, field methodologies, and data
processing have improved dramatically. Yet it is still difficult to provide an accurate
assessment of many anomalies from standard archaeogeophysical datasets. In response to
this problem we have been developing new field techniques to aid in the interpretation of these
enigmatic anomalies. Over the past months, downhole magnetic susceptibility field tests were
conducted at Parchman Place Mounds in Mississippi. These tests utilized soils collected from
the walls of excavations analyzed in a laboratory setting and downhole magnetic susceptibility
data gathered in the field culminating in an enhanced understanding of the site.

[115] Ancient Funerals and Modern Politics: The Role of Pre-Columbian Mortuary Practices in
Shaping Modern Community Identity in Northern Chile
Recent mortuary excavations in Northern Chile required continuous dialogue between
bioarchaeologists and community members. During logistical planning of the excavation, local
inhabitants considered the individuals interred in the pre-Columbian cemetery of Tarapaca 40
as “their direct ancestors,” even though there is no clear biological evidence to support this
assertion. Through interviews, we learned that their definition of ancestry incorporates a
broader range of variables, including cultural and geographic determinants. It is conceivable
that ancestry and biological relatedness were not synonymous in the Andes and that ancestry
was a more complex social construction in the past just as it is today.

note the deceased social status. The iconographical analysis is derived from an investigation
conducted at the Popol Vuh Museum during the summer of 2006 in Guatemala which reveals
aspects of religious beliefs and legitimizes the deceased as elite members of society.

[52] Ancient Maya Water Management and Political Sacrifice
In the southern Maya lowlands, the Maya dealt with noticeable seasonal vagaries. The Maya
met these conditions successfully for millennia through use of diverse water systems that were
specific to certain environmental and social conditions. The degree of political involvement in
water management varied according to the scale of water systems. When conditions changed
(e.g., long-term drought) and rulers continued to rely on previously successful strategies that
no longer worked, everyone paid the price. Lessons from the Maya demonstrate that leaders
must sacrifice their political success by instituting policies that while unpopular, are better for
everyone on the long run.

interaction may vary from the short site tour linking the lessons of archaeology with the
present to interactive educational programs in which local residents experience their region's

[191] Ulna Marble Vases: Contextualizing Social Networks between the Maya World and
Lower Central America
Long referred to as the Mesoamerican Frontier, the Ulua Valley of northwestern Honduras
bridges the Maya Lowlands and Lower Central America. This paper explores presenting the
Ulua region in these foreign lands through the transfer of a luxury good: Late Classic marble
vases. Rare in antiquity, these vases were produced in the heart of the Ulua Valley. Yet their
importance as ambassadors of Uluan life in two very different spheres - central Maya and
Nicoya-Guanacaste - suggest very diverse perceptions of what it meant to participate in a
social network with the Ulua Valley. The multi-dimensionality of transferring a luxury good set
within the context of a place and its people allows for a more nuanced understanding of the
exotic.

[206] Why Did the Ancient Maya Build Wetland Fields at Blue Creek, Belize?
This paper explores the chronology, function, and management of Maya wetland fields with
extensive data from around Blue Creek, Belize. We first assess two major hypotheses to
explain the motives for construction. The first is that high Maya populations in the Classic
Period spurred intensive food production. The second is that sea level rise from the Preclassic
to Classic drove up ground water tables, and the Maya built canals to manage water quality
and quantity. Our data from Blue Creek, Belize provide clear evidence for the second
hypothesis, but also show intensive management amidst high populations through the Classic
Period.

[37] How Much Geographic Space in Zooarchaeological Studies of Bilaterally Paired Bones?
Zooarchaeologists have refit or conjoined fragments of bones and identified members of
bilateral pairs of skeletal elements. Bilateral pairs have been identified using morphological
attributes and/or metrical symmetry. The same degree of metric bilateral symmetry of North
American elk (wapiti) astragali in modern and prehistoric elk is assumed. Granting this
assumption, two contemporaneous archaeological sites about 4 kilometers apart suggest
intervillage elk hunts and carcass distributions took place between 1400 and 1800 A.D. This
begs the question of how much geographic space to draw bone samples from when in search
of bilateral pairs.

[66] Earthen Wall Construction During the Ohio Hopewell Era
For many years, archaeologists devoted little attention to the earthen walls that formed the
earthen enclosures associated with Hopewell sites in southern Ohio. Recent investigations
document that a wide range of different construction techniques were used to build earthen
embankments. These likely reflect differing strategies adopted by different social groups, but
may also reflect an evolution of building techniques through time. Construction of a single
earthen enclosure site represents a major investment of labor, but construction of the
Hopewell landscape in southern Ohio is awe inspiring.

[138] The Kayenta Diaspora and Group Identities in the American Southwest
The topic of migration has dominated recent archaeological research in the American

improved chronometric, distributional, and provenance data, and advances in diaspora theory,
it is now possible to explore the interplay of place and collective identity among displaced
ancient groups. This paper examines the prehispanic diaspora from the Kayenta region of
northeastern Arizona and southeastern Utah through the study of patterns in architecture,
ceramics, and ritual that consciously and unconsciously reflect group identities.

The precolonial Wandala state is well-attested from historical sources in the southern Lake

However, the social and political organisation of Wandala statehood, and especially the
material correlates of that statehood, appear curiously ambiguous. It is difficult to delineate a
Wandala state as a functioning sociopolitical system away from the capital, and even more
difficult to identify the origins of that state in the material record. This ambiguity is in large part
due to Wandala negotiation of ethnic and political identities on local and sub-continental

deposits beneath an alluvial terrace of the lower Medina River in south-central Texas. The
cultural deposits are associated with the modern surface soil and four buried soils developed
in a 15-m-thick package of fine-grained flood deposits. An assemblage of 40 radiocarbon ages
determined on charcoal and decalcified soil carbon place the cultural record into a well-defined
chronology. This paper describes the geomorphology, stratigraphy, paleopedology, and
geochronology of 41BX831. Site formation processes also are considered.

[148] On (not quite) Resisting the Market: A Conservative Miami Household from the War of
1812 Era
In the early nineteenth century the Forks of the Wabash was home to Miami Indians who were
attempting to adhere to a conservative version of Miami identity. Among the proscriptions
being touted by ideological leaders such as the Shawnee Prophet was a rejection of Euro-
American material goods. At the same time, some Euro-American commodities had become
constitutive components of "traditional" Miami identity. This paper examines the material
expressions of identity at a conservative Miami household uncovered at the Ehler site in
northeastern Indiana.

[148] Negotiating Borders: Southern Caddo and Colonial Governments in East Texas ca. 1775
to 1850
Early historic Caddo benefited from their position on the border of rival colonial governments,
but a great deal changed after the French ceded Louisiana to Spain (1767). Spanish settlers
and soldiers abandoned the area and the amount of trade goods from France decreased. The
following century was characterized by changing and competing colonial powers, developing
economies, Native hostilities, and epidemics, thus forcing the relocation and coalescing of
many Caddo tribes. Using archival documents and archaeological evidence from sites in east
Texas I discuss how Caddo groups maintained ethnic and group identities while adapting to
the changing political and economic landscape.

[18] New Studies on Clay Figurines from Southern Tamaulipas and Northern Veracruz
As in other Mesoamerican cultures, clay figurines from the Huasteca are associated with
fertility cults and funerary offerings. Particularly abundant in Southern Tamaulipas and
Northern Veracruz, figurines were an important feature of Huastec culture from the Preclassic
through Postclassic periods. Unfortunately, lack of archaeological context has limited scientific
investigations, which have progressed little since Ekholm’s and MacNeish’s foundational
publications. This paper synthesizes new information pertaining to Huastec figurines through
analysis of unpublished material. Ekholm’s typology is completed with evidence from well-
preserved figurines and several new categories are proposed. Socio-cultural approaches,
which contribute to the identification and significance of figurines, are also discussed.

[53] The Secondary Products Revolution – Zooarchaeological Foundations and their Current
Critique
Andrew Sherratt is perhaps best known for the concept of a ‘Secondary Products Revolution’,
which stressed that the ‘primary’ pattern of domesticated animals exploitation for meat in early
Neolithic was followed by a more diversified exploitation of secondary applications and
products such as milk, wool, textile, and traction power. The paper will debate how changes in
animal exploitation in the European Neolithic, including secondary uses and products, can be
interred from faunal remains. It will also challenge a meat-based livestock-rearing system of
early European farmers and stress an idiosyncratic nature of introduction of secondary
products in particular areas of Europe.

[132] Categories of Complexity and the Preclusion of Practice
The recent proliferation of new societal analytical categories and the continued use of old ones
has drawn attention away from the very practices, strategies, and negotiations that produced
social complexity in the late Prehistoric Southeast. Polemic debates over the size and
complexity of Mississippian polities have similarly masked considerable organizational
variation that existed among and within Mississippian polities. Faced with these problems we
advocate the abandonment of macroscale, structuralist frameworks in favor of an approach
that focuses on the generative practices of small-scale social groups. We consider
Mississippian data sets from west-central Alabama and adjacent areas to illustrate this
critique.

[41] Newly Discovered Hunter's Shelter, SE New Mexico: Archaic or Late Prehistoric
Pictographs?
A small (4m by 4m), high cliff-side limestone shelter with three significant red pictograph
panels was discovered in 2005. The Hunter's Shelter contains a centrally located standing
deer or elk, a rare butchering scene of a similar animal, and a complex panel of small figures
(each a few centimeters or less). This unique scene appears to depict hunters holding curved
sticks (one holding a rabbit), nets, rabbits, and dogs. The images have similarities to the Red
Linear Style found in the Lower Pecos River rock art region of Texas as well as to late
prehistoric sites in Southern Colorado.

[103] Sasamal Performance: Variability in Ritual Contexts at El Peru-Waka’
In recent years, greater archaeological consideration has been giving to sub-royal and non-
elite domestic ritual performance in complex societies. Although evidential emphasis varies,
these studies have generally drawn inferences of past performance from the physical context
– the “stage” – of ritual, as well as its material components. Despite this recent trend, the
majority of investigation into ritual performance in the Maya area remains focused on status-
reinforcing spectacle by Classic Maya rulers. Examination of the varying contexts of
performance within the Classic period center of El Peru-Waka’ indicates that certain rituals
were used to produce localized identities within non-royal residential precincts.

A "yoni" is a rock feature found in southern California that resembles the human female
genitalia. A joint investigation by PCR Services Corporation and the Pechanga Band of
Luiseno Indians has recently identified cluster of more than 30 yoni features in western
Riverside County, California. Other examples of these features have been identified in
association with Late Prehistoric archaeological sites in San Diego County as well. Contextual
information drawn from Native American interviews, ethnographic literature, and
archaeological associations strongly suggest that these yoni features are related to the
Luiseno Girls' Ceremony.

Marcadas Pueblo, Albuquerque, NM
Non-destructive geophysical and geospatial investigations at Piedras Marcadas Pueblo are
beginning to shed new light on the size, composition and organization of a large prehistoric-
historic pueblo (~1150-1650 AD) in the Rio Grande Valley. By agreement with the landowners
and site stewards (i.e., the City of Albuquerque, NPS and local Native American communities),
non-intrusive investigations at Piedras Marcadas are preferred. A range of complementary,
non-destructive approaches focusing on resistivity have greatly enhanced current
understanding about this pueblo. These results highlight the spatial organization of the pueblo
providing a powerful visual medium for site interpretation and management.

[128] Assessing Evolutionary Relationships across the Northern Pacific using Phylogenetic
Analyses
Heuristic cultural and chronological phylogenies, based on field experience, intuitive
relationships, and key types, are commonly employed in the north to assess relationships
across space and time. This is a very successful strategy and one that is gaining in
sophistication. Mathematical phylogenetic trees, based on assessing similarities using the
properties of things in a complex computer simulation are also gaining in importance in
archaeology. These trees require different kinds of data and result is sometimes startling
relationships. Both methods are employed here to assess spatial and temporal sequences and
to better understand the evolutionary history of the north Pacific.

[137] Domestic Architecture and Use of Space at Khonkho Wankane
Domestic spaces at Khonkho, like other areas of this Late Formative ceremonial center, were
the product of well-planned and executed architectural plans. Reminiscent of modern, cookie-
cutter suburban residences, preliminary ceramic and architectural analysis reveal deviations
over time to this rigid architectural tradition. Situated within closed spaces and large
compound walls, some residential neighborhoods enjoyed preferential access to non-domestic
and religious spaces. A relatively small population occupied these houses year-round, but the
nature of that population, and the relationships to the site's temporary visitors, remains
unclear.

[156] Reconstructing the Functions of Domestic and Industrial Space through Charcoal
Analysis at Gordion, Turkey
Carbonized plant remains are often used to understand ancient diet and environment on a
site-wide or regional scale, but are used less often to understand how household and
industrial areas functioned within an ancient settlement. Wood charcoal is created through
various activities and distributed within a site by distinct depositional processes. Identification
of these at the scale of individual rooms can aid in reconstructing the functional history of
those spaces. Analysis of over 1,000 charcoal samples from more than 2,000 years of
occupation at Gordion, Turkey, shows synchronic variation and diachronic change in cultural
practice at that site.

Patagonian ecosystems at the time of the first human exploration and colonization of the
region. These sites, which are characterized by the accumulation of dung, bones and plants,
were sometimes used by humans as sources of food, shelter and other resources. Their study
is useful for the analysis of human interactions with megamammals.

In recent decades, archaeological excavations in Central and South Texas have uncovered a

Why these cemeteries were created and what they might say about past social dynamics is
unclear. To address these questions, my research explores variability in grave goods at the
Crestmont site, a cemetery on the Texas Gulf Coast containing 31 burials, and then examines
the site in relation to regional mortuary patterns. Possible contributing factors for differential
burial include variation in patterns, regional interaction, increasing sedentism, and changes in
political structure.

The regional settlement survey of an area of 160 km² in the Jamastrán Valley identified
prehispanic settlements and established settlement hierarchies in the valley, as well as the
relationships between settlement patterns and agricultural production, local craft production
and exchange, and interregional interaction. Data collected during fieldwork provided evidence
of human occupation that spans from the Terminal Preclassic/Early Classic to the Late Classic
Period (300-1000 AD). The evidence suggests an increase in the number of settlements,
population, and interregional connections during the Late Classic Period.

[38] Changing Lithic Technologies and Residential Mobility During the Archaic to Basketmaker
II Transition
The transition from Archaic to Basketmaker II in the American Southwest marks a shift from an
economy based on mobile hunting and gathering to a relatively sedentary lifeway relying on
maize horticulture. The lithic technology at 23 sites in southern Utah, indicate that during the
latter phase of Basketmaker II a shift occurred from a formal tool technology to an expedient
one. Previous studies have demonstrated that prehistoric hunter-gatherer societies relied on a
formal tool technology and sedentary societies on expedient tools. This suggests that early
Basketmaker II populations remained relatively mobile during the incipient use of maize.

[49] Human burial variability in the lower basin of the Colorado River during the Late Holocene
(Buenos Aires province, Argentina)
An important variability of mortuary practices has been detected in the lower basin of the
Colorado river. Whereas for the early late Holocene (2800-800 yrs BP) only primary burials
were detected, human bodies received a complex treatment during the final late Holocene
(500-300 yrs BP). Secondary burials became the most common funerary practice, the number
of individuals at sites ranges between 2 up to 55, anatomical units are usually red painted and
cut marks indicate body processing. This paper describes these funerary patterns and
explores human burial variability in the transitional geographic area of Pampa and Patagonia.

Later prehistoric occupations show a strong relationship to the north and share many of the

evidence of supervision or patronage, and the relative affluence of specialists, as reflected in
their houselot assemblages, is compared to other kinds of commoners to evaluate the benefits

external references to Masul to construct a history of the Naachtun kingdom and its place in
the Classic Maya world.

Architectural Design in the Early Bronze Age
Numerous examples of Early Bronze Age planned settlements exist in the Near East. Public
architecture such as fortifications, temples, palaces, and thoroughfares are planned by elite

projects are the purview of major, often royal, institutions. Epigraphic and archaeological
evidence for the construction of planned, non-elite housing stock, on the other hand, is more
ambiguous. This paper explores the idea that a professional class of developers was
responsible for the design of this non-elite housing stock, operating below the level of the
ruling elites but above that of the individual household.

[99] Bison, Bowls, and Bunnies; Exploring Intensification in Toyah
Toyah material culture has been linked to the return of bison to Texas. Whether following
herds into the state, or adapting in place to this new bounty, Toyah populations are often seen
as mobile hunter-gatherers with a dependence on calorie rich bison. Yet, many Toyah
components have expensive tools (e.g., ceramics) and evidence of diets that include various
lower-ranked plants and small animals (e.g., rabbits, reptiles, fish). Broad diets are not
commonly associated with a dependence on high-return animals or with high mobility. We
explore this apparent contradiction, and present a revised model of Toyah adaptation.

[4] Continuity and Change in the Fauna of the Ballona Lagoon, Los Angeles, California
Sites in the Ballona Lagoon area show remarkable continuity of faunal exploitation throughout
their occupation. Most of the occupation span strongly resembles desert and Great Basin
cultural adaptations, with a particular emphasis on non-marine aquatic resources found in
vernal pools, and on lagoonal—but not pelagic—marine resources. This pattern changes
following European contact, with a sudden emphasis on pelagic fishing. At CA-LAN-211/H,
this has resulted in the creation of a remarkably diverse and dense deposit of faunal remains.
We suspect that at least some of this deposit reflects late prehistoric and early Contact-period
ritual behaviors such as feasting.

[213] Conflict and Opportunity in Regulatory Permit Actions: Section 106 versus the California
Environmental Quality Act (CEQA)
Regulatory is the branch of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that implement portions of the
Clean Water Act. Construction permits from Regulatory are required under the Act. The
federal action of issuance of a permit gives the Corps rare jurisdiction over private land. This
authority requires that all investigations and analyses of cultural resources comply with
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act (36 CFR 800). The challenges of this
authority come most often with the choice of the "permit area" by the regulator, and the extent
and quality of existing cultural resources investigations, usually conducted under CEQA.

[127] Sunset Crater: Environmental Disaster and Human Response
The eruption of Sunset Crater Volcano in the 11th century in northern Arizona resulted in
significant alteration of the regional environment. Human response to these changes included
sizeable population migrations, changed farming practices and an altered residence pattern.
Establishing an exact eruption date and sequence is essential in understanding human
response seen in the archaeological record. Dendrochronological analysis of archaeological
wood samples reveals the nature and duration of the eruption and gives evidence of the
movement of humans into new locations. This poster will detail on-going investigations in this
area as well as the direction of future research.

[71] Pearlware Pearlware Everywhere! Utilizing Mean Ceramic Dating to Identify Landscape
Use and Reuse at Polly Hill Plantation, San Salvador, Bahamas
There are few historical references to Polly Hill, a loyalist plantation on the isolated Bahamian
"out island" of San Salvador occupied from approximately 1783 to 1838. This lack of
documentation leaves many unanswered questions regarding the daily lives of enslaved and
later liberated African populations at Polly Hill. Archaeological investigations from two seasons
of field work have yielded important evidence for understanding how the use of the local
landscape changed over time to suit people's needs, lifeways, and aesthetics. An analysis of
the ceramic assemblage from three different structures was combined with fragmentary
documentary references to learn about this historically silenced population.

[144] Ceramic Traditions and Ethnicity in Central Mali: Between Population Dynamics and
Transmission of Knowledge Regularities
While ethnologists and ethnohistorians have clearly underlined the fluidity of human groups,
ethnoarchaeologists, by contrast, have emphasized the fixity of modes of transmission of
technical knowledge within ethnolinguistic groups. Tackling the material expression of social
identities in the past requires that we transcend this apparent antagonism, by mobilizing and
confronting lines of evidence from three distinct domains: ethnoarchaeology, ethnohistory, and
archaeology. Time depth, however, coarsens the resolution of interpretations, forcing a shift of
focus from the ethnic group to the linguistic family. The issue will be illuminated by recent
research on ceramics undertaken in Mali by the University of Geneva.

[36] How Canada Geese Recorded Iroquoian Farming Around Crawford Lake
Middle Ontario Iroquois flourished AD 1200-1500. Geese fed in their cornfields before roosting
on the lake where they cast dung pellets. These pellets caused eutrophication, meromixis and
the preservation of further pellets in the sediment. Fossil pellets contain abundant pollen of
maize, squash, sunflower and purslane as well as corn smut spores. Perhaps the geese also
fertilized the maize fields thus prolonging their usefulness. Fossil pellets also contain abundant
herb charcoal derived from field burning not forest fires. Pollen succession reflects climatic
change rather than human impact on the landscape. Iroquoians flourished around Crawford
Lake during the Medieval Warm Period but during the Little Ice Age moved to a warmer
elevation by Lake Ontario.

[116] Keeping Up with the Garcias: Mexican Technologies in the Mogollon
Experts believe that southwestern artifacts show a number of traits imported into the region

technologies like basketry plaiting, and ceremonial items like cane cigarettes. An extensive
literature exists on the origins of southwestern maize, while other cultural imports, like turkeys,
cotton and plaiting, have been less intensively examined. The Tularosa Cave collection,
excavated by Paul S. Martin and recently re-cataloged, offers an opportunity to analyze early
examples of objects with potentially Mexican antecedents, allowing explanation for when and
how these technologies might have arrived into the Mogollon.

of raw material economy in the context of increased mobility away from sources of raw

One objective of archaeological research is to place prehistoric cultural phenomena into

achieve. Even though new absolute (chronometric) dating techniques have been developed in
the recent past, they cannot always be used due to certain limitations (i.e., cost and

not susceptible to the aforementioned restrictions. This poster will present the use of a relative
dating technique recently introduced in northern Arizona to date prehistoric Cohonina pottery

sacrificial offerings to ensure the well being of humans and good harvests. Here we discuss
the ethnographic and archaeological information on Lacandon ritual in caves, cliffs, and

with the past; they are locales where individuals communicate with supernatural agents on
behalf of living humans. Although physically ‘outside’ Lacandon society these beings are
manifested in Lacandon ceremonial landscapes and material culture.

Although the situation is by no means monolithic, a general sense of distrust characterizes

context of urban renewal and gentrification; archaeologists participating in these projects are
thus seen as encroachers. The archaeological political battles that often take place as a

agency practice in the Lone Star State vis- à -vis African-Americans and Indigenous

Southwestern archaeologists once imagined northern Mexico as a great empty quarter that set
the Southwest apart from Mesoamerica. Itinerant merchants, migrating peoples, roving raiders
and wandering explorers crisscrossed this desert wilderness. Today, archaeologists working in
México have transformed this picture. Instead of movement and migration, they have found
local developments that created both diversity and continuity. This diversity and continuity
calls into question theories of cultural development in the Southwest that depend upon
migrants or travelers from the south. It also challenges the idea of a distinct boundary between
the Southwest and Mesoamerica.

Paleoecological research in Honduras elucidates the successes and failures of land-use

sustained their environment by balancing their use of field and forest products. Participation in
today’s globalized economy has led to massive deforestation and soil depletion in many areas
and successful methods for utilizing the environment have been discarded. The current level
of deforestation in Honduras was sustained only briefly in the past before nature or people
reigned in such abuse. A return to traditional land-use practices would preserve Honduras for

The archeology and history workshop came about in Mexico thanks to the coordination of the
Chihuahuan Institute of Culture with BLM, the New Mexico Department of Cultural Affairs, and
the SRI Foundation. The major points considered in organizing the workshop were as follows:
Who would teach the workshop; Translation and adequacy of the didactic materials; Venue in
which the workshop would be held; Specific information about the invited teachers and their
classes. The objective was to have the teachers take the curriculum to their classrooms, teach
it to their students, and additionally create an educational project that would involve their
community.

[33] The Color of Maize
Farmers in northern Mexico and the pueblos of the southwestern United States report using
maize kernel color in planting and other decisions. In a project conducted by Iowa State
University agronomists, many different varieties of Native American maize grown in an
identical environment under optimal conditions promoted maximum trait expression in the
plants. Here we explore the relationship between kernel color, morphological features, and
growth and development of several maize landraces to assess how closely color and plant
growth and reproductive traits are related. We focus on Puebloan varieties of maize, as these
appear to have the greatest conservation of color.

[15] Large-Scale Late Prehistoric Abandonments in the Southeastern United States:
Examining Mississippian Demographic Shifts from an Ecological Perspective
Tree-ring based reconstructions of water availability from A.D. 1200 to 1600 in the
southeastern United States, coupled with archaeological records from the Savannah and
Tennessee River valleys, are used to calculate crop yields to investigate the relationship
between Native American storage capabilities and climate fluctuations. In each case, portions
of both regions were depopulated by Mississippian peoples following prolonged droughts.
Although caution must be exercised in interpreting climate-culture relationships, the results
indicate that drought and agricultural shortfalls impacted the historical trajectories of
Mississippian societies in both river valleys, fostering declines in sociopolitical structure and
large-scale abandonments.

metamorphic such as serpentinites, travertines, and marbles. One of the most important sets
of artifacts made of serpentine are Tlaloc, god of water, and Mezcala style masks. This paper
examines the identification of process of production on the surface of these artifacts and
provides with a methodology for comparison among different regional styles.

[165] Did Folsom Paleoindians Even Notice the Younger Dryas? Thoughts on Late Glacial
Climate Change and Human Responses on the Plains
Folsom Paleoindians occupied the Plains amidst the Younger Dryas (YD), a geologically brief,
rapid return to harsh glacial conditions around the North Atlantic, with synchronous but often
variable climatic and ecological changes elsewhere. But how was the YD manifest on the
Plains: was it as severe here, or did it even have a detectable impact on human foragers or
the resources on which they depended? Assessing its effects requires understanding local
conditions (in a spatial and temporal sense). Data from the Folsom site and other localities
help piece together the paleoenvironmental stage on which Folsom adaptations may have
played out.

Over the last six years the authors conducted solar observations during zenith and nadir
passage at Palenque. The importance of zenith and nadir is reflected in the dramatic solar
alignments of the Temple of the Cross, Inscriptions and Palace. Zenith and nadir passages
also resonate in the hieroglyphic texts, from the creation event to the succession of Palenque
rulers. The interrelationship between astronomy, myth and history suggests that divine
kingship was bound by the movement of the sun. By timing royal events to pivotal solar
stations, the ruler gave potency to his role as the axis of space and time.

[146] Yndios, Mestizos, y Gente de Razon: Nativism, Syncretism, and Identity in the
Hispanicized Indian Missions of Alta California, 1769-1848
That corpus of works concerned with the colonial encounter in Alta California has grown
exponentially with the influx of recent contributions by anthropologists, archaeologists,
historians, geneticists, and linguists. Significantly, while scholars continue to expand the
playing field of colonialism and mission studies research, interrogating extant evidence for a
Mexicanized hybridity and syncretistic transformation of the native populations of Alta
California remains a formidable challenge. This paper explores the extent to which Franciscan
millenarianism and Mexican Indian cultural traditions, folk Catholic beliefs, and material
cultures ultimately transformed the social and cultural landscapes of the newly formed
Hispanicized Indian communities of California.

[109] Cultural Interactions and the Construction of Local Identities in SW China during the Late

This paper discusses the archaeological material from the slate and megalithic tombs of the
late Bronze Age and early Iron Age in Sichuan and Yunnan. Analysis of the distribution and
combination of specific classes of material and stylistic attributes suggests that regional
interactions existed across Tibet, Sichuan and Yunnan. The identified variability also shows
that similar funerary traditions developed in fact into localised and often hybrid forms, where
the integration, imitation or discard of certain materials and attributes can be interpreted as
evidence of an on-going process of adjustment and redefinition of group identities at local
level.

[108] Gender and Jakaltek Cave Use
My role as the only woman on an ethnoarchaeological field project studying ritual cave use
forced me to confront a host of Jakaltek Maya gender related values linked to caves. The
widely documented prohibition against women entering caves was consistently reaffirmed by
male informants. In actual practice, a good deal of variation exists in behavior by women,
including one case that appears to indicate women have fundamentally different values.
Finally, much of the taboo against women surrounds the menstrual cycle. Jakaltek attitudes
toward male versus female blood are analyzed in specific examples.

chronologically in a 14ha sector located at the north of the Ceremonial Center. This area is
composed by five subsectors that include trash areas, workshops and platforms of different

Pueblo III can tell us much about the choices made when determining where to live and what
they did when the best places were no longer available. A comparison of Pueblo III pristine
and reinhabited sites across four surveys from southwestern Colorado can help tease out the
importance of such influences as population and aggregated sites and illuminate the
importance of social, economic and environmental forces.

[143] The Maya Venus Almanac
The Venus almanac is well documented in the Postclassic Dresden Codex. Venus imagery is
linked to warfare in the codices and Postclassic murals. Earlier evidence of the almanac is
seen in Maya imagery related to Tlaloc, the year-sign, and sets of five and eight in visual arts.
The Classic and Terminal Classic Maya linked military campaigns to the cycle of Venus
events, recording such events in militaristic imagery and inscriptions referring to “Star Wars.”
Ultimately, Teotihuacan may be the origin point of this basic cycle integrating an eight-year
solar period with five Venus cycles and 99 lunar months.

[95] Exploring the Land: A Comparison of Land-Use Patterns in the Middle and Upper
Paleolithic of the Western Mediterranean
By examining the patterning of artifacts across a physical landscape, prehistoric behavior
regarding land-use can be delineated. Analysis of geographic and lithic variables, using survey
data from three valleys in eastern Spain, demonstrates this for the Middle and Upper
Paleolithic. Significant differences between time periods would support the idea that the
Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition coincided with changes in land-use. Results indicate that
the occupation of Mediterranean Spain was spatially patterned in relation to topography.
However, there is little evidence for a difference in land-use between the Middle and Upper
Paleolithic for any of the studied valleys.

[133] Cultural and Ethnic Identities in Early Iron Age Burials of Eastern Inner Asia
The socio-political and ethnic assumptions inherent in culture-historical names ascribed to
burial sites excavated in Eastern Inner Asia have oversimplified the complex issue of identity
for those interred. In the case of the Xiongnu nomadic confederacy, we propose to individually
address variables of material culture (grave structure, manner of internment, burial goods) and
human remains (cranial and dental non-metric traits, diet, disease load) from sites throughout
Mongolia and northern China. The dynamics apparent between these variables of the material
remains may then help to inform us of social, economic and political dynamics in Eastern Inner
Asia during the Early Iron.

Researchers have long been intrigued by the terracotta cakes and nodules of the Indus,

ammunition. In spite of their ubiquity, however, very few studies of these objects have been
undertaken, and they have frequently been confused with materials indicative of high-
temperature firing. Some of the assumptions made about the functions of these nondescript
objects have led to large-scale misunderstandings about the activities occurring at Indus sites.
I untangle the diversity of object types involved and suggest some techniques for identifying
associated activities.

The exploitation of bison was central to the faunal economy of most protohistoric Great Plains

little data has been generated on the exploitation and representation of Bison at village sites.
The Dirt Lodge Village (39SP11) was a significant Yanktonai Sioux habitation site on the

Lodge, will allow a greater understanding of how the Yanktonai based their economy and

[33] Did the Bow and Arrow Increase Foraging Efficiency for High and Low-Rank Taxa in
North-Central Texas?
The advent of the bow and arrow is often characterized as an important technological
advancement during the Late Prehistoric in north-central Texas because it confers greater
hunting efficiency. However, based on the number of taxa exploited, most researchers argue
that subsistence changed little with a broad-spectrum hunting strategy being utilized during
both the Late Archaic and the Late Prehistoric periods. This study takes a more detailed look
at changes in foraging efficiency with the adoption of the bow and arrow by examining not only
richness, but by investigating the possibility that high-ranked resources were harvested at a
relatively higher rate.

Ancient Agricultural Economies
Some aspects of ancient economies are best studied at the level of site and phase rather than
sample by sample. Controlling for context of use (remains of bones as food and seeds as
fuel), we show that the subsistence economy at Gordion integrated wild and domesticated
plants and animals in an archaeologically recognizable pattern. Proportions of bones of food
animals and the ratio of seeds of wild plants to cereals vary according to periods when herding
or farming were emphasized at Gordion (Early Iron Age to medieval times). Orientation toward
farming was greatest at Middle Phrygian Gordion (King Midas's era).

societies and how migration became such a fundamental part of Puebloan oral traditions.

the role of chiefly sponsorship and craft specialization in Hawaiian lithic procurement
strategies, and illuminate the benefits of large-scale EDXRF analyses in addressing such

differences exist between the blades from units 3a and 3b; and (3) most blades that exhibit
usewear show little polish, suggesting ephemeral use. This study also illustrates broader
implications for microwear and quarry/workshop research and analysis.

[81] Generalists or Specialists? Exploring the Stereotype of Female Graduate Students
This paper examines generalist versus specialist approaches to archaeology and how these
approaches affect female graduate students. There are pressures at work in traditional
programs that lead to females being channeled into specialist sub-fields (e.g.,
paleoethnobotany) rather than being generalists. Programs with a generalist approach
produce students, even students in a specialty like zooarchaeology, to be generalists first in
both theory and practice. This paper presents some thought as to why the specialist
stereotype exists including family issues and fieldwork concerns and provides personal insight
on the influence of a generalist course of study.

[112] Crossing the Divide: Archaeology as Indigenous History
Since the Columbian Quincentennial in 1992, archaeologists have made steady progress in
breaking down institutional, methodological, and epistemological barriers to the study of
interaction between Europeans and Native North Americans during the last 500 years.
However, theoretical obstacles remain. Many of these can be traced to colonial-period
discourses about the differences between indigenous and European societies that were
accepted during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by the fledgling field of
anthropology. Archaeologists are well positioned to challenge these ideas, but to do so they
will need to rethink many of the key concepts they use to study the past.

[47] Salt Production in the Mid-Nineteenth Century on St. Charles Bay, Texas
Site 41AS95 represents a salt production facility that operated between the 1830's and the
1860's near the town of Lamar, Texas. Salt was an extremely valuable commodity during
these decades, and this salt works may have provided a necessary staple for growing
communities in the Republic of Texas and for Confederate garrisons during the Civil War.
Survey and excavation completed in 2005 and 2006 provide new data that helps to illuminate
the processes used to produce salt as well as the function of the salt works in the community
of Lamar and on the Texas coast.

[144] In the Belly of Dan: Space and the Politics of Ethnicity in Precolonial Dahomey
Dahomey emerged as a small polity in coastal West Africa in the seventeenth century AD. As
Dahomey became a central player in the Atlantic slave trade, it extended authority over many
neighboring Huedan, Aja, Mahi and Yoruba communities. This resulted in the massive
relocation of people into and within the kingdom, resulting in ethnically heterogeneous urban
communities. In Dahomey space, ethnicity, and elite power strategies were closely
intertwined. This paper explores the nature of multi-ethnic towns in Dahomey, and the spatial
strategies employed by elite to impose political order: from the construction of palaces, to the
design of urban communities.

[26] Trade, Transit, and Pilgrimage in the Alta Verapaz Land Trade and Transport Route
Recent research in northern Verapaz in shrines and associated settlements revealed the
shifting of the highland-lowland cultural border, the changing utilization of the great western
trade route, and the effects of eventual control by the Late Classic kingdom of Cancuen. The
region is largely unoccupied before AD 600 but shrines were used by distant highland and
lowland populations. A large population influx from the highlands in the Late Classic shifted
the border north and the new populations began to control ritual activity and perhaps the route
itself.

[145] The Impact of Early Farming on the Mediterranean Landscape: Preliminary Results from
the Investigation of Two Neolithic Villages in Dalmatia
Excavations at two village sites near the Dalmatian coast, Danilo and Pokrovnik, have yielded
significant samples of plant remains and animals bones that provide evidence for their
economies during the Early and Middle Neolithic. Studies of the modern landscape, including
vegetation, geomorphology and site catchment, afford points of departure for interpreting the
Neolithic evidence. Interviews with local farmers yield insights on traditional agricultural
practices that illuminate ecological factors operating in the past and the present. The research
demonstrates the necessity of employing a variety of field studies to understand the impact of
the inception of farming.

[19] Native Resistance to Spanish Incursions in La Florida: The Juan Pardo Expeditions of
1566-1568
Spanish accounts of 16th century expeditions in the American Southeast describe a variety of
indigenous responses ranging from cooperation to large scale conflict. The native town of
Joara, in western North Carolina, represents a locale in which the Spanish expedition under
Juan Pardo experienced the full range of indigenous responses. Investigations at the Berry
site appear to confirm Spanish accounts suggesting that Joarans were initially cooperative in
meeting Pardo’s demands for assistance in the construction of Fort San Juan (1567), but
eighteen months later they destroyed this Colonial venture in actions analogous to the better
known Pueblo Revolt of 1680.

[56] Environmental Imperatives Redux: Rethinking Late Holocene Climate Change and Its
Effect on Sociocultural Evolution
The Western Mono migrated to the western slope of the Sierra Nevada, California, displacing
more sedentary groups some 600 years ago. They did so during a shift to Little Ice Age
conditions, a period typically characterized as one of environmental ameliorization. Recent
research, however, indicates these conditions increased the temporal and spatial variability of
resource distribution. The Mono averaged this variability with dispersed food caching,
resource transport, and mobility, behaviors conferring them a competitive advantage over
other groups. This research thus indicates that conditions often thought of as benign can be
stressing and selective within the context of cultural evolution.

As archaeologists we know that people have long demonstrated an interest in inscribing the

important advances in the archaeology of the Formative period, contributing to our

[69] (Un)Dying Loyalty: Meditations on Retainer Sacrifice
The ritualized death of the captive, the virgin, or the scapegoat to thank, nourish and/or
appease the gods is much theorized. Retainer sacrifice is less often so, save as a particularly
dramatic example of conspicuous consumption or “waste” in early states. The socially
sanctioned violence perpetrated on the intimates and underlings of a ruling elite, however,
reveals the radically changing notions of divine right, rank, and property that together actively
enabled the creation of the state. This paper employs diverse evidence to explore the
dialectics between the elites who instituted the practice and the communities that—for a time
at least—condoned it.

[69] Greeks Bearing Arms: Civilization and the Decline of Everyday Violence, 700- 400 BCE
In ancient Greece weapons almost completely disappeared from burials, individual dedications

sources tell us that by 400 BCE bearing arms and resolving disputes through violence were
both seen as primitive. This paper links the abandonment of weapons and self-help to three
other processes: the emergence of the new persona of the male citizen in an egalitarian city-
state; the movement of armed combat to increasingly ritualized inter-state warfare; and a new
idea of “Greek” civilization, defined in part against arbitrary violence.

Extensive and severe erosion seen in the Nochixtlán Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico is often
attributed to European agricultural practices. Our research indicates that environmental
degradation and subsequent erosion was related to demographic changes occurring much
earlier during the Formative and Classic Periods. Population increases during times of urban
grown led to an increase in agricultural land and additional hillside land clearance. Subsequent
erosion resulted in valley alluviation and the burial of existing landscapes. Recent incision
revealed these landscapes in the form of paleosols which were radiocarbon dated and showed
most of the erosion occurred prior to Spanish occupation.

1931, archaeologists and the public alike have been puzzling over the location and function of
the site, which we call Wits Cah Ak'al, comprised of multiple large earthen mounds. Since
2005, a team led by Patricia A. McAnany has been conducting the first-ever intensive research
there and have accumulated evidence suggesting it was one of many Classic Period Maya
salterns now known along the Caribbean coast of Belize. Survey in 2005/2006 and excavation
this spring are providing the first solid answers to the puzzle.

contrast to previous views of these tombs as a monolithic entity, which stressed the similarities
among the tombs and related communities, this paper emphasizes the architectural,
artifactual, and chronological differences among them. This study reveals the dynamic choices
of individual communities in the use of similar burial forms and underlines the subtle but real
variations in the functions of the tombs and how they relate to the nuanced micro-ideologies of
the region.

[19] Inca Resistance to Spanish Colonization: Violent Uprising and Nonviolent Resistance at
Puruchuco-Huaquerones
With bioarchaeological data from the Inca cemetery (circa 1450-1560) of Puruchuco-
Huaquerones, this paper explores how one community engaged in both violent and non-
violent tactics to resist Spanish colonization and domination on the central coast of Peru.
Atypical patterns of trauma combined with a high frequency of perimortem injuries indicate that
individuals from Puruchuco-Huaquerones engaged in violent conflict and challenge written
sources that deny the participation of communities from the central coast in violent uprising
against the Spanish. These data also illuminate how these communities resisted the
extirpation campaigns directed at traditional Andean mortuary practices and ancestor worship.

[154] Painted Indian Cave:(41BC1): A Central Texas Ritual Site
41BC1 is one of the rare rock art sites found on the Edwards Plateau. The setting was
probably viewed as having supernatural importance, being not just a cave but also a cave
alongside rapids whose sound is non-stop. Around 750 BP pictographs were executed that
were inspired by the appearance of bison in central Texas. The presence of bison led to
significant changes in the native cultures possibly causing both stress and apprehension or
conversely elation and joy because bison is a highly valued food source. In either case, rituals
held in the cave would be a means of expressing and containing such emotions.

[11] Landscapes of Ancestors? The Structuring of Space Around Iron Age Funerary
Monuments in Central Europe
Large-scale archaeological explorations in southern Germany are increasingly revealing an
intensive and extensive structuring of space that served to organize action and guide
movement across the landscape. This structuring focused attention and physical action on
paramount funerary monuments. These revelations support the contention that ancestor
veneration, in the form of monumental constructions for the dead and the long-term use and
maintenance of these monuments by Iron Age communities, was a central process in a
transformation of the landscape that reflects conflict and the dynamic negotiation of power
relations between rival polities during a period of rapid social change.

[33] The Geoarchaeology of a Late Prehistoric Water Management Feature in Central New
Mexico
During a survey in the Chupadera Arroyo Basin of central New Mexico, a water management
feature was identified at the late prehistoric site of Pueblo Oso Negro. Most functional
interpretations regarding these features are based on assumption rather than being founded
on evidence corroborating the presence of water. During test investigations a subsurface
water source was identified within the depression. A geoarchaeological analysis of sediments
from the feature yielded geological evidence and invertebrate remains that indicate a past
water-rich environment. This evidence substantiates the interpretation that the depression
functioned as a water control feature for the prehistoric community.

This paper investigates the quantity, time depth, and areal extent of the Ch’en hieroglyphs in

differences between them remains poorly understood. The primary focus will be on: (1)
identifying whether particular variants of the Ch’en glyph are associated in texts with specific
ritual actions (i.e. verb phrases); (2) identifying the chronological usage of each variant to
investigate whether variants had an evolutional cycle of use and disuse; (3) investigating the
possibility that different variants refer to different types of caves.

[94] Technological Variability in Tanged Point Production During the Incipient Jomon of Japan
This paper describes research of flake scar orientation on tanged points produced by oblique
parallel pressure flaking (OPPF) during the Incipient Jomon of Japan. The results indicate a
highly significant geographically conditioned pattern of technological variation. Generally,
OPPF points from the midwest are flaked from the lower left to the upper right, while points
from the northeast are flaked from the lower right to the upper left. Experimental evidence
suggests that this variation may indicate the adoption of different pressure flaking techniques
in these two regions. Implications for previous interpretations of cultural variability are also
discussed.

Environmental Change
A major focus of New Zealand zooarchaeological research has been on the effects of
anthropogenic environmental change. Faunal data demonstrate significant changes in
population abundances and distributions of native fauna after Polynesian colonization. The
human consequences of these faunal changes have also been considerable; these include
increased energy input and mobility to extract comparable returns from declining availability of
faunal resources. More recently, zooarchaeological studies have come full circle. Applied
research is using prehistoric faunal data to more accurately identify areas on which to focus
management efforts for expanding ranges of relict populations of threatened or endangered
native fauna.

denies the possibility of variation, declaring that if you can argue about whether a society was

perpetuates the use of societal types and ignores the significance of much of the region's

systems were substantially reorganized, spurred largely by the intensification and
centralization of long distance metal trade. This study of Maros River cultures demonstrates
significant changes in animal economies paralleling these developments, including local

political office. These propositions are illustrated with the example of the Tata Rey, a staff
used as the main emblem of office by traditional political authorities in the Andes since early
colonial times. Similar practices were associated with some prehispanic weapons, such as
axes, which were simultaneously understood as animated entities and as embodiments of
collective power.

[105] Architecture and Aggregation on the Pajarito Plateau: Case Studies from the Land
Conveyance and Transfer Project
One of the most compelling aspects of archaeological research is understanding how people
come together to form communities. While communities are organized in a wide variety of
ways, there are recurring and recognizable patterns. Population aggregation appears to have
been one of the primary ways in which communities formed on the Pajarito Plateau in northern
New Mexico between A.D. 1200 and 1550. Recent research on the plateau, as part of the
Land Conveyance and Transfer project, has provided information about aggregation. This
paper provides examples of the ways in which archaeologists can use architectural evidence
to measure ancient aggregation.

[175] Pottery Production in a Prehispanic Chiefdom in the Philippines: A Geochemical
Perspective
Recent research in the Philippines suggests that the rise of large-scale, politically dominant
polities in the millennium preceding Spanish colonization was accompanied by changes in
many aspects of political economy, including greater centralization and specialization of craft
production. This paper discusses approaches to studying pottery production in the prehispanic
Philippine chiefdom of Tanjay, focusing on preliminary results of geochemical analysis of
archaeological ceramics and clay samples using laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-
mass spectrometry and what they reveal about changes in ceramic production from A.D. 500
to 1600. Contributions from ethnohistoric and ethnographic research and ethnoarchaeological
observations also are presented.

[112] A Cross-Cultural Study of Subsistence and Food Choice among Indigenous
Communities Following European Contact
Studies of subsistence and food choice provide an important perspective on the changing
social, political, and economic worlds of native people living free from direct daily involvement
with colonials in western North America. Drawing on research from several Historic era
socially indigenous villages on the northern Channel Islands, the south central California
interior, and the Fraser River Valley of southern British Columbia, this paper explores the role
of food in expressions of status and political authority, assertions of plural and changing
identities, ideologies of resistance, and adaptations to changing environmental and economic
conditions.

[150] Experiments in Prismatic Blade Production: Lessons for Archaeological Interpretation
Blades and blade-cores are nearly ubiquitous on Ohio Hopewell sites. The degree of skill
required for blade production has played a role in interpretations of Hopewell settlement
patterns (e.g., Cowan 2006); however, the level of skill required for their production is debated.
We attempt to assess how variations in skill/experience level are reflected in quantitative and
qualitative variability in the assemblage. Additionally, we compare our experimental blades to
those from archaeological contexts to gain insights into time requirements for blade
production, probable removal techniques employed, and formation processes associated with
Hopewell blade assemblages.

[201] From “Native American” to “Indigenous”: The Pluses and Perils of Greater Inclusiveness
in Archaeological Discourse
This paper examines the developments of ‘indigenous’ archaeology and the implications of
this discursive voice within and beyond the discipline. It takes the view that the use of
‘indigenous’ as a more inclusive term to ‘Native American’ is a strategic move by a small
community within the discipline that has implications that are both beneficial and problematic.
Using the framework used in recent research by the ethnographer Kirk Dombrowski, which
blends elements of political economy and identity politics, this paper will explore this
contradiction and the potential future directions of this discursive turn in archaeology.

Soon after the Huedan Kingdom entered trans-Atlantic systems of exchange in the mid-17th
century AD, Dahomean troops from the Abomey area razed the Huedan palace at Savi (1727
AD). This military operation provided Dahomey with unimpeded access to coastal trading
routes and effectively ended efforts by Huedan kings to administer the ethnically diverse and
often contentious communities surrounding Savi. This paper explores landscape features used
to negotiate social boundaries separating palace and countryside and by Dahomean kings to
mark the political boundaries of their newfound territories.

Teotihuacan was at the height of its power and Axotlan was likely subordinate to it. Analysis of

1300
Rapid cooling and sea-level fall during the transition from the Medieval Warm Period to the
Little Ice Age was accompanied by an increase in storminess in many parts of the tropical
Pacific. The consequent environmental changes led to profound and enduring effects on most
Pacific Island societies. Conflict became widespread as coastal settlements were abandoned
in favor of upland, inland (often fortified) settlements. Long-distance cross-ocean Interaction
ceased. Externally-driven change is superior to internal changes (such as those associated
with population growth or resource mismanagement) as an explanation for the observed
societal crisis at this time.

Survey in the Saraguro region in the southern highlands of Ecuador shows that manipulation

This included establishing their administrative site, Willkamarka, alongside the sacred hill of
León Dormdio, routing roads to pass by sacred places, and building a roadside usnu and a
ceremonial site, Ingapirca. The Incas also modified prominent natural features, such as
waterfalls and bedrock outcrops. This manipulation of the ceremonial landscape is seen as a
strategy of control that combined the cooption of local religious sites with imposition of state

while the later Qayjuu Phase (ca. 1,000 BP to contact) is characterised by specialized
economies dominated by salmon. The shift to a salmon-focused economy in Haida Gwaii
occurs much later than on much of the Northwest Coast, and has implications for general

The nature of vertebrate resource procurement along the Gulf Coastal Plain during the

evidence from Bayou St. John, Baldwin County, Alabama, indicates that inhabitants of the site

Evidence of a long or earlier occupation is weak. Since Spanish Camaná was founded in

mortuorios y ofrendas conocidos como estilo Chen Chen. Sin embargo, en las excavaciones
realizadas el año 2005 en los cementerios 28 y 29 del sitio Chen Chen (M1), sector 28
presenta el estilo característico Chen Chen, mientras que en sector 29, se encontró fosas con
entierros flexionados y echados de costado; con ofrendas que presentan una cantidad de
objetos metálicos y cerámica mayormente utilitaria o con formas diferentes a las ya
conocidas. Todo esto sostendría la idea de una diversidad social en la estructura Tiwanaku.

Santa Catalina’s neophyte population—the Paipai, Kumeyaay, and Kiliwa—are today among
the only indigenous groups in Baja California to maintain distinct tribal identities. This paper
will present findings from recent archaeological research at the mission site with an eye
toward understanding the persistence of native identity during the colonial period. Particular
attention will be paid to the continued engagement of neophytes with the physical and social
landscapes beyond the mission walls.

[192] Caborn-Welborn Social Boundaries
An understanding of interaction within and between archaeologically defined cultures is
important for the study of prehistoric boundaries. Social groups, ranging from household
clusters within settlements to different cultural traditions, may be bounded by social, political,
and/or economic interaction. This study explores Caborn-Welborn social boundaries through
an examination of textile-impressed ceramics and other data from the Slack Farm site
(15Un28) in Kentucky.

[97] The Multiethnicity of Ancient Tollan, State of Hidalgo: An Example of Complex Society
The stage of major brilliance in the Tollan's ancient city, State of Hidalgo, is during the
postclassic period, this one is revealed as a clear example of the social complexity in which
one lived, since in the moments of maximum expansion the city of Tula sheltered a great
population, apparently multiethnic. The present work tries to show the social interaction of
different groups that coexisted in the same zone, where it is probable that there existed
neighborhoods or sectors of people specializing in certain activity, as well as also the location
of accessions is perceived with different ethnics.

[188] The Cutting Edge: Expedient Lithic Technology and Emerging Social Complexity at San
Estevan, Belize
During the Formative Period, San Estevan in Northern Belize developed a lithic industry which
emphasized expedient lithic tools. While producers at San Estevan used mainly lesser-quality
local chalcedonies, they increasingly imported chert in raw material form from Colha as the
site developed from a small agricultural village to monumental center of an independent polity.
The ratio of cutting tools to digging implements suggests that agricultural intensification of
staple crops did not accompany increasing social complexity, but that craft production and
game from hunting practices provided the economic foundation for San Estevan’s position as
a Late Formative market community.

preserved domestic structures dating to several phases of the Ubaid period (ca. 5000-4000
B.C.). By outlining the chronology and cultural characteristics of the Ubaid complex discovered
at Kenan Tepe, this paper will emphasize both similarities that link this site to other Ubaid sites
in northern Mesopotamia, and differences that argue for an indigenous cultural development
within the Tigris piedmont during this period.

[58] Tribal Social Dynamics and the Emergence of Hereditary Inequality: A Long-Term
Perspective
This paper examines the relationship between the organization of social groups and the
emergence of hereditary inequality on the prehistoric Great Hungarian Plain. In contrast to
recent models that emphasize the role of individual human agents in enacting social
transformations, the model proposed here suggests that changes in household and settlement
organization were necessary before hereditary inequality could become formalized and
institutionalized during the Bronze Age. A theoretical perspective that deals not only with the
role of human agents, but also the long-term trajectory of social organization in a region, is
essential for modeling the emergence of ‘complexity’ generally.

[14] Owning the Past in a Post-Colonial World: Competing Claims to Archaeology in the Maya
Region
This paper explores the language of ownership of the past in the Maya region and the post-
colonial construction of claims over archaeological sites. In the context of this region,
ownership functions as a means of obtaining both cultural and political authority. Those that
seek rights to ownership over archaeological resources must work within the structure of post-
colonial society. The opening of political and civil spaces through the language of indigenism
is expanding this construct to include the rights of descendent groups over the past. Claims
within this framework challenge established ownership by providing new forms of legitimacy
for Maya stakeholders.

[16] Excavations in Naachtun's Reservoir; Classic Period Maya Water Management from the
Guatemalan, Peten
This paper presents the findings from the 2004 excavations in Naachtun’s reservoir. Situated
in the interior lowlands of the Peten the pre-Columbian Maya city of Naachtun was built next to
swampy lowland bajos and like many other Maya cities constructed a reservoir within its urban
limits to provide a reliable source of potable water. The reservoir was constructed during the
Early Classic in Naachtun IV A.D. 292/300-554 along with the surrounding architectural
platforms and was in constant use until Naachtun VI A.D. 652-790. Finding from Naachtun's
reservoir will be compared to findings from other Maya sites.

[108] Regional Pilgrimage, Caves, and the Politics of Class
Oracular cave shrines in the Maya area served state interests by legitimizing the rule and
authority of the elites. Ethnohistoric and excavation data suggest that local cave shrines were
appropriated and then expanded into larger pilgrimage networks by neighboring polities to
maintain ideological and political control over the masses. Traditionally pilgrimage in the Maya
area has been defined as an elite affair. Yet the politicalization of oracular shrines within
regional pilgrimage centers by elites suggests that such ideological messages were intended
and utilized by all classes of Maya society.

[25] Explaining Continuity: Third Time's a Charm
Archaeological explanations of long-term developments implicitly or explicitly rely on
undertheorized notions of time and continuity. This paper argues that archaeologists identify
as continuities that which should be understood as alternative temporalities. These are
constructed continuously but appear punctuated by social change only when that construction
is coordinated at large spatial scales. The point is made by adapting Soja’s notion of
thirdspace using three related American Indian examples involving cosmologies, the night sky,
and the materiality of a trans-regional episode of Mississippian narrativizing. The paper
highlights how temporalities and explanations of continuity are contingent on the materiality of
thirdtime experiences.

ranching in the Sonoran region in the eighteenth century, and also indicate that missionized
Native American groups engaged in specialized production of secondary animal products for
trade with other Spanish colonial entities, including mining communities.

Freshwater mussel shell is a common constituent of archaeological sites in Mississippi. To
date, no state-wide, comprehensive overview of the use of this resource by prehistoric
populations has been available. A thorough review of the gray literature, published works, and
the state site files suggests some broad spatial and temporal patterns in freshwater mussel
exploitation. The degree to which these patterns are real or are a product of the considerable
biases in the records is discussed, along with the implications of the data for helping to
understand prehistoric settlement and subsistence patterns in Mississippi.

In 2006, archaeologists excavated a site deeply buried in coastal sediments at Aganoa,

which were probed to 3 m. Complementary geophysical exploration (ground-penetrating radar)
revealed a series of buried beach deposits, and led archaeologists to discover a discretely
buried deposit of artifacts, generally associated with "Ancestral Polynesian" culture,
approximately 1.6 m beneath otherwise sterile sands. Preliminary analysis suggests a
prograding shoreline. An overview of the archaeological results and the geochronology is also

Are sites any better protected? What more do we need to do to reach these stakeholders?

[137] Time and Stimulus in Human Interactions: An Evaluation of the Changing Use of Space
at Irohito, Bolivia
Interaction and competition in the Lake Titicaca Basin resulted from economic, political and
strong religious ideological stimulation. The long duration of occupation at Irohito has been
crucial to understanding these situations. I suggest that the character of this interaction
determined the nature of the settlement. During the Late Formative, Irohito reached its largest
extent as a result of competitive interaction with similar groups, such as Khonkho Wankane.
During Tiwanaku 1 (AD500 – 800), some residents of Irohito moved to new locations next to
elevated areas, replicating the pattern of political integration through symbolic appropriation of
landscape found at Tiwanaku itself.

consumption of different animals, but also on defining the context and spatial distribution of
animal use providing a view into Late Formative economic, ritual, and political dynamics.

The unfortunate archaeological tradition of saturating scholarly and popular literature with

Taking the peopling of North America as its basis, and using the peoplings of Australia and
Oceania as points of comparison, this paper demonstrates that even our most scientific
renderings of the past are often nothing but dubious reflections of the status quo. Indeed, I
propose that images of peopling have slipped into not-so-subtle validations of the present,
obscuring landmark events like the first colonization of America behind academically-
sanctioned representations of Euro-Americans at the heart of prehistory.

American trade networks in exchange. Identification also is ultimately linked to discussions of
rarity.

[103] The Construction of Identity and Gender in Mortuary Ritual at El Perú-Waka'
Ancient Maya nobility compounded male and female gender concepts in the construction of
identity, and mortuary deposits provide an opportunity to examine this process. This paper
considers three interments at Waka’ that contain female nobility and denote complex
interweavings of gender and power. Analysis of the mortuary contexts and assemblages, the
health and history of the interred individuals, and epigraphic information are used to examine
the manipulation of gender and identity as an expression of power, both in the performance of
mortuary ritual and in the creation of social memory.

[79] Hunter-Gatherers in High Altitude Deserts: Perspectives from the Salt Puna
Models for hunter-gatherers living in high altitude deserts are discussed in light of the
evidence from the Salt Puna of NW Argentina. Here, despite environmental fluctuations,
uninterrupted human occupations span the entire Holocene. Although similarities with other
desert hunter-gatherers in the Americas are observed, multiple factors contributed to the
uniqueness of these societies. The role of scattered oases and the dependence on South
American camelids are presented as key issues that highlight the distinctiveness of hunter-
gatherers living in these desert environments, and are used as a tool to discuss the
advantages and limitations of models applied on a continental scale.

[10] Identifying New World Crops Through Phytolith and Starch Grain Analysis: Case Studies
from Central and South America
Research carried out during the past 25 years by a number of investigators has demonstrated
that phytoliths and starch grains from a number of important domesticated plants native to
Central and South America can be identified. They include maize, squashes and gourds of
Cucurbita spp., yams, arrowroot, and leren. Research also reveals that the microfossils from
some of these crops can be distinguished from those of their wild ancestors This paper
reviews these markers and the underlying biological processes that create them, and shows
how they are applied to document crop plant presence in human occupations from Mexico,
Panama, Ecuador, and southern South America dating to the early and middle Holocene.

to investigate Classic Period (AD 250-900) remains from the ancient Maya site of K’axob,
Belize. Here, a contextual analysis of burial placement allows consideration of the creation of
different types of ancestors. Investigation of the relationship among burial elaboration, social
identity, and paleopathologies provides a pathway into knowing something of the myriad social

[148] Cultural Hybridity, Colonial Ambivalence, and Catawba Identity, 1770-1820
In postcolonial studies, hybridization describes the process through which new cultural forms
arise from interaction between colonizers and indigenous peoples. Hybridization produces
ambivalence in colonial societies that enables the subversion of colonial power. During the
late eighteenth and early nineteenth-centuries (ca. 1770-1820), Catawbas in South Carolina
leased reservation land to Anglo settlers and worked as itinerant potters, mercenaries, and
slave catchers. Using archaeological and archival evidence, this paper examines how
ambivalence produced by these hybridization practices allowed the Catawba to maintain
considerable autonomy and construct a distinctive, non-western identity amid a society that
was increasingly hostile toward people of color.

[158] Contributions to the Study of Sociopolitical Hierarchy from a Theory of the Evolved
Capacity for Prestige
The work presented here draws on insights from evolutionary psychology and cultural
transmission theory to deepen understanding of the role prestige goods played in the
development of sociopolitical hierarchy. Drawing on costly signaling theory, I hypothesize that
prestige goods originally came into existence to signal personal levels of skill and knowledge.
The emergence of formalized leadership led to the subsequent expansion of signal content to
include social power and coercive abilities. The model's predictions for the first appearance of
prestige goods in the archaeological record are evaluated using published data sets from
independent cultural scenarios.

[197] History Matters
Approaches to the spread of agriculture have been very different in the USA and Europe. For
many Europeans, reliance on generalized models of hunter-gatherers has meant that often the
arrival of farming still signifies the beginning of meaningful pan-European or national
archaeological narratives. Europe is still within a social evolutionary cage. In north America the
possibility of direct historical analogy seems to have maintained a sense of variability and
history, even when generalizing approaches have been most valorized. This paper explores
the implications of these historical differences.

[132] The Pitfalls and Promises of Using Ethnographic Analogy to Characterize Complexity: A
Case Study from the Woodland Period Southeast
The Woodland period societies of the southeastern U.S. have long confounded categorization.
This is especially true of Kolomoki and related sites of the Gulf Coast region, where mound
building and mortuary ceremonialism became particularly elaborate, and where researchers
have employed categories ranging from “proto-chiefdom” to chiefdom to “priest-state” to
“religious hegemony.” These interpretations rely on gradualist assumptions of cultural change
and ethnographic upstreaming from the Mississippian and later periods. I argue that the
societies in this area are best understood not as pale versions of their Mississippian
counterparts, but instead as the product of distinct historical processes.

[60] Intervillage/interregional Variation in Fort Ancient Rates of Shell Temper Adoption in
Northern and Central Kentucky
In central and northern Kentucky, the earliest use of shell temper occurred during the Late
Woodland (ca. A.D. 900). From A.D. 1000 to 1400, the use of shell as temper increased at the
expense of limestone, with Fort Ancient households in northern Kentucky adopting shell
temper more quickly than those in central Kentucky. By A.D. 1400, shell was the preferred
temper in both regions. While ease of access to shell may explain pre-A.D. 1400 variation in
its use as temper, post-A.D. 1400 use of shell may be related to the introduction of new vessel
forms.

[15] The Agro-Ecology of the Mimbres Mogollon: Estimating Prehistoric Agricultural Production
During the Mimbres Classic Period
Some researchers have suggested that decreasing precipitation adversely affected
agricultural production during the A.D. 1100s, leading to the abandonment of much of the
Mimbres River valley and a redistribution of population. Crop production data (DDSAT 3.5
model) and dendroclimatological data are used to estimate prehistoric maize production during
the Mimbres Classic period. When compared to population estimates for a study area in the
middle Mimbres valley, these prehistoric crop production estimates indicate that production
was adequate to support exponential population growth, much less the estimated population.
This suggests that decline in precipitation alone was not responsible for the Mimbres Collapse.

[141] Contributions of Cave Archaeology to a Generalized and Comparative Understanding of
Mesoamerican Societies
As the number of archaeological cave projects has grown the sophistication of anthropological
research questions has increased, and concomitantly the contributions to interpretations of the
Mesoamerican past. Central has been linking cave use to concepts of a sacred Earth as a
primary and enduring orientation of Mesoamerican worldview. This orientation is linked to a
range of social behaviors including settlement choices, legitimating political power and
hereditary rulership, specialized economies, cultural boundaries, conflict, illness, healing,
mortuary treatments, and cultural responses to environmental change. This paper examines
the development of theoretical contributions of cave archaeology to generalized
understandings of Mesoamerican societies.

[75] Not Quite White Rock: The Swantek Site Ceramic Assemblage
Excavations at the Swantek Site (25PT111) in central Nebraska have revealed a large Oneota
settlement far outside traditional Oneota territory. The recovered ceramic sherds share
characteristics with Oneota pots found in both the Midwest and the Central Plains White Rock
area. However, the Swantek assemblage is striking in its uniqueness. Swantek's ceramics
suggest a 14th century migration of Oneota people that displaced indigenous Central Plains
tradition people and established a unique social network on the eastern prairies.

[14] The Archaeology of Contact and Colonialism in Petén, Guatemala
Recent research by the Proyecto Itza has shed light upon interactions between the Maya and
Spaniards both before and after the conquest of Petén, Guatemala in 1697. While preliminary,
these data suggest that two of the Maya groups in Petén before conquest, the Itza and Kowoj,
had different ways of dealing with Spanish material culture. Both groups enjoyed a longer
period of independence from the Spaniards than Yucatan or Belize. In the case of the Kowoj, it
is possible to observe how they utilized Spanish artifacts before they were dominated by the
Spaniards.

[188] Competitive State Formation in the Aegean: Heterarchy and Hierarchy
This paper examines regional patterning within two Late Bronze Age Mycenaean states in the
Aegean and raises general questions about the development of first generation secondary
states. Although the Corinthia was a geo-political periphery contested by the island state of
Kolonna, with its early dominance in sea transport, and Mycenae, with its extensive land
resources, it was the heterarchical nature of the Corinthian socio-economic landscape which
precluded the development of a hierarchical network-based state such as at Mycenae.

Planning Through GIS
Levuka, Fiji is a 19th century Pacific port town being nominated by the Fijian government to
the World Heritage List. Levuka’s rich archaeological, architectural, and cultural landscape
heritage needed to be documented for the project, but at the same time, some mechanism
needed to be developed for making the ongoing processes of consultation and decision-
making more inclusive among the town’s extremely ethnically and culturally diverse
community. This presentation discusses the experimental collaboration of a community-based
GIS project designed to meet these two goals, the results produced over the last four years of
work, and the directions planned for the future.

Water-screened samples from a historic Chinese habitation site were examined for macrofloral
remains. This site was discovered during the Valencia Gardens Housing Project in San
Francisco’s Mission District, California. The macrofloral samples were recovered in the
architectural remnants of a structure occupied by Chinese vegetable farmers before the Great
Earthquake of 1906. Macrofloral analysis suggests that the Chinese farmers were growing
and/or eating a variety of legumes and cucurbits, including peanuts, beans, soy beans, mung
beans, Chinese winter melon, watermelon, cantaloupe or related melons, cucumbers, winter
or Japanese squash, cushaw, bitter melon, and other species of squash/pumpkin/gourd.

[56] Niche Construction: Implications for Archaeology
Niche construction is a relatively new theoretical idea in evolutionary biology, arguably
“extending” traditional evolutionary theory. Essentially, it emphasizes the role of the organism
in shaping the environment – in turn, generating novel evolutionary dynamics. Niche
construction is defined in a highly inclusive way from population-genetic models to cultural
niche construction in human evolution. We explore the concept of niche construction and its
logical place within archaeology to examine theoretical underpinnings and assumptions about
human evolution. We argue that niche construction is a useful concept bridging theoretical
disconnects between physical and cultural evolution in contemporary archaeological theory.

[99] Late Prehistoric Subsistence Economy on the Periphery of the Southern Plains
We examine subsistence remains from Late Prehistoric period components along the southern
Plains periphery. Archaeologists argue that a shift from generalized hunting and gathering to
big game hunting occurred during Toyah interval, the latter part of this period. Assessment of
subsistence remains using the diet-breadth model does not support the argument that diet-
breadth narrowed due to a focus on big game hunting. Instead, Late Prehistoric components
exhibit wide variation in subsistence remains, from very low-ranked plant foods to high-ranked
big game. The data are better explained by changes in mobility strategies in response to a
variable and risky environment.

declines in the size and numbers of reef piscivores and an increase in reef herbivores of a
lower trophic level. Principles of island biogeography applied to the zooarchaeological record
allow identification of human impact on island biotas.

[104] Historical Archaeology for the 21st Century - Revisiting Stanley South
A fresh look is taken at research methods in historical archaeology. In the 1970’s, Stanley
South’s “Method and Theory in Historical Archeology,” was a call to revitalize historical
archaeology. In this book, he called upon historical archaeologists to move beyond the goals
of preservation and restoration, and look at answering broader anthropological questions.
Decades have passed, and a review of archaeological literature shows that this is a perfect
time to revisit South’s ideas. Proposed archaeological work in Missouri and Kansas, focusing
on slave economies, can provide an example of the type of truly anthropological historical
archaeology proposed by Stanley South.

[184] Paleo-Coastal Archaeology and Peopling of the New World: The Problem of Clovis-First
and Land-Locked Models of Prehistory
Traditional archaeological thinking identifies Ice Age terrestrial hunters of the continental
interior, Paleo-Indians, as the root of prehistoric North America’s cultural diversity, including
Late Holocene maritime societies. Advances in Paleo-Coastal archaeology reveals the land-
locked flaws of this model, suggesting that endless debate about whether Clovis was the first
culture in North America obscures the colonization of coastal North America during the Late
Pleistocene by non-terrestrial hunters; namely, seaborne Paleo-Coastal groups. Increasingly,
it appears that two distinctive techno-economic traditions were responsible for the peopling of
the New World: Paleo-Coastal and Paleo-Indian.

some cases, even later. This paper will explore variation in lithic procurement and production

considered within broader economic and social contexts. Issues to be considered include
access to copper and good stone, economic networks, non-lithic craft production, subsistence

[60] The Spread of Shell-Tempering in the Mississippi Black Prairie
The earliest shell-tempered pottery in the Black Belt physiographic province of Mississippi
dates from ca. A.D. 1050- 1100. Later, sites producing shell-tempered pottery are common,
with assemblages dominated by sherds with plain surfaces, making dating based on
diagnostic artifacts difficult. Shell tempering rapidly superseded grog tempering, suggesting to
some researchers that abrupt population replacement had occurred. We argue that the spread
of Mississippian farmsteads over the province was gradual, accompanied by the spread of
shell tempering. Absolute and relative dating, combined with functional and environmental
analyses, help explain this pattern from an evolutionary perspective.

[201] Identity Crisis: The Archaeology of Indigenousness and Ethnicity in 21st Century
America
Since its inception, North American archaeology, a self-appointed caretaker of culture, has
continually, yet inconsistently, recast, reconstituted, and re-invented indigenous identity. Such
an approach has left archaeologists and Native Americans with fundamental incompatibilities
regarding interpretations of the past. Unfortunately, this incongruity has been conveyed and
emphasized in recent, imprudent statutory and regulatory language, interpretation, and
application, as well. In my paper, I will discuss this troublesome legacy of the “archaeology of
identity” and make the case that archaeology’s role as arbiter of indigenousness and ethnicity
should be abandoned due to its inherent methodological improbability, cultural
inappropriateness, and ultimate inconsequentiality.

prior simplicity and inevitable complexity, but ongoing and non-directional transformations in

Critiques of sociopolitical types over the past two decades have pointed out shortcomings in

[149] Postclassic Maya Ceramics at Colha: Petrographic and Type:variety Analyses
Petrographic and Type:variety analyses of Colha ceramics are used to investigate changes in
ceramic production technology and organization during the Postclassic. Postclassic sherds
from Colha are grouped by petrofabric, surface treatment, and modes. The groupings are then
compared to locally available raw materials. Changes in technological homogeneity,
production specialization, and origin will be examined and related to the general economy of
Postclassic Colha.

[17] Settlement Patterns under Changing Paleoenvironmental Conditions in Palpa on the
South Coast of Peru
In the valleys of Palpa we recently recorded more than 800 archaeological sites dating from
the Initial to the Inka period (1100 BC - AD 1532). Important shifts in population density and
settlement location occurred throughout this time period. Paleoecological investigations
undertaken in the framework of our interdisciplinary project revealed that climatic conditions
changed from a humid environment in the Formative Period to extreme aridity in the Late
Nasca Period, followed again by a humid period in the Late Intermediate Period. We suggest
that variable paleoenvironmental conditions were an important factor for cultural change on
the south coast of Peru.

[36] Coprolite Analysis in Mummy Studies
Coprolite data from mummies can be compared to corporal and artifact dietary data. Artifacts
buried within tombs show the variety of foods available to the culture. Stable isotopic data and
trace element data provides a general picture of what classes of foods were eaten. Such data
can show weaning age and diet difference between population subcomponents. Coprolite data
detail dietary reconstruction because residues can be identified to the genus and species
level. Coprolites also show details of food and drink preparation. This article summarizes data
sets from excavated Chiribaya mummies from the Osmore drainage of southern Peru.

[129] Reading the Trees: Dendrochronology in Northwestern Wyoming
Dendrochronology plays a vital role in the reconstruction of past regional climates, ecological
disturbance, and most importantly for archaeology, connecting tree-rings to past human
behavior. In 2006, CSU students collected samples for dendrochronological analysis from
living trees, anthropogenically modified wood, and four historic cabins. A few weeks later, the
study area, already devastated by beetle kill, burned and at least one of four cabins was
destroyed. Thus, the samples collected represent more than just a paleoecological proxy they
became the serendipitous yet, in retrospect, predictable final vestige of archaeological
features sampled in a montane landscape shaped by fire.

[165] Folsom Tool-Stone Use at the Martin Site, Estancia Basin, New Mexico
The Martin Folsom Site collections, recovered in the 1950s by William Roosa, were
reinvestigated to study the distribution of raw materials and technology used in the production
of stone tools. The analysis indicates very high rates of fluting and secondary fluting of
projectile points. Additional debitage analyses of flake morphology indicate that the Folsom
knapping was dominated by biface reduction. The majority of Martin Site raw material was
identified as Edwards Chert from central Texas, the nearest outcrop of which is over 500 km
from the site. Implications for land use and possible trade networks are explored.

[27] Tell Identification in the Northern Jordan Valley: Comparing Methods Using Multiple
Remotely-Sensed Data Sets
This study will examine the potential of two image analysis techniques used in site
identification in the northern Jordan Valley. CORONA imagery serves to identify tell locations
using tell dimension parameters. These are then used to identify additional sites using image
analysis algorithms. Using Landsat and ASTER, the spectral signature of a sample of known
sites is extracted to perform supervised classification and identify additional sites. The results
are then compared and validated using a database of known site locations. The degree of
spatial agreement between these two analyses will demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks
of each technique.

[4] Time Changes Everything: What the Darkmold Site Tells Us about Basketmaker
Subsistence in the Durango Area and Beyond
Faunal analysis can contribute to a better understanding of a fundamental issue that
archaeology can address: the shift from mobile hunter-gatherers to sedentary agriculturalists.
This zooarchaeological analysis focuses on the faunal remains from Pit Structure 2, a
prominent feature of the Darkmold Site, a Basketmaker II site near Durango, Colorado. Pit
Structure 2’s multiple cultural layers were very distinct, and the faunal remains can thus be
segregated into chronological groups. This will enhance our understanding of the varying
importance that hunting played as a society became more aggregated and turned to other,
domesticated sources of calories and protein.

[64] Late Prehistoric Subsistence Change at High Elevations in the White Mountains, Eastern
California: The Archaeobotanical Record
The existence of substantial late prehistoric residential occupation sites in the alpine zone of
the White Mountains, eastern California, is generally thought to represent a significant
intensification of regional subsistence strategies. The extent to which these ‘villages’ represent
a novel residential mode of alpine settlement and resource use, or alternatively is an extension
of earlier alpine land use practices, has been subject to question. The record of dietary plant
remains from a ‘village’ and ‘pre-village’ occupations provides insights into the nature and
pace of late prehistoric subsistence change in the White Mountains alpine zone.

[3] Villa El Salvador: An Early Intermediate Period Cemetery Used by Multiple Population
Groups, Evidence from Skeletal Indicators
In studying cemetery populations questions often remain concerning the number of groups
represented. Individual population variation is commonly based on the quantity and/or quality
of offerings. Such differences may be inappropriate if multiple populations used a cemetery.
Here skeletal indicators are used to examine the makeup of the Villa El Salvador (VES)
cemetery. Analysis of muscle markers from 60 individuals suggests VES was composed of
fishers and farmers. These results are supported by a study of cranial deformation, which
reveal distinct patterns for the fishers and farmers. These results create an interpretable
picture that broadens our understanding of VES populations.

[103] The Mirador Complex at El Perú-Waka’: History and Power Cached in Pyramids
The pyramids of the Mirador Complex memorialized Waka’s dynasty and were a space for the
deliberate presentation of the past to reinforce ruling power. Extremely public and visible
commemorative monuments, this locale was also privileged and physically inaccessible.
Material expressions of the distinguished pedigree and cosmopolitan connections of Waka'
royalty include an Olmec heirloom statuette in a royal tomb and a male stucco head
possessing Teotihuacáno elements. This paper examines the association of interments,
artifacts and sculpture discovered to date in this sacred built environment, and how the power
of the past is purposefully manipulated in the reproduction of legitimate authority.

[144] "The Very Embodiment of the Black Peasant"? Archaeology, History, and the Making of
the Serer of Siin (Senegal)
The Serer of Siin hold a special place in the ethnic imagination of Senegal – occupying one of
the ‘savage slots’ in narratives of national identification. Beginning in the colonial period, the
Serer have been constructed as the quintessential peasant population, culturally conservative
and rooted in immutable tradition. These ethnographic clichés have in turn been projected
onto the precolonial past, producing largely static portrayals of historical and cultural
experiences in the region. Recent archaeological and ethnohistorical research, however, paint
a more ambiguous picture, shedding nuanced light on the depth and nature of processes of
social construction in Siin.

Dynamics at Late Classic Copán, Honduras (AD 750-820)
This paper examines changing social dynamics across two dynastic regimes at Late Classic
(AD750-820) Copán, Honduras, just prior to the Maya “collapse”. A Geographic Information
System was employed to measure changes in access and visibility in order to investigate how
the built environment was used to reinforce or actively shift social relationships among
Copán’s inhabitants. The results indicate that the built environment was used to control
access, manipulate the flow of movement, and influence visual perception and as such,
formed part of an indigenous Maya strategy to shape social dynamics in an attempt to curb
sociopolitical pressures and avoid “collapse”.

purchased by the Catholic Church and consecrated November 2, 1857. The first interments at
Calvary were the remains of persons removed from the "Old Cemetery." Recovery of 26
individuals reveals that not all burials were removed to the new location. This paper provides
preliminary results of excavation and analysis of the excavated burials.

[18] Huastec Sculpture and the Cult of the Feathered Serpent
Following Teotihuacan’s collapse, new ceremonial centers dedicated to the cult of the
Feathered Serpent emerged and united to fill the power vacuum during the Epiclassic and
Early Postclassic periods. While previous scholars do not include the Huasteca in this
federation, I suggest that prominent Huastec sites participated in the cult network and
produced sculptures inscribed with a complex of symbols related to the Feathered Serpent cult
to demonstrate their membership. This study has implications for research on artistic
interaction within Mesoamerica and beyond, positing the Huasteca as another possible venue
through which cosmological concepts involving the Feathered Serpent wind god were
distributed.

domestic dogs on California’s Channel Islands. Dogs were present on the islands for much of
the Holocene and are the only animals unequivocally introduced by humans prehistorically.
Our analysis suggests that dogs would have significantly impacted native animals, especially
breeding birds, sea mammals, and foxes, and demonstrates the indirect impacts that people
had on island ecosystems.

[110] Archaeological Evidence of Niche Construction from the Middle-Upper Paleolithic
Transition and the Paleoindian Settlement of the Americas
Niche construction refers to the evolutionary process whereby an organism modifies its
environment to make it more suitable for its subsequent success. Recently, niche construction
has stimulated debate in anthropological theory, but it has yet to impact archaeological theory.
Using the Middle-Upper Paleolithic transition in Europe and the Paleoindian settlement of the
Americas as case studies, we show that archaeological data are uniquely suited to document
incidences of prehistoric human niche construction. We conclude that niche construction is a
process germane to the human career and therefore needs to be given due consideration in
contemporary archaeological research.

The Colonial “lienzos” from the Coixtlahuaca Basin of Oaxaca refer to archaeological sites
providing clues as to how local inhabitants, at the time of the Spanish Conquest,
conceptualized their past and appropriated the ancient cultural landscape for purposes of
promoting claims to land in territorial disputes. Although conceived to bolster 16th century
territorial claims, most of accounts begin ca. A.D. 800, a time period that is still virtually
unknown archaeologically, both locally and regionally. This paper addresses questions about
cultural continuity between periods, migration, religion, statecraft, Coixtlahuaca’s interactions
with other regions of Mesoamerica, and intra and inter-regional warfare and conquest.

Understanding political hierarchy and settlement rank is particularly acute in the Bolonchen
District of the Puuc Hills, where standard criteria often seem contradictory. This paper
examines Huntichmul, Yucatan, with respect to settlement size and density, household
composition, monuments, public architecture, and artifact assemblages. During 2006 three
new stelae were recovered, test excavations were conducted at several loci, and the densely
populated northern half of the site was partially mapped. These data suggest communities
varied significantly within the area, and that standard measures such as palace size may be
misleading. Data also show a late occupation horizon not yet encountered elsewhere in the
region.

In areas without a direct historical approach to the past, the concept of tradition has been

tradition as a unit of culture in narratives of long-term change. When tradition is theorised
within a model of historical practice, traditions have cumulative emergent properties distinct
from the individual actions making them up which structure their long-term development. As an
illustration, traditions of representing the human body through later European prehistory

[86] Space and Sensitivity: Detecting Cultural Landscape Impacts in the Transition to Neolithic
Agriculture in Southwest Asia
On-site archaeological evidence has shown how people transformed selected plants and
animals from “wild” to domestic during the Epipalaeolithic and Neolithic in Southwest Asia. But
while agriculture led to the modification of natural environments, off-site evidence for early
agricultural impacts on the East Mediterranean landscape has remained elusive. Here we
describe how multiple proxy data (pollen, stable isotopes, charcoal, phytoliths) from parallel
lake sediment and archaeological sequences can be used to fingerprint different human and
natural agencies. In central Anatolia, this suggests that the impact of Neolithic farming
societies was spatially extensive as well as locally intensive.

ancient images that appear naturalistic but are actually foreign symbolic conventions. By
exploring the visual culture of archaeology this paper will show how modern assumptions may
be affecting our interpretation of past images.

Chaco Canyon was a central gathering place for Ancestral Puebloans in northwest New

Shrines on high places may have facilitated practical communication, and they may have
marked landforms that held special significance. We are investigating this phenomenon using

[74] Raw Material Provenance of Olmec Serpentinites from La Merced: Isotopic and
Geochemical Constraints
Serpentinites (SAO) a common Olmec material. At La Merced site (1200-900 B.C.) found
more than one ton of SAO and their geological provenance was determined with use of
petrography, X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, inductively coupled plasma mass, electron
microprobe, and thermal ionization mass spectrometry (Rb-Sr and Sm-Nd isotopic systems)
on 17 SAO and 15 geological serpentinites (GS) from Tehuitzingo-Acatlán, Sierra de Juárez-

[183] Early Villages or Palimpsest Farmsteads? Chronological Analysis of the Dunlap-Salazar
Pithouse Site, Lincoln County, New Mexico
The development of village communities in the archaeological record is generally identified
through the appearance of clusters of dwellings within relatively compact areas. However,
without precise intrasite chronological data, it is difficult to distinguish repeated multi-year
reoccupation of a location by small social groups from an occupation by a larger true “village”
community. As a case study, I examine stratigraphic and high precision radiocarbon data from
a portion of the Dunlap-Salazar site, a 6th-9th century pithouse “village” site in southeastern
New Mexico. I find that the “village” site might be accounted for by repeated reoccupation by
small (less-than-village) social groups.

[107] Jade in Full: Domestic, Attached, and Elite Prestige Goods Production in the Middle
Motagua Valley, Guatemala
Objects crafted from jadeite were highly valued prestige goods and played a vital part in the
political economies of all prehispanic Mesoamerican civilizations. Despite their importance, we
know little about how their production was organized. Recent excavation and surface survey
data from the Middle Motagua Valley, Guatemala are used to address the role of domestic
craftspersons in the production and distribution of jadeite prestige goods. This paper
demonstrates that simple typological models are insufficient to describe (and may hinder) our
ability to understand the role of domestic craft production in the prehispanic political
economies.

features has recently been identified in western Riverside County in outcroppings of the
Cretaceous-aged Arroyo el Toro graniodiorite. This paper reviews the weathering properties of
the host rock, distribution of rocks of this type in relation to the distribution of known yonis, and

significant stratification of household groups even in this rural hamlet during the Terminal

Early Postclassic, coinciding with the decay of long-distance trade, regional demographic
decline, and a leveling of hierarchical social structures.

[212] Gender Ideology and Differential Development of Mississippian Societies
Archaeological evidence of mortuary practices demonstrates very different gender ideologies
in South Appalachian Mississippian societies than in late prehistoric societies elsewhere in the
southeastern United States. We consider the possibility that tension between kin-group and
village-level leadership, on the one hand, and attempts to assert regional hegemony, on the
other, affected the social and political organization of these societies. We conclude that this
tension, and the different ways in which it was resolved in different places, and at different
times, contributed to significant variation in the nature of Mississippian societies.

[104] New and Improved Blades and Knives: Narratives of Colonialism and Technological
Change
When the Spanish conquered Mexico in 1521, they brought with them tools and technologies
that were unknown in Mesoamerica, including steel blades and knives, among others. Given
our assumptions of technological progress and practicality, we would think that indigenous
people would begin using steel blades soon after the conquest. However, archaeological
patterns in Xaltocan, Mexico, show exactly the opposite trend: chipped stone tool production
was re-taken and intensified after the Spanish conquest, while steel knives were largely
ignored. I argue that this trend was related to control over the means of production rather than
by European notions of practicality.

[127] Fire and Socioecological Systems in East-Central Arizona
Fire is a keystone ecological process that has been transformed into a mechanism for
ecological and social catastrophe in the modern American West. Prior to fire suppression,
however, fire was a critical interface between social and ecological systems. Six stratigraphic
sequences from alluvial channel fans disclose variability in particle size, soil phosphorous,
carbon isotopes, sedimentary charcoal, and pollen assemblages that indicate variability in fire
regimes since AD 1100. Over this period, human behavior and natural communities interacted
as genuine socioecological systems that were resilient to climatic perturbations, such as
multiyear droughts that instigate catastrophic fire events in the contemporary Southwest.

[163] Mobile Farmers of the Western Central Plains: Upper Republican Ceramic Variability
and Its Implications
The people of the Upper Republican of the western Central Plains have long been known as
village-dwelling farmers, while contemporaneous High Plains sites with stylistically comparable
assemblages have been regarded as representing seasonal hunting by these "villagers." New
work in both areas is suggesting instead that a single population appeared at various times as
settled farmers and as mobile hunters. The ceramics are a key line of evidence. The pottery is
broadly similar across the region, but a detailed microstyle analysis shows considerable
heterogeneity within localities. This contrasts markedly with style distributions in
contemporaneous sedentary communities to the east.

a Classic period agricultural village located in the northern Tucson Basin, explores the nature
of changes in residential, economic, and social organization. The Yuma Wash site was
occupied throughout the Classic period, allowing for a unique perspective on household
change. Although intensive occupation at the site has made identifying chronological
sequences challenging, preliminary results of analyses reveal distinct forms of household
organization and village settlement patterns through time.

[86] The Ecological Footprint of Early Levantine Cereal Exploitation
Investigations of plant-use economies associated with early Levantine agriculture usually seek
evidence from on-site archaeobotanical remains. However, there is a natural bias to these
records. The cultural filter does not allow either a picture of what plants were available in the
site vicinity, or how plant exploitation in Natufian and Neolithic societies impacted the natural
environment during the Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition. Analyses of phytoliths
from a Hula Lake core in comparison with the Natufian site of Ein Mallaha on the nearby shore
give a fuller picture of how plant-use economies impacted the environment among cereal-
exploiting hunter-gatherers.

claimed to be diagnostic of cereal threshing, as opposed to reaping, appear on artifacts which
can only be interpreted as sickle segments, suggesting that these features are less diagnostic

[127] Conflict, Climate, and Culture during the Late Moloko in South Africa
One of the most striking developments of the Late Iron Age in northwestern South Africa
during the late Moloko phase (ca. 1700-1830 CE) was a significant shift in the settlement
patterns of BaTswana agropastoralists, from small, dispersed village homesteads into large
towns with populations in the thousands. This was a result of a complex interplay between
catastrophic historical and environmental events including colonial encroachment and drought.
Oral-historical records describe an intensification of inter-lineage conflict and competition over
scarce natural resources. These records contextualize the archaeological evidence for
changes in spatial organization, labor specialization, ceramic and metal production, and
gender relations.

[7] Regional Perspective on the Earliest Olmec: Cherla Phase (1350-1200 BC) Interaction
Documented at Cuauhtémoc, Soconusco, Mexico
We offer no new polemic on the Olmec. Instead, new evidence is presented from the small
site of Cuauhtémoc. Changes in color and size of ceramics during the Cherla phase indicate
that black and white vessels formed the largest class of serving dishes. Sourcing results
indicate that the majority of these dishes were local, but a finely made variety was imported.
Obsidian was more reduced during the Cherla phase and there was an increased use of high
quality obsidian. Together these data indicates a significant reorganization at Cuauhtémoc
during the very beginning of the late Early Formative circa 1350 BC.

exhibit ancient morphologies from great contexts but produced modern A.M.S. dates in the

materials have now produced ancient dates that at last confirm the Nanchoc materials as early
cultigens. The story of the long controversy surrounding these plant materials is instructive of
how archaeological information is constructed, critiqued, and transferred to textbooks.

analyses on a single pictograph have been done to verify methods worldwide. In those
comparisons, agreement was less than satisfactory.

by a change from subsistence level agriculture production to an orientation centered on
interaction and exchange of corn and ceramics into the heart of the Chaco territory.

[32] Built to Order: Reconstructing Measurement Systems Using Extant Architecture from
Paquimé, Chihuahua
Standards of measure are typically associated with state-level societies, but the planned
architectural construction of Paquimé and Chaco in the North American Southwest certainly
hints at the existence of standard measurement systems. This possibility hasn’t been
evaluated in large part because archaeologists have no established method for reproducing
such measurement systems. Such a method is presented and then applied to the architectural
remains of Paquimé to determine if a standard unit of measure was used. The presence or
absence of such a system will tell archaeologists about the interaction between
standardization, specialization and architecture in middle-range societies.

Digital mapping can add valuable information to the interpretation of a site. For example,

However, a neighboring protohistoric pueblo was built abiding the construction layout provided
in the creation story. These results indicate that perhaps the San Lazaro Pueblo was built
before the origin of the creation story. Digital mapping provided information about architectural
construction methods; radiocarbon data confirmed these hypotheses.

Conventional wisdom holds that Late Stone Age (LSA) ceramics in South Africa coincide with
the arrival of Iron Age agropastoralism from the north. But direct radiocarbon dates on fiber
temper in LSA sherds (ca 200 BC cal) show that undecorated bowls were being made
centuries before the first Iron Age arrivals. Reliably dated Iron Age ceramics of comparable
age occur over 1500 kilometers to the north. This scenario has striking parallels with the much
earlier emergence of hunter-gatherer ceramics around the Sea of Japan, and in the American
Southeast. Such striking convergence across continents and time suggests common trigger(s)
for hunter-forager:pot-making.

[70] Investigations at Cerro de la Máscara Site, El Fuerte, Sinaloa
Rock art sites are ubiquitous throughout the state of Sinaloa, and unquestionably represent
the prevalent archaeological component recognized within the region. Among these, the Cerro
de la M·scara site, containing estimated 700-800 individual glyphs, is perhaps the most widely
known site. The Proyecto Cerro de la M·scara was initiated in anticipation of opening this site
to the public, and constitutes the first systematic investigation of a rock art within Sinaloa. This
project involves systematic survey and location of all the features, controlled surface
collections, excavation of select features and test units, and the creation of a catalogue of the
petroglyphs.

[77] Middle Bronze Age Pottery Production in the Upper Tigris River Valley: A view from
Kenan Tepe
In 2002, UTARP members discovered a melted mud brick pyrotechnic facility in the Middle
Bronze Age levels. Research indicates it burned to 1100 degrees Celsius. This paper argues
that the remains excavated were the firebox of a two stage kiln, and that the remains
constitute an in-situ production facility for figurines and vessels of the Middle Bronze Age
assemblage, known as Red Brown Wash Ware. This paper presents a current picture of this
pottery’s production in the Upper Tigris region, situates Kenan Tepe’s pottery corpus in that
regional frame, and addresses the anomalous high temperatures achieved in this kiln's
firebox.

[184] Terminal Pleistocene Settlement of the West Coast of South America
The last decade has seen a major reassessment of the initial occupation of the Pacific Coast
of South America. We now know that maritime-adapted peoples were present in the region by
at least 13,000 cal yr BP, employing a variety of technologies to target specific taxa of marine
organisms, constructing dwellings, and establishing logistical and base camps. Despite
enthusiasm over these finds, however, there is much that we do not yet know, beginning with
migration route(s). This paper briefly synthesizes current knowledge, discusses gaps in our
understanding of early coastal settlement, and suggests strategies for addressing these gaps.

[209] Lithic Raw Material Utilisation in Central Honshu during the Terminal Pleistocene
This study focuses on the analysis of acquisition practices and reduction sequences of lithic
raw materials during the terminal Pleistocene in Central Honshu. During this time, which
coincided temporally with the emergence of pottery, the size of the raw material acquisition
territories was reduced and rational and economical reduction sequences were changed into
expedient and wasteful reduction sequences. The association of this transformed lithic raw
material utilisation with the use of pottery provides an opportunity to explore strategies based
on reduced mobility.

[5] Ancient Roadways and Modern Technology: Mapping Maya Causeway Systems Through
Satellite Imagery Manipulation
In the past, archaeological analyses of Maya causeways were limited to those in direct
proximity to site centers; little attention was paid to inter-site roads, or the system as a whole.
It is important to realize that roads should be examined as a system rather than in isolation as
they are tangible evidence of types of interactions between sites. To comprehensively
understand the interactions across the Maya region, all roads must be identified. This project
discusses the process and results of roadway mapping in Peten, Guatemala, and surrounding
regions by means of advancing techniques in satellite imagery manipulation.

When studying the first cultures and peoples of South America, archeologists have focused

those in both North America and South America. This paper addresses the polemics and
understandings of these issues, particularly with reference to the misunderstanding that most

[58] The Alterity of Complexity and the Illusion of Change
Self-aware organisms have other-awareness and with it the cognitive basis for social
differentiation. The cosmologies of peoples worldwide evoke the root metaphors of alterity,
while origins myths supply the temporality for ranking difference. As institutionalized forms of
inequality, so-called “complex” societies are arguably the consolidation, spatially and socially,
of regionally dispersed but historically intertwined social formations. Thus, complexity, as
usually conceived, does not “emerge” or “evolve” as a unique human condition, but rather is a
particularly familiar manifestation of the process of imposing structure through practices of
inclusion and exclusion. Case material from the American Southeast illustrates these
concepts.

Archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence from pre- and post-contact contexts reflect

Apalachee, both elite and commoners, acted in ways that reflected traditional practices,
culturally-based personal motivations, and growing understandings of Spanish goals and

sites in Guatemala, including Piedras Negras, Tikal, Kaminaljuyu, and the Pasíon region and
compare our findings to data on dental wear from other archaeological populations from
around the world. Contrary to common belief, Maya dental wear was relatively minimal, likely a
result of extensive food processing and the use of soft limestone as grinding stones.

Mediterranean Spain’s archaeological record is well-suited to increase our understanding of
human responses to global climate change. However, sea level rises during the Pleistocene-
Holocene transition inundated the Mediterranean littoral and submerged its hunter-gatherer
record of coastal landuse. Research in southern Scandia, where isostatic rebound kept pace
with post-glacial sea levels, suggests that shorelines were components of an overall, annual
subsistence pattern exploiting both interior and coastal resources. Applying remote sensing
techniques first developed to locate submerged archaeological evidence in the Gulf of Mexico
potentially opens an important new area of research in the Western Mediterranean that is

South Africa's Ndzundza Ndebele are well known for their bright murals and women's
paraphernalia and are perceived as an homogenous ethnic group. Archaeological material
culture from Steelpoort River sites, dating between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries,
contradict the projected homogeneity: Royal settlement pattern and middens expressed
‘Ndebeleness’, whilst houses and ceramic style invoke ‘Pediness’. These different identities
were products of the articulation of specific social and gender relations within the regional
context. These disparities emphasise the complex, and sometimes contradictory, identities
articulated within African communities, and highlight the perilousness of past southern African
Iron Age approaches, which abstracted group identity.

[169] Attention in the Field: Using Vigilance Theory to Improve the Consistency of Pedestrian
Survey Data Collection
Since the advent of off-site regional survey, the primary function of pedestrian survey teams
has been to walk the landscape in search of artifacts. Empirical studies have shown that
artifact recovery rates vary from person to person, and can fluctuate over the course of a day,
season, and entire project. Such variable recovery compromises the validity of survey results.
This paper applies vigilance research (initially undertaken by the military to monitor attention
decrements in radar operators) to the question of archaeological survey team performance.
Results suggest that while fieldwalker inconsistency cannot be eliminated, certain
methodological practices can mitigate its effects.

employed the same strategies in the Lower Motagua Valley. Instead, there is little evidence of
architectural emulation in the remarkably uniform closed quadrangle sites that characterize
Lower Motagua Valley settlements, with integration occurring through an economy based on
portable material culture, particularly ceramics. An examination of the Morja Site illustrates this
point.

dissertation, the question of a Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition was limited to simple
acceptance or rejection. My acceptance rested partly but incorrectly on the presence of Middle
and Upper Paleolithic industries found in the same layer. Fortunately, it was preceded by a
long series of blade-rich industries upon which this paper is based. Our knowledge of lithic
production techniques, regional chronologies plus the publication of additional sites have
contributed enormously to our understanding of the issue. This paper offers a reinterpretation
of the lithic sequence at Jerf al-Ajla based on these contributions especially those of Tony
Marks.

[40] Sifting Through INFRA: Balancing Forest Service Data Management Goals with
Practicality
Balancing current heritage program needs with future data management goals is a growing
responsibility of Forest Service Heritage Specialists (Archaeologists). Although heritage data
management practices within the Forest Service are currently decided at the Ranger District
and Forest level, a soon to be mandatory national database, INFRA, is becoming established.
INFRA has developed into one of several mobile spatial database tools that can enable more
efficient methods of data collection, processing, and storage. Every Forest could benefit from
a cost benefit analysis to explore the immediate and long-term value of choosing to adopt
many of the options associated with INFRA.

[117] Modeling Holocene Landscape History and Climate Change in the Indus: Environmental
Perspectives on Human Geography
Landscape models for Harappan emergence, florescence, and decline are based on
correlated settlement data and speculative terrain reconstructions. These data are aberrant,
structured on surface settlement and inferred landscape relations. The Beas River study
produced stratified, dated Holocene sequences linking buried soils, and alluvial histories
encompassing the Harappan occupation. An innovative climatic paradigm models structures
Holocene circulation trends based on high resolution stream discharge and precipitation data.
Time transgressive climate phases coincide with periods of landscape stability and dynamism.
A critical break co-incident with Harappan emergence (5500 B.P.) was the initiation of uniform,
less seasonal precipitation that invariably affected Harappan settlement geography.

Fort Drum uses sensitivity models to target inventory survey. Judgmental testing, based on

new upland model was developed through GIS utilizing multiple physical attributes such as
slope and portage and terrace locations. Using these attributes in conjunction with navigable
waterways has potentially identified new areas to investigate for prehistoric occupation that
were decidedly different from those tested before and included terraces that were not closely
associated with waterways. The results of the first set of tests show great potential and have
yielded new sites.

This paper examines the occurrence of Ancient Maya multiple burials in the central lowland
region of west-central Belize. Only recently have Maya scholars focused their attention on the
presence and interpretation of interments that contain numerous individuals. This paper
considers the prevalence of multiple-person burials in the western Belize region, and posits an
interpretation of these mortuary events related to cyclical periods of increased political and
socioeconomic de-stabilization. To withstand these particular times of crisis, it is proposed that
specific groups incorporated ritual strategies that served to strengthen group solidarity.

[202] Identifying the Underworld: Tracing Excavated Speleothems from Maya Sites to their
Caves of Origin
There is little doubt that caves were important ritual venues for the ancient Maya. Despite
years of cave research, archaeologists do not know which sites were using particular caves.
Speleothems from caves have been excavated at surface sites in western Belize. This
suggests a method of linking the surface site to its cave of origin using chemical signatures.
To model geographic aspects of ancient Maya cave use, the Belize Valley Speleothem Project
collected speleothem samples from caves and surface contexts for analyses. We use ICP/MS
and INAA analyses to obtain chemical fingerprints of possible source caves. Here we present
preliminary results.

compare the variation seen in Magdalenian spearthrowers with that present in a sample taken
from ethnographically known hunter-gatherer groups. In the end, I interpret some of the

gender, of the spearthrowers’ owners.

Mesoamerican cave archaeology emerged as a self-conscious subdiscipline out of a session

session ever held, the Nashville meeting’s size and extensive organization gave it a singular
historical importance because the majority of cave researchers coalesced as a group at this

the session that are still functioning as integrative mechanisms. The impact of the session on
the trajectory of the field’s development is assessed in light of events during the last decade.

[115] One Identity in Death: On the Interpretation of Mortuary Similarity
Mortuary analysis typically investigates past social identities by examining differences among
burials. However, in choosing to emphasize mortuary variability, we often fail to consider the
significance of similarity. For example, in early medieval Ireland (c. AD 400-1200), adherence
to standard Christian mortuary practice resulted in markedly similar burials. I contend that for
the early Irish, it is this conformity that was meaningful. All burials are essentially the same
because the only aspect of social identity that mattered in death was one’s Christianity.
Consequently, this case study highlights the importance of aspects of identity (e.g. religion)
often neglected in archaeological research.

[181] Character, Global Context and Causes of North American Medieval Megadroughts
Annual resolution, gridded, tree ring data show that several droughts of Dust Bowl severity,
and similar spatial extent, lasted for decades at a time during the Medieval period. The
thirteenth century depopulation in the Southwest occurred during one of these great droughts,
unremarkable from the perspective of the prior few centuries, but following several relatively
wet decades. The megadroughts fitted into a distinct global Medieval hydroclimate regime.
Climate models are used to argue that a persistent La Nina-like state in the tropical Pacific and
a stronger thermohaline circulation, both induced by strong radiative forcing, are plausible
states that best explain Medieval hydroclimate.

[215] Archaeology, Information, Eligibility, and Significance
Eligibility to the National Register of Historic Places is a central concept in cultural resource
management. It determines which historic places get considered in Federal agency planning
and which don’t. This works out reasonably well for the built environment; it doesn’t work well
at all for archaeology. The eligibility standard applied to most archaeological sites—that they
have to be able to yield “important” information about the past—is incompatible with both the
nature of the archaeological record and the temporal dimension of archaeological research.
The result is decisions that are both bad archaeology and bad public policy.

[73] Caches, De Facto Refuse and Plain Old Discard: The Case of Jupiter Rockshelter
Jupiter, a small rockshelter in western Presidio County, Texas, contained a deposit posing
several interpretive questions. A small lithic assemblage including an apparent predominance
of scraping tools, all overlain by a possible cache marker, was recovered during recent
excavation. Interassemblage and comparative analyses of the deposit, however, show that
Jupiter most likely did not contain what could easily have been interpreted as a cache. A
consideration of caching and discard behaviors, and the archaeological signatures of each,
suggest the label “cache” is often too simply applied to assemblages that may be, in actuality,
representative of behaviors other than caching.

While the index is a valid calculation, its cultural and biological interpretation is problematic.
Southwestern archaeologists have typically viewed changes in prehistoric leporid abundance

on inaccurate perceptions of leporid behavior. As the Lagomorph Index and notions of leporid
behavior are frequently analyzed together, resulting interpretations are problematic.

Ancient Costa Ricans exhibited extraordinary persistence in landscape use, in spite of
repeated volcanic eruptions. For instance, the Cañales village was struck by five explosive
eruptions during Arenal-Silencio phases, and was re-occupied after each. The re-occupiers
evidently were the direct descendants of the villagers who had to evacuate, because
reoccupants used the same path to their distant cemetery. Without the path-cemetery
evidence, one could argue they were merely culturally related and by coincidence re-
establishing a village at the same convenient location. These people created and perpetuated
their landscape social memory by repeated regional rituals of spiritual maintenance.

raised fields eventually graded into investigations of river and wetland management. Also,
since ancient field patterning was most often found in pastures, both could be taken as
indicators of whole landscapes, raising questions regarding relationships. Some of these
became apparent, for example, in comparisons of ancient and contemporary siting vis-à-vis
seasonal flooding. Superimposed cultural landscapes evoked landscape succession, a
concept derived from ecology and found useful for the analysis and representation of
environmental history.

[81] Marking the Grade: Graduate Students as Future Professors
Along with developing research skills most graduate students also face the challenge of
learning how to be effective teachers. Furthermore, employment as a teaching assistant or
associate instructor in undergraduate courses provides the primary source of funding for
graduate students at many universities. We outline several issues facing the graduate student
instructor including basic preparation for teaching and classroom dynamics, and explore the
extent to which pedagogical training can address these issues. We also look at the availability
of pedagogical training across a selection of archaeology graduate programs and outline some
best practices.

[57] Analysis of Ancient Maya Wooden Architecture Located on the Sea Floor at the John
Spang Site, Belize
This paper presents the results from investigations undertaken in 2006 of wooden posts
preserved at the John Spang Site, in Paynes Creek National Park, Belize, Central America.
Organic artifacts at terrestrial sites in the tropics usually have poor preservation. The wooden
posts preserved at the John Spang site are due to the site’s location in a peat bog below the
sea floor. The mapping and spatial analysis of these wooden posts reveal evidence of
structures associated with salt production along the coast of southern Belize produced for the
Late Classic Maya.

[42] Lessons Learned from the Construction of a Statewide Geophysics Program in California
In an effort to incorporate new efficient means of measuring sub-surface archaeological
deposits, the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) initiated a program for
integrating geophysical methods into field studies as part of its mitigation process. This
program has led to significant success in its goal but has also encountered a number of
unforeseen issues. A series of case studies generated from the history of the program provide
a useful outline of the misconceptions and practical solutions that occurred during the
program's first six years.

[138] Transportation Modes and Routes Throughout the Lower Colorado River Basin
Prehistoric trails, sites along those trails, and ethnographic reports indicate a large diversity in
transportation routes, and, in some cases, modes, within the lower Colorado River Drainage
Basin. They suggest alterations in trade priorities, destinations, and inter-group relationships
over time. With these alterations came influences in travel modes, both on rivers and overland.
In turn, these changes altered routes and cultural influences. The combined evidence
suggests that travel modes and routes both result from and influence cultures and
environment.

[14] The Great Earthwork of Tikal: The Hydraulic Hypothesis
The Great Earthwork of Tikal has been universally accepted as a manifestation of territorial
demarcation and military necessity. Research by the Estudio de Las Fortelezas de Tikal,
however, demonstrates that the established concept of the earthworks as parallel walls
protecting the hinterland of Tikal is wrong. Here, a model is proposed that interprets the
northern earthwork as a karst hydraulic construction used to mitigate seasonal fluctuations in
precipitation. This model postulates the primary function of the earthwork as a trench cut into
the phreatic zone with the purpose of collecting and distributing water to agricultural areas.

[154] Prehistoric Ceremonial Use of Caves in Southeastern North America
Ever since elaborate cave burials were discovered in a Tennessee cave in 1810, we have
recognized the prehistoric use of deep Southeastern caves for ceremonial purposes.
Beginning over 4000 years ago, people penetrated into deep karsts in the Appalachian
Plateau, exploring the underworld, burying the dead, mining a variety of minerals and raw
materials, and decorating cave walls and ceilings with cave art. Evidence suggests that all of
these activities were embedded in complex ceremonial processes some of which were specific
to the cave environment. Clearly, prehistoric concepts about the underworld and its role in
human lives informed these activities.

opportunity to expand my expertise by conducting research on several more substantial
Neolithic sites. In addition, I have broadened our view to include the Mediterranean island of
Cyprus, where we now know that the Neolithic was as early as it was on the mainland. Much
of this I attribute to Tony's influence and guidance.

Dynasty of India
The Qutb Shahi Dynasty (AD 1518–1687) controlled a territory in the Indian Deccan, within
which the elite population, predominantly of Persian and North Indian origin, expressed
themselves architecturally through a distinctive monument style. An analysis of such
monuments within the settlements of this territory reveals that this style is overwhelmingly
abundant in the capital, but extremely rare beyond it. The implications for understanding the
organization of the dynasty's administration and general relationship to its territory will be
discussed, as well as the implications for the more general study of complex societies through
monumental architecture.

A series of survey techniques were developed for improving interpretations of geophysical
data collected from rockshelters at Fort Hood, Texas. Resistance and magnetometer surveys
were completed using a dense vertical and horizontal survey scheme. These denser sampling
techniques were incorporated into the investigations of Barkley Plantation in Kentucky, with

which subsequent archaeological excavations were driven. The methodologies employed,

[17] The Inside of the Compound: Late Prehispanic Domestic Organization at Huayuri
Little research has been conducted into Prehispanic Andean household and supra-household
organization. The tacit equation of any large residential groupings with ayllus has stifled the
investigation of larger co-residential units such as compounds or clusters and their broader
socioeconomic implications. This paper explores domestic organization inside such a
residential cluster at Huayuri, a highly agglutinated, Late Prehispanic settlement in the
northern Nasca Drainage. Possible domestic units inside the cluster are delineated through
spatial and architectural analysis. From the associated tool assemblages, I infer the range of
each household unit’s economic activities and the nature of the ties between constituent
households.

prominent Native Hawaiian families and one of the corporate heavyweights in the archipelago,

[163] Why Pottery? A Perspective from the Upper Great Lakes
Native peoples of the Upper Great Lakes near Lake Superior were mobile hunter-gatherers
throughout prehistory. Maize cultivation did occur in the southern region but horticulture played
a small role in their subsistence. Because pottery, the hallmark of the Eastern Woodland
Period, does not appear until relatively late, the Woodland chronology of this area is divided
into two periods: Initial (A.D. 0–600) and Terminal (600–1600). Using a combination of use-
alteration traces and a performance-based approach, the following questions are addressed:
Why did pottery arrive so late, and why did people start making pottery at all?

[33] Site Visibility along the Lower Colorado River
The lower Colorado River has few Native American habitation sites identified within its
corridor. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric data suggest a significant prehistoric population was
in-place; however, archaeological evidence of these people is often limited to upland settings
where habitations were sparse. This poster explores natural and cultural processes to explain
the limited site evidence and presents the recent discoveries of buried sites along the river.
These data indicate that the lower Colorado River was a paramount area of population and
cultural growth whose archaeological importance has been diminished due to the limited
resolution of material culture.

The Rosaliya site is a small, single-component prehistoric site located on a large terrace
overlooking the Killik River. 2005 and 2006 excavations yielded flakes, microblades, core
shaping and rejuvenation flakes, burin spalls, wedge-shaped microblade cores, an abrader,
and large lanceolate projectile points. Site activities included the discard of used microblades
and bifacial tools, production of microblades, and the replacement of microblade insets in
composite tools. The assemblage has been dated to around 5120+/-40 BP. This small, briefly
occupied site clearly demonstrates the co-existence of microblade and bifacial technologies
during what is usually referred to as the late Northern Archaic period.

lifecycles of extensive rework and use. While retooling was the primary task at Gault, six
discarded bifaces retained traces of wear indicative of campsite expedient tasks.

Inscriptions from Anyang are dominated by divination records, but also include short
dedicatory texts on prestige goods. The appearance of personal and geographic names in
both categories of inscription, and a degree of overlap in writings for personal and geographic
names, have inspired attempts to match individuals and their activities with specific regions.
Methodological difficulties are considerable, however, and geographic precision remains
elusive. Inscriptional data are better suited to answering questions about the kinds and
quantities of prestige goods that were exchanged between Anyang and regional elites. The
new Huayuanzhuang Dongdi corpus provides a particularly rich snapshot of elite gift-giving.

Ethnographic data suggest that as hunter-gatherer populations increase, diets often expand to
include high handling cost foods. In this poster, we use this knowledge, in combination with
the prey model of foraging theory to predict trends in seed use during the Holocene in the
Wyoming Basin. We predict that in the marginal environment of the Wyoming Basin, evidence
for increasing use of low ranked plant foods such as seeds relative to higher ranked items
such as tubers should co-vary with evidence of rising human population densities. Our
analysis of over 280 dated components spanning almost 10,000 years supports this
prediction.

The northern Maya lowland site of Kulubá shares many close stylistic affiliations with the much
larger and distant site of Chichén Itzá. In contrast, analyses of settlement and ceramic data
collected during a survey within the Kulubá polity indicate that smaller sites in the vicinity do
not exhibit strong affinities with Chichén Itzá. It appears that Chichén’s connection with the
Kulubá polity was limited to the capital of Kulubá itself and not its lower-order settlements. This
study supports models that suggest Maya polities were maintained through elite-level
interaction between large centers rather than through programs of territorial consolidation.

[145] Agriculture in the Karst Valleys of Dalmatia: Sustainability throughout the Holocene
The spatial heterogeneity of soil characteristics (particularly thickness and permeability) in
karst valleys such as those of central Dalmatia would provide challenges for agricultural
management which varied with prevailing climate and land-use conditions. The sustainability
of any given practice would have varied spatially and temporally. Hill-slope erosion would have
been of concern in this region throughout the Holocene, as evidenced by the frequency of
coarse-grained sedimentation events. Different orientations of modern and Holocene field-
walls may indicate significant changes in the nature of sediment transport in the vicinity of the
Pokrovnik site between Neolithic times and the present.

[158] Correspondence Analysis: A Method for Monitoring Branching and Convergence in the
Archaeological Record
Frequency seriation has been hailed as the archaeological method for inferring heritable
continuity among artifact assemblages. Yet, frequency seriation allows us neither to infer the
mode nor measure the tempo of cultural change. For these phenomena of interest we must
look to other methods. In this paper, I show that correspondence analysis (CA) offers a means
for analyzing other kinds of evolutionary processes, namely cladogensis and anastomosis, the
latter being especially common in cultural evolution. CA also may reveal lineage gaps or
episodes of punctuated change. This method is applied to Woodland Period ceramic
assemblages from the Deep South.

Law stands at the intersection of symbolic and practical action, directing individual behavior

might such efforts produce? This paper compares the archaeological records of law, legal
practice, sanctioned punishment, and outlaws in early medieval Iceland and Anglo-Saxon
England. We examine what it was like to live within and beyond the law, considering how legal
practices produced enduring and archaeologically recoverable reflections – both material and
symbolic – on landscapes, settlement patterns, and individual bodies.

[137] Spatial Practices and the Constitution of a Late Formative Built Environment:
Architecture at Khonkho Wankane, Bolivia
The construction of a built environment is characterized by many concerns and reflects many
aspects of society. Pragmatic concerns such as available materials, design limitations, and
intended use all contribute to the form of built environments. Additionally, however, a built
environment is constructed within a social context and as such both reflects and recursively
influences sociopolitical dynamics. Viewing spatial organization as a historical process
prompts the realization that it should be a sensitive material indicator of social dynamics. This
paper analyzes spatial practices and architectural development at Khonkho Wankane to

Alabama, Beckum Village and Salt Creek, suggest that the groups that used these salines
created their textiles for different purposes. This paper will compare the personal use textiles
of Beckum Village with the Salt Creek textiles, which appear to have been made specifically
for producing saltpans. While Kimmswick Textile Impressed, var. Langston, ceramics were
recovered from both sites, the differences in the textiles on those ceramics may help define
the boundaries between salt production for personal use and salt production on a larger
group-oriented scale.

[61] Pottery Production and Distribution in the Mimbres and Jornada Regions of the American
Southwest
Use of instrumental neutron activation analysis in research on Mimbres and Jornada Mogollon
ceramic production and exchange has progressed incrementally for more than a decade and
has generated numerous revealing interpretations. Most of these studies, however, have not
included all extant and relevant data. Approximately 3500 Mimbres, Jornada, and related
pottery and clay samples have been analyzed. By combining and reevaluating the extant data
we are able to identify production areas, refine existing ideas, and in some cases offer new
interpretations and research questions regarding issues of production and exchange of pottery
in these regions.

[3] Skeletal Aging from the Sternal Rib: Intercostal Consistency in a Late Antique Provincial
Roman Assemblage
Chronological changes in sternal rib morphology have long been known to have applications
for determination of skeletal age. Unfortunately, this technique has seen limited application in
some circles due to a perception that it is only applicable to the fourth rib. This study
demonstrates a reasonable consistency in sternal rib morphology within individuals from an
archaeological collection recently excavated from a provincial Roman urban center located in
modern day Serbia. It thereby reveals that identification of the fourth rib is not necessary and,
in fact, the use of multiple rib scores is likely to improve the accuracy of the technique.

[108] New Lines of Inquiry for Ritual Assemblages: The View from the Southern Peten
Investigations within the caves of the San Francisco Hills near Cancuén, Peten, Guatemala,
have uncovered evidence of 2000 years of continuous ritual activity. Utilization of these
features is heaviest during the Early Classic period even though no substantial population
centers have been documented until the Late Classic period. Analysis of the materials
recovered from the caves in this system of hills has documented trade, population shifts, and
cultural affiliations previously unrecognized during surface excavations in the region. Such
studies of caves can open up new areas of inquiry and give new insights to the surface
activities of the Maya.

[143] Teotihuacan Architectural Alignments in the Central Maya Lowlands?
During recent surveys in southeastern Campeche, Mexico, numerous formerly unknown
archaeological sites, including major centers, have been recorded. The orientations of the
most prominent buildings largely belong to the so-called 17° family, widely spread throughout
Mesoamerica. Since the observational calendars corresponding to this alignment group in
central Mexico seem to have been an elaborate version of simpler antecedents, suggested by
the orientations in southeastern Campeche, and considering the latter are incorporated in
several Late Preclassic buildings, the origin of this alignment family is likely to be sought in the
Maya area, rather than in Teotihuacan, as has been commonly held.

[58] Adaptational Flexibility Among Preceramic Foragers on the North Coast of Perú
Preceramic foragers of the lower Jequetepeque Valley in northern Perú during the Early to
Mid-Holocene (9000-4500 RCYBP) exhibit tendencies toward increasing complexity, and
persistence of some practices of their Paijanense predecessors (10,800-9000 RCYBP).
Localized settlement/subsistence patterns and occupation of multiple domestic structures
began during this earlier phase. By Middle Preceramic times, populations in this area adjusted
their settlement patterns, constructed rudimentary canals, intensively exploited small-scale
resources, and almost exclusively used expedient technology. Flexibility in Preceramic
lifeways in this area demonstrates the non-unilineal nature of the development of aspects of
socio-economic organization that characterize later Andean civilizations.

Recent combined Czech-American excavations at the Great Moravian center of Breclav-

space. Excavations in the southeastern quadrant of the settlement indicate significant changes
in spatial use over the century-long Great Moravian occupation were likely unintended and
were responses to increased localized flooding as well as the general saturation of this portion
of the site. Such changes appear to be a function of the construction of the rampart, changing
drainage patterns at the site brought about by increased human utilization, and the structure of
the clay-laden sediments in the region.

[12] Encoding Gendered Patterns of Behavior in Archaic Athens
It is proposed by a number of scholars that the social position of women declined during the
sixth century b.c.e in Athens, but this is a period that is not well documented by literary
testimony or excavations. By classifying spectator behavior in vase painting on the basis of
gesture and pose, one finds strongly divergent patterns of behavior for adult and youthful men
and for women. Early images of women reflect ritualized patterns of behavior drawn from
weddings and festivals, later images show more distressed behavior, feeding into stereotypes
of female behavior documented in the later classical period.

[219] Marketing, Obsidian, and Late Classic Economic and Political Changes in South-Central
Veracruz, Mexico
In the Late Classic period (A.D. 600–900) economic and political organization underwent
marked transitions suggesting greater competition, more intensive craft activity at centers, and
likely new or enhanced market activity in the western lower Papaloapan basin, south-central
Veracruz. A previously unified realm dissolved into several smaller polities. I examine fine
prismatic blade production and consumption to evaluate distribution systems. Evidence points
to differential blade production among centers, and I evaluate whether distribution reflects
these differences or if, instead, a pan-polity system, such as marketing, ensured relatively
even distribution to outlying households.

This paper discusses the socio-economic conditions of archaeological knowledge production.
It asks how practical interests characterize archaeological work interrupted by armed conflict.
This question is addressed through an analysis of the problem of commodification of cultural
heritage that is the basis of global cultural imperialism, which is exemplified by the case of the
US-led invasion into Iraq in 2003. The tension that often arises from the contradiction between
such neo-imperial domination and an assumed cultural dependency of those countries studied
by archaeologists can only be solved through a dialectic mediation of theoretical
archaeological knowledge and political activism grounded in recursivity.

[193] The Political, Social and Scientific Contexts of Archaeological Investigations of Mass
Graves in Spain
Forensic archaeological investigations of Spanish Civil War mass graves have the potential to
revive and reconstruct historical memory in Spain. But complex political and social contexts
have created apathy and tension among politicians and the general populace. Formal
government participation has been peripheral at best, and often obstructive. The Catalonian
government recently allowed the search for a mass grave from 1936 but halted efforts after
five days of fruitless exploration. Unrealistic expectations and near-daily policy changes on
whether exhumations will be allowed force archaeologists to choose sites based on politically
motivated availability rather than potential for reconstructing specific historical events.

stated intents of excavation. Socio-political issues can often overshadow the ethical values of
transparency, respectful treatment for the dead, and repatriation although these values should

This study results from the analysis of lithic assemblages recovered at eight Middle and Upper

the determination of hypothetical changes in lithic raw material exploitation strategies during

offered the opportunity to document original technological strategies designed to cope with
specific resource-related stresses in both Middle and Upper Paleolithic contexts, including a

In the middle Savannah valley, the clearest expression of a classic Mississippian adaptation
appears only during the Hollywood phase, when mounds and social ranking expressed in

complicated stamped pottery for at least a century before and after the phase. In this paper,
we use political economy to explore the emergence and structure of Mississippian society in

scales of surplus production, necessitated by life in the Aiken Plateau, fostered social
contradictions making communally-oriented and decentralized societies more sustainable than

[175] The Relationship between Environment and Nutrition on San Nicolas Island, California
Limited terrestrial resources on San Nicolas Island, California forced indigenous populations to
subsist on the abundant marine resources. This paper examines faunal material from sixteen
sites to explore the relationship between population and environment. Excellent preservation
of eco-facts allows for the determination of relative frequencies of species in the diet. Simple
frequencies fail to reflect nutritional importance so calculations of meat and protein yields are
used as better indicators. The analysis focuses on the vitamin contribution of some shellfish
species to the maintenance of health. Results of the analysis are compared with evidence of
paleopathology in skeletal material.

[95] Household Archaeology and the East Field at Isthmia, Greece: Interpreting Domestic
Space at a Ritual Center
Isthmia, location of the major Panhellenic Sanctuary of Poseidon, sits astride the major route
from central to southern Greece. While excavations since the 1950s focused on the
monumental public structures, work also revealed several large domestic quarters, one just
east of the temple complex. Our study examines excavation records to undertake spatial and
functional analysis of this area that dates to the Late Roman era by means of GIS. It will also
compare the East Field to the Hellenistic settlement, located on a ridge to the south of the
sanctuary. The study explores the interplay of ritual and domestic landscapes.

[21] Early Copper Age Circular Enclosures: An Analysis of Vészto-Bikeri and Körösladány-
Bikeri
The recent excavations of Vészto-Bikeri and Körösladány-Bikeri located within the Great
Hungarian Plain have confirmed the presence of a series of three circular enclosures
surrounding both sites. This presents an interesting contradiction to what was previously
thought about Early Cooper Age sites (ca. 6500–5000 BP), in that archaeologists originally
argued that the conclusion of the Late Neolithic (ca. 8500–6500) brought an end to the
appearance of defensive sites. This presentation will focus on a reevaluation of the function of
these sites and the enclosures to include, among other things, the possibilities of defense and
animal containment.

[134] The Magdalenian Occupations of El Miron Cave (Cantabria, Spain)
Excavations since 1996 in El Miron Cave, located in the Cantabrian Cordillera of northern
Spain, have revealed a sequence from the late Mousterian through the Bronze Age. Among
the richest levels are those of the Magdalenian & Azilian, dated by 30 14C assays between
17-10,000 BP. Occupations ranged from major, multi-purpose, residential stays with many
structures to more ephemeral visits. Subsistence relied on hunting of both red deer & ibex,
plus salmon fishing, but activities were highly varied, some involving use of bone needles.
Lithic raw material catchment areas changed through time. Early Magdalenian inhabitants
created significant works of both portable & rupestral art and ornaments.

[148] Calm Before the Storm: The Wea Town of Kethtippecanunk
The town of Kethtippecanunk, in Tippecanoe County, Indiana, was burned by the Kentucky
militia in 1791. This occurred during a time of increasing conflict between American settlers
and the Native peoples of the Wabash River valley. At this point, near the end of the fur trade
period, the traditional leadership structure of the Wea had broken down and large-scale white
settlement and subsequent removal were looming on the horizon. Materials recovered from
two excavation seasons at Kethtippecanunk represent a snapshot of Native American
economy during the period immediately prior to a dramatic change in their way of life.

[49] Prehistoric Antemortem and Perimortem Skeletal Trauma from Central California Site CA-
ALA-613/H, located in Pleasanton, California
Analysis of 473 human burials from CA-ALA-613/H yielded 22 individuals that showed skeletal
evidence of violence either before or around the time of death. Violence related trauma in this
group included scalping, forearm trophy-taking, parry fractures, projectile point injuries, and
sharp-force trauma to the neck. Although skeletal evidence of prehistoric violence is relatively
rare in central California archaeological sites, a growing body of data from bioarchaeological
studies in recent years indicates that interpersonal violence and trophy-taking was common
within the San Francisco Bay Area prior to European contact.

[134] Thoughts on Neolithic Stone Vessels from Franchthi Cave, Greece
The excavations at Franchthi Cave yielded a plethora of remains dated from the Upper
Palaeolithic through the end of the Neolithic period. Among them are about ten Neolithic stone
vessels. There are three interesting things about this small sample: 1. they are made of non
local stones; 2. they are all fragmentary; 3. with one exception, they all retain a rim or handle
portion of the vessel. Interestingly, similar patterns are observed in other Aegean Neolithic
assemblages. In this paper I investigate these patterns in an attempt to understand the
meaning and function of stone vessels in Neolithic Greece.

[135] In/different Landscapes: Heritage and Inequality at the Limits of the Mauryan Empire
As perceived markers of Mauryan imperial integration, the Asokan edicts (3rd century BC)
figure prominently in official narratives of early Indian unity. However, as monuments reflecting
a shared sense of national heritage, these inscriptions occupy some very different landscapes
across the modern Indian nation. This paper presents a view of the edicts from a local
perspective in rural Karnataka. By contrasting this view with other regional, and national
perceptions of the Mauryan empire, an argument is made that the unequal distribution of value
placed on monuments runs parallel to larger national and global inequalities of socio-economic
development and incorporation.

[198] From Dedication Burials to Murals: Re-Interpreting the Teotihuacan Animal Imagery
More than 77 animal remains have been found in the Moon Pyramid including cainids, felids,
serpents and eagles. Burial contexts indicate that virtually all animals were sacrificed and
dedicated to newly constructing monuments. Preliminary species identification on these fauna
led us to question some of the taxonomic classifications that are assigned to the animal
representations in Teotihuacan. In re-considering which species were depicted, we must also
question the validity of the symbolism that has been inferred to the murals. We especially
focus on some of the cainid and felid species that are found abundantly in both burials and
murals.

[68] Residential Burial, Gender Roles, and Political Development in Late Prehistoric and Early
Cherokee Cultures of the Southern Appalachians
Native people in the southern Appalachians began placing graves in and around residences in
the thirteenth century A.D. Burials previously were placed in specialized burial mounds that
likely belonged to individual kin groups. For several centuries, the practice of residential burial
was contemporary with burial in or near public buildings that sometimes were built on platform
mounds. During this time, residential vs. 'public' burial became related to spatial symbolism of
gender and leadership roles. These changes suggest a developmental trajectory that
distinguishes Southern Appalachian societies from their contemporaries elsewhere in the
southeastern U.S.

[45] The Transition from Hunting to Domestication at the Wangbabozi prehistoric Settlement:
Late Neolithic to WeiJin Dynasties – North East China
Zooarchaeological remains from Wangbabozi indicate variations in patterns of animal
resource utilization from the late Neolithic to WeiJin Dynasties (316AD). The inhabitants
gradually consumed more domestic animals while decreasing their consumption of wild
animals. They exploited four wild animals significantly more than others; wild pig, domestic
pig, red deer and roe deer. Climatic shifts and changes in human population played roles in
altering their consumption patterns, which resulted in decreasing wild resources near the
settlement. This is interpreted as an increased intensity in environmental resource utilization
due to population increase which subsequently forced people to husband animals (Davis,
2005).

[69] Sacrificial Dialectics and the Emergence of Political Hierarchy
This paper explores the causative link between the emergence of stratified polities in
prehistory and the coalescence of political theologies founded upon ritualized violence. A
comparison of sacrificial ideologies cross-culturally reveals that the religious rationale of early
states was often grounded in dialectical metaphysics that framed comparable theories of
action, change, empowerment, and social differentiation. I argue that the effective politicization
of such native anthropologies/cosmologies—particularly the notion that order and reproduction
(in their myriad manifestations) are consummated through acts of consumptive destruction—
played a critical role in the development of hierarchical polities in both the Old and New
Worlds.

Archaeologists have long maintained the upper hand in directing treatment priorities for

benefit a diverse public, some circumstances may merit valuation of archaeological sites from
the perspective of their tribal value, and this is likely not as conventional archaeological
resources. Subjugating archaeological methods in favor of other approaches that are more
meaningful to associated communities may also serve to reveal the broader significance of
such places to the public-at-large.

sculpture and one of the easternmost where Olmec artifacts have been recovered.
Geophysical surveys were integrated with archaeological excavations adjacent to one of the
largest earthen platform mounds, built early in its history. Interpretation of geophysical data
and analysis of cultural material from excavations are helping to understand how the
construction and significant expansion of these mounds altered the Early Formative physical
environment in dramatic ways, both reflecting and intensifying social differentiation and
concentration of political power.

[119] Stories Shared: On the job training at the UCLA Fowler Museum
I will always thank NAGPRA for saving archaeological collections. Ten years ago the UCLA
archaeology collections were in bad shape and in need of rehabilitation to make them more
usable and accessible for research. Through NAGPRA consultation with tribal members
questions were asked and observations made that really shaped the priorities and ways of
curating the collections. One result was realizing the need to reconnect with previous UCLA
archaeologists and learning the oral history of these collections. This paper will share some
lessons learned and stories shared from the indigenous communities and the many benefits
received from their involvement and partnerships.

[171] 3DGIS and Memory: Virtual Reconstructions of 1920s Rosewood, Florida and Its Public
Archaeology Potential
In the early 20th century, race riots, lynchings and destruction of black homes were common
headlines. One of the best known cases involved the 1923 destruction of Rosewood, Florida.
Eight people died, and buildings were put to the torch by a white mob. While archaeological
deposits at Rosewood are likely well preserved, much of the land is currently owned by white
landowners hostile to the concept of remembering what happened there. What options are left
to archaeologists who investigate these sites when traditional archaeological methods are
unavailable? The use of 3D GIS and the Internet provides one compelling answer.

Site (XMK 030)
One of the earliest sites on the Pacific coast of the upper Alaska Peninsula is the lower locus
of the Mink Island site (XMK 030), dated between 6300 +/- 50 and 4180 +/- 40 uncalibrated
years BP. Excavation of the lower locus by the National Park Service produced tens of
thousands of lithic artifacts constrained by more than 40 radiocarbon dates. This project offers
an opportunity to describe early lithic technology on the Pacific coast of the upper Alaska

[158] Branching vs. Blending is Not the Question
The straightforward application of phylogenetic techniques to cultural datasets has
engendered facile readings of phylogenetic results as straightforward descriptions of cultural
evolutionary trends. We argue, however, that many cultural phylogenetic interpretations are
influenced by 1) the inability to simultaneously evaluate phylogenetic and non-phylogenetics
models, and 2) the false view that particular explanatory models can be divorced from the
generation of data to which they are applied. We illustrate an alternative approach to
explaining homologous similarity by applying phylogenetic and reticulate models to Pacific
linguistic and material culture datasets and compare the conclusions and limitations of each
model.

[161] Soil Chemistry in the Search for Ancient Maya Marketplaces at Chunchucmil, Yucatan,
Mexico
Other than rocks that demarcate individual selling space, contemporary marketplaces in
Mesoamerica leave few signs of the trade activities. It is unlikely that artifactual evidence of
ancient marketplaces would remain as they are cleaned at the end of each market day. Our
objective was to use soil chemical analysis of a variety of public spaces at Chunchucmil to
identify ancient marketplaces. Patterns of extractable phosphorus in the soils of both
contemporary and ancient market plazas have indicated years of food trade at certain
locations. These methods hold promise in resolving the vexing question of how large ancient
Maya urban populations were sustained.

Macaúba I site is spread over 2.242m² of an inter-fluvial area of the Brazilian mid-western

ceramic period dating 1.088+/-36 B.P and, above this, a pre-ceramic period associated with
2BC Cambisoil horizon, resulting from soil and sediments accumulation due to
erosive/depositional processes. There are two main hypotheses for the lithic/soil association:
1) The relief modeling process covered the cultural vestiges in their original context and 2) the
artifacts were incorporated in the soil/sediment flow during transportation.

Southwestern archaeology in the early 21st century resembles, in some important ways, the
archaeology of a century ago - a time when archaeologists listened to the stories of Native
people, interacted with Indian people on a daily basis, advocated for some Native American
Indian issues, and understood that without (at least tacit) Native approval, the archaeological
research simply wasn’t going to materialize. Today, as litigation and legislation are
increasingly unattractive ways to settle conflicts over cultural patrimony and intellectual
property rights, Southwestern archaeologists are once again actively involved in resolving
disputes between American Indians and the non-Indians who wish to study them.

comparison to field notes indicates what was available both locally and through trade, and
what was culturally acceptable for use by elites of the society.

governed by weighted parameters. Corporate behavior emphasizes a leader’s social
connections, while network behavior favors the acquisition of wealth. We evaluate a
hypothesis that change in the social perception of a leader’s responsibility is a principal factor
in change in leadership strategies.

dominated terraces. Deer, rabbits, and other small mammals characterize the faunal
assemblage to the virtual exclusion of bison and pronghorn that, at times, undoubtedly
occupied nearby uplands. FCR features are consistent with the inferred importance of locally

[190] Dental Enamel Hypoplasia in Late Pleistocene Grazers in the Southern Plains:
Implications for Clovis-Era Paleoecology
Dental enamel hypoplasia (DEH) in mammals indicates nutritional stress during tooth
mineralization. Paleoindian-age droughts are well-documented and likely affected forage for
large herbivores like Bison and Equus. Some late Pleistocene Equus in the Southern High
Plains exhibit DEH, while DEH appears rare in Bison, even in drought-coincident sites. We
predict that Equus with DEH will correspond to droughts in the terminal Pleistocene. This
higher incidence of DEH in Equus than Bison may indicate that horses were more susceptible
than the large bovids to the terminal Pleistocene environmental changes.

[26] The Cancuen Ballcourts as Reflection and Reinforcement of the Multiple Levels of Classic
Maya Political Alliance, Hegemony, and World View
The ballcourts of the Classic Maya gateway center of Cancuen were variable in form and
function reflecting its interregional nature and political and “ethnic” complexity. The great
ballcourt of Taj Chan Ahk was a political instrument of alliance. The central ballcourt fulfilled
multiple religious, social and political roles. The northern ballcourt was a center of local
feasting of non-elite groups with non-elite ceramics of variable regional styles. Extensive
excavations and analyses have sought to describe and interpret this variability in ballcourt
architecture and artifacts. Here the sociopolitical implications of this variability are also
explored.

[105] Dendroclimatology of the Los Alamos Area
Dendroclimatology is the application of tree-ring data to understanding past climate variation.
This project uses abundant living tree and archaeological tree-ring series data from a wide
geographic area to generate the most detailed precipitation reconstruction yet available for the
northern Rio Grande. These data provide information concerning both low-frequency, long-
term precipitation variation, and the frequency and magnitude of extreme events. Comparing
these data to the archaeological record of the Pajarito Plateau provides new insights into the
adaptive behavior of past peoples of the area.

[18] The Heart Extraction Rite among the Prehispanic Huaxtec People
The prehispanic Huaxtec people produced an immense amount of in-the-round stone
sculptures. Some of the figures illustrate human sacrifice involving heart extraction. These
figures represent males that have a skeleton hanging from their backs with a heart protruding
from the ribcage. This paper will analyze examples of this sacrificial practice, its patterns, and
associated iconography. It will also present a hypothesis of how these sculptures were sacred
icons used in a specific ritual that continued to evolve through time until it was adopted by the
Aztecs.

[191] Llama Caravans and Obsidian Circulation in the South-Central Andes
Changes in mode of transport can have measurable effects on the distribution of
archaeological materials. In the south-central Andes, camelid domestication and eventual
llama caravan networks provided a less costly means of transporting goods through the
Andean highlands. These caravans were a part of sweeping socio-economic changes,
including early social competition. To what degree were early caravans responsible for the
increases in the presence of non-local goods and wider stylistic distributions in the Early
Formative (1800BCE)? This question is addressed using evidence from research at the
Chivay obsidian source and at consumption sites in the larger region.

center. New field work between 1998–2004 located palisade features on the west side of
Cahokia’s Grand Plaza. Building on past palisade investigations, we now have a more
complete picture of the configuration and timing of the construction of this massive wall, and
can discuss the role that the palisade played in Cahokia’s defense and in the historical
trajectory of this community during the 12th and 13th centuries AD.

[49] Do Differences in Mortuary Treatment Reflect Differences in Status? Isotopic
Investigations of Mortuary Variability at Harris Creek-Tick Island
The Harris Creek (Tick Island) site is a Middle Archaic shell mound in Volusia County, Florida.
In 1961, Ripley Bullen excavated over 175 human burials from the site and suggested
differences in mortuary treatment reflected differences in social status. We explore this
hypothesis through the analysis of light stable carbon and oxygen isotopes derived from
human and faunal remains. Models are developed and evaluated to explain differences in
mortuary treatment at the site. Differences in δ 13C and δ 18O ratios suggest the burials
represent at least two groups of people—one local and one or more extra-local.

Analysis of skeletal trauma from the Wari capital site is crucial for evaluating the role of
violence within this Middle Horizon (AD600-1000) Andean state. While iconographic evidence
suggests that violence and militarism were important facets of Wari ideology, no osteological
studies of Huari skeletons have evaluated physical traces of actual violence. This paper
reports cranial trauma data from 33 individuals from the Monqachayoq sector at Huari,
demonstrating that half of the children and over two-thirds of the adults exhibit pre- and peri-
mortem cranial fractures. These new data are compared to three other Wari affiliated
populations previously analyzed by this author.

at regular intervals. As we search for catalysts for transformative events, quotidian human
decisions, behaviors, and actions tend to drop out of the picture. Ancestral Puebloans
referenced the past at different scales, revisiting events within living memory, and constructing
imagined, ancestral pasts. At Chaco Canyon, symbolic threads such as directionality and
dualism extend across centuries but were continually reworked within changing sociopolitical
contexts.

[169] A Predictive Model of Archaeological Potential: An Example from Northwestern Belize
An inductive predictive modeling approach is used to identify areas of high archaeological
potential in a portion of the central Maya lowlands. This process incorporates information
about known archaeological sites using Geographic Information Systems, remote sensing,
and advanced statistical techniques. Both present-day and ancient landscape characteristics
are considered for their predictive utility. Areas of high archaeological potential are identified
which could contain previously undiscovered sites. Future archaeological surveys should
focus on these regions to decrease time, effort, and expenses and increase overall
archaeological yield.

[112] Transformations in Hide Scraping Technology on the Southern Plains
The period A.D. 1300-1800 was marked by a series of important changes in bison hide
processing on the southern Plains. Early on production was for household use. Prior to contact
production expanded to include trade. Post-contact the scope of production increased to
include the world market. We assess arguments that as hide production intensified scraper
production design became less formal and more expedient while the tools themselves became
more expendable.

[70] Topolobampo Bay: a Historical Archaeology Perspective
In 1886, Albert K. Owen established an agricultural colony: The Credit Foncier Company.
These pioneers, mostly American, lived and worked in these settlements, under a Socialist
Utopia ideology. By 1890, the colony underwent important productive changes until its
abandonment in 1903. This paper presents a research proposal undergoing a Historical
Archaeology perspective. Photographs of the colony, maps and historical documents will be
combined with archaeological methods and materials, in order to reconstruct some aspects of

[200] Is it Possible to Speak of a Shell Mollusk's Technological Tradition in Prehispanic Central
Mexico?
In recent years in Templo Mayor Museum, Mexico City, has been developed an experimental
archaeology project, one of which main goals is the knowledge of the technological traditions
that took place in different times and places of Prehispanic Mexico. In the present work the
results of the analyses of four different collections of shell objects are presented, which
encompass more than 2,000 years of central Mexico´s history, from Early Formative to the
Arrival of the European conquerors (1850 B.C.–1521 A.P.). These data allows the discussion
on the existence of one or more traditions of shell work in the mentioned region.

[146] Persistence and Change of Native American Belief Systems on San Nicolas Island,
California
European contact and expansion in California had profound effects on the traditional lifeways
of Native Peoples living on the Channel Islands. To examine the effects of colonialism on
Native American cultural and spiritual identities, we turn to the archaeological record of San
Nicolas Island with particular emphasis on a large village (CA-SNI-25) intensely occupied
between the 14th and 19th centuries. We focus on the ritualistic interpretation of features as
evidence for persistence and change among native belief systems and conclude by evaluating
these material remains in relation to the Chengiichngech and other historically documented
religious practices.

For three years, Mercyhurst Archaeological Institute (MAI) has conducted data recovery
operations at 41CV115, a rockshelter on Fort Hood, Texas. These investigations have focused
on the Late Prehistoric period component at the site and have resulted in the recovery of a
very substantial corpus of material from this time horizon. Concurrent with these
investigations, MAI has extensively studied the genesis and evolution of the rockshelter itself
as well as the paleoenvironmental parameters within which these geomorphological

[188] "No Child Left Behind": Andronovo Culture Child Burials and Social Complexity
Extant archaeological research on the Eurasian steppe focuses on warrior chiefdoms,
patriarchal systems, and status. While these male oriented perspectives are worthwhile aims,
they only take us part of the way in explaining social complexity in the region. Child and sub-
adult burials are largely missed in both the archaeological record and accompanying literature.
Kurgan (barrow) burials in Kazakhstan from the late Bronze Age indicate a high number of
child and sub-adult burials. I suggest that through the analysis of Andronovo child burials the
relationship between achieved and ascribed status and social complexity can be elucidated.

[170] Engaging the Public: Binghamton University's Community Archaeology Program (CAP)
Historic preservation is based on the premise that identification and protection of significant
sites is in the public interest. However, there are many constituencies that assign "value" to
the preservation of sites: descendent communities, educational communities, landowners, and
archaeologists. This paper discusses Binghamton University's Community Archaeology
Program, which acknowledges these diverse interests, and engages cross-sections of the
public in the process of discovery and stewardship. CAP provides entertainment for our
"passive" audiences, education for those seeking advanced knowledge, and participation for
those who want to be actively engaged in the whole process of archaeology and preservation.

[83] Tiwanaku Ritual and Political Mechanisms as Reflected in Tiwanaku Burial Patterns at El
Convento, Santivañez Valley, Bolivia
During Tiwanaku times, the mound site of El Convento was used, at least partially, as a burial
ground. Our excavations exposed horizontally contiguous burials that each showed the same
orientation. While this presents a rather uniform picture, other burial characteristics inside this
“cemetery” varied considerably, including burial type, number and style of offerings, as well as
number, age, sex and burial position of the deceased, suggesting that socially different people
were buried together. I further discuss grave offerings and their social implications, especially
vessel pairs, often keros, which I argue are related to political rituals of gift-giving and
reciprocity.

[21] Ceramic Vessel Type Use as a Means to Determining Site Function
The 2006 KRAP excavation season at Körösladány-Bikeri finds are inconclusive, if not
contradictory as far as site function is concerned. The association of pottery with every feature
unearthed (pits, baby-burials, a well and a palisade)should work as an aid to determining site
function through the determination of possible vessel type uses. This aspect of pottery
analysis, however, is often neglected. This paper sets out to explore the possible uses of
vessel types through the consideration of spatial and residue analysis as well as the
comparison with the associated site of Vésztö-Bikeri.

Paleoindian and Archaic period artifacts, and documents significant long-term changes in
hunter-gatherer foraging strategies.

[13] Illustrating an Old Debate: Modeling Ancient Fire Events at Tula Grande, Hidalgo Mexico
Remains of burned architecture at Tula Grande are traditionally interpreted as evidence of
raiding events related to the centers depopulation. Aggression, intentional ignition, and
desecration are often assumed without: 1) consideration of competing hypotheses (Midland
fire, accidental human ignition, and intentional termination behavior) or 2) attention to: the
patterning of burned material within and around individual structures. Fire signatures and
architectural details in Edificio IV, an Early Postclassic palace, were documented by examining
excavation notes, photos, and artifacts. Using modeling and visualization programs developed
by modern fire investigators, ignition scenarios and their expected material effects are
compared, directly, to the archaeological record.

[125] Persistently Rare: St. Johns Black-on-Red in the Galisteo Context
White Mountain Redwares are found in low frequencies on Coalition period sites throughout

Systematic examinations of such correlations, however, are scarce, with dominant research
interests focusing on more common types of ceramics. Comparing the distribution of St. Johns
Black-on-Red/polychrome within the sites recorded by the Tano Origins Project and other
excavation and survey data from the surrounding area provides an important test case for
evaluating the potential cultural significance of these ceramics in context.

The interpretation of Spanish-colonial military settlements continues to neglect the historical

indigenous history were at the center? At El Presidio de San Francisco, labor regimes
conscripted indigenous laborers to build the settlement’s quadrangle and fortifications. Thus
the site of El Presidio de San Francisco is ambiguously “authored”: its architecture remains
are just as much indigenous artifacts as a colonial ones. This paper also discusses the diverse
strategies being used by present-day Native Californians to make claims to the colonized
landscape of this former military settlement.

During the early nineteenth century many Algonquin groups within Illinois fractured into
opposing nativist and accomodationist factions. Heavily influenced by the revitalistic
movement led by the Shawnee Prophet, nativists rejected much of Euro- American material
culture in an attempt to recapture sacred power by returning to “traditional” forms of
subsistence, artifact manufacture and use, and clothing. This paper examines how this
strategy played out in actuality by using subsistence, material culture, and other
archaeological data recovered from sites occupied during the War of 1812 era by central
Illinois Kickapoo nativist factions who were among the strongest supporters of the Prophet.

Recent excavations at Pachacamac in Central Peru resulted in the discovery of a number of
large ceramic vessels at the Pilgrims' Plaza (AD 450-1533) in front of the Pachacamac
Temple. Neutron activation analyses yielded a relatively homogeneous elemental fingerprint.
A clay from the excavation site is used for systematic laboratory firing studies. Mössbauer
spectra of the fired clay and of ancient ceramics are compared in an attempt to assess ancient
firing procedures. The most characteristic feature of the material is an unusually high content
of hematite which undergoes the Morin transition on cooling to 4.2 K.

[35] Prehistoric Settlement and Climate in the Mirador Basin
Sediment cores from the Mirador Basin provide detailed records of human impacts and
climate variability for the last 9500 years. The arrival of maize agriculture ~4600 BP is followed
by accelerated deforestation that persisted until ~1000 BP. Within this period of prehistoric
settlement, three distinct local abandonments are evident: 520- 330 BC, AD 110–230, and AD
900 to present. Climate is relatively dry from ~4500–1000 BP suggesting drier conditions in
this humid tropical environment may have been beneficial for prehistoric agriculture and
settlement. All indicators of human activity disappear permanently ~AD 900, coincident with a
dramatic transition to a wetter climate.

of agricultural features such as causeways, canals and raised fields also carry meaning. Three
archaeological examples from the Bolivian Amazon include agricultural infrastructure that is
still extant. Variation in the spatial patterns of these earthworks suggests variation in forms of
social organization encoded in these patterns. The histories of several spatial patterns are

The burial of domestic dogs is a cultural practice that is both chronologically and

caves to prehistoric people. While caves certainly served as a place of shelter for many
cultures, they also served as ceremonial sites-a practice that dates to Upper Paleolithic times.
This paper explores the significance of burying dogs in caves and how this relates to the ritual
practices of prehistoric cultures.

Were the stone towers of the Gallina Culture of Northern New Mexico defensive structures?
The earliest towers (AD. 1050-1100) were contemporary and possibly a reaction to the

13th century, when cliff dwellings and towers were also constructed in the Mesa Verde region.
Perhaps protective functions of Gallina towers would be clearer if we could envision the role of
spirits in pueblo warfare. In this paper I explore the possibility that the Gallina deployed the

The collective burials of Neolithic/Copper Age Portugal (3500–2000 BC) provide an extensive
skeletal record from which to test the hypothesis that increased social complexity in this time-

the health of individuals from a community in prehistoric Portugal based upon the author's
analysis of (>1500) teeth from the Late Neolithic burial cave Feteira (II), and then compares
these findings with published data from other skeletal collections of similar location and time-

[201] Unlocking the Gate: Opening Archaeology to Indigenous Voices
The conflict over the Ancient One and Spirit Cave Man must be seen to be more than a
conflict over scientific "rights" to study the past. While scientists celebrate the retention of
"data", Indigenous groups lament the loss of the very fabric of their identity. The archaeologist,
as a supposedly objective observer, is given a status that is "better" merely because it is
based in western scientific thought. This paper reminds archaeologists that, while archaeology
has been used in service to the state, archaeologists must be aware of how it can be used to
undermine the identity of other cultures.

Having received limited attention, in comparison to Ireland’s archaeological cultural materials,
dental anthropological research was undertaken on skeletal collections dating from Ireland’s
Neolithic (c. 4000–1800 BC) to its Early Christian era (c. AD 400–1170). The primary reason
for this research was to accumulate bioarchaeological data to inform hypotheses concerning
large-scale population intrusions in ancient Ireland. In addition to finding patterns of
morphometric variation with marked homogeneity between temporal populations, a previously
unreported dental morphometric trait was discovered and regional patterning of dental
variation, similar to findings from prior physical anthropological and genetic research, was
revealed.

[61] Understanding and Minimizing Sources of Error in Radiocarbon Dating
The conventional radiocarbon dating method has been used by archaeologists for more than
50 years. It is the primary means of establishing the necessary chronological framework for
creating hypotheses and interpreting archaeological assemblages. There are, however,
several sources of uncertainty when calculating dates from archaeological samples.
Laboratory protocols minimize the effects of systematic and random errors. The archaeologist,
however, can assist the laboratory in minimizing error by choosing the best possible samples
for dating. We present some of the sources of error in an effort to assist the archaeologist,
both in the field and during interpretation of radiocarbon dating results.

Texas during the Late Holocene?
Body size in white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) decreases with population density. If
pottery use in southeast Texas enhanced human foraging efficiency, carcass exploitation, and
food-storage capacity enough that harvest pressure on deer decreased, then deer body size
should also have decreased with reduced harvest pressure and resulting higher population
densities. The faunal assemblage from the Eagle’s Ridge Site (41CH252) in southeast Texas
spans the pre-pottery, pottery transition. Measurements of white-tailed deer astragali are used
to evaluate whether or not deer body size decreased through time.

these and related issues, such as promotion and tenure, or intellectual property, are at the
moment addressed by general discussions on digital scholarship, others are specific to

do not provide datable deposits. Effigy stumpware surface-collected in Ballard County and
Varney red-filmed sherds in AD 1100-1175 deposits at Wickliffe (15BA4) indicate an Emergent
Mississippian horizon in the area. Marshall (15CE27) and Rowlandtown (15McN3) yielded
deposits with ceramics that are shell tempered but can be characterized as transitional
between Baytown and Mississippian types. The 2 σ ranges of the 14C dates are fairly wide,
but argue for a pre-AD 900 introduction of shell tempering.

[186] A Lucre Mortuary Edifice
For the time period extending from the Middle Horizon to the Late Intermediate Period in the
southern highlands of Peru, the site of Cotocotuyoc in the Huaro Valley presents strong
evidence for material culture continuity. The excavation of a Lucre funerary edifice during the
2006 field season brought to light new data linking later mortuary traditions to earlier Middle
Horizon ones in the region. This continuity can be traced in both funerary architecture and
associated burial goods. The interment of the dead, however, shows important changes
hinting at the broader socio-political changes occurring during this time.

[102] Forensic Archaeology and Identification - The Role of Paranasal Sinuses
Forensic archaeological sciences are utilised in mass disasters and terrorist acts, including
identification issues. In 10% of medico-legal cases, remains are initially unidentified, with the
majority eventually identified using comparative radiology. Paranasal sinus radiographs have
been extensively used in identifying unknown persons, based on the hypothesis that each
sinus is unique. The accuracy of this theory has not been determined definitively, undermining
the legal validity of such identification. The enigmatic nature of the paranasal sinuses may yet
yield the necessary evidence. Factors controlling pneumatisation remain unclear, although
genetic influences appear critical. This suggests the possibility of identification of family units.

[131] The House and the Lineage: Bilaterality and Unilineality in Pueblo Social Organization
How did Pueblo groups migrate? The prevailing anthropological model of an Eastern Pueblo-
Western Pueblo dichotomy between bilateral and unilineal kinship systems, with moieties or
exogamous matrilineages structuring social organization, respectively, rests upon mid-20th
century descent theory. As an alternative, this paper assesses the utility of the 'house'
(bilateral) model especially for the Hopi (of pre-split and splitting Orayvi), a classic case of the
Western lineage-based system. If bilateral houses were the foundation of matriclan formation,
explanation of Pueblo social structures, their fissions, and movements may not need to be so
dichotomous after all.

[41] Archaic Rock Art and the Mid-Holocene Optimum in the Far West
A well-documented Archaic rock art florescence has been documented in central Utah, the
Pecos region of Texas, and central Baja California during the Mid-Holocene Optimum (ca.
4000–2000 YBP). Recent research adds the Chumash rock art of the Carrizo Plain, CA, to this
list. Combined with settlement data, this indicates that ritual elaboration and intensity (and
certain cases, population size) reached their peaks long before the Late Prehistoric in these
regions. Given that religious and political authority were often homologous, this suggests that
the evolution of prehistoric socio-political organization was more complicated than existing
models allow.

collecting evidence and maintaining the chain-of-custody, excavating decomposed remains,
and analyzing remains and personal effects to successfully determine the manner and cause
of death. Thus, the students not only became skilled in excavation techniques, but also
became aware of the broader applications of archaeology.

Radiocarbon dating of long barrows and causewayed enclosures in southern Britain, with

Creating a Home where the Buffalo Roam: Contributions of Zooarchaeology to the
Management of Tallgrass Prairie Preserves
Zooarchaeology has been increasingly used to inform modern conservation decisions. In the
Great Plains, bison herds are a common component of habitat restoration efforts. The impact
of these animals on ecological communities has led to the characterization of bison as a
keystone species. In the fragmented landscapes of the eastern Plains there are few
opportunities to assess the appropriateness of bison management strategies. Characteristics
of prehistoric bison assemblages are a valuable archive of population characteristics (e.g.,
dietary niche, movement patterns, animal density, etc.). This study highlights differences
between archaeological bison assemblages and management goals in three modern tallgrass

Florida: Implications of OSL Dating
Buried archaeological sites in sandy substrates are common in Florida, but away from

incremental eolian sedimentation and pedoturbation being the most commonly cited
mechanisms. The results of geoarcheological studies sponsored by Avon Park Air Force
Range and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Fort Worth District, indicate that site burial was
most likely the result of pedoturbation. The data suggest that the traditional interpretation of
such site contexts as in situ buried occupation surfaces in incrementally aggrading eolian sand

Although Chinese looking artifacts have long been quintessential "exotic objects" for Western
consumption, localised permutations of this exoticization vary through time and space. With
these objects, visual markers of "foreignness" that may have been salient to some non-
Chinese groups were not important to others. Furthermore, for Chinese individuals these
artifacts likely had still different connotations. Can archaeologists trace the complex and often
divergent genealogies of the "exotic" in Chinese artifacts? This question is addressed by
investigating the historical trajectories of artifacts manufactured in China, Europe, Japan and

[49] Mortuary Evidence for Pagan and Christian Ideologies in Seasonality of Conception, Birth

Results from solar orientation analyses revealed pronounced seasonality in conception, birth
and death of infants from the Kellis II cemetery (c. 50–350AD). Using solar orientation
combined with developmental age-at-death data, calendrical weeks of infant birth and
conception were estimated. Peak infant death was consistent with birthing-age females and
known seasonal infant mortality in Egypt. Practices relating to the disposal of the dead in Kellis
II strongly suggest a Christian ideology attached to the mortuary treatment of these infants. In
opposition to this, conception and birth may have been related to atavistic ideology associated
with seasonal rites and the pagan Egyptian calendar.

[5] Soil Type and Prehistoric Site Location in Knox County, Ohio: A GIS Analysis
This poster explores the relationship between soil type and site location within Knox County,
Ohio, using GIS analysis. By overlaying site maps with soil charts in a GIS database we
examine how soil type relates to the type of site (burial, habitation, lithic reduction) in a
particular area. From the Archaic through the Late Prehistoric periods, local residents
consistently settled on a wide range of soils in the project area, indicating similar exploitation
strategies before and after the introduction of horticulture. Additionally, we examine how
knowledge of this relationship will help future archaeologists identify Native American sites in
the region.

[212] New Data, New Dilemmas: Communities of the Lower Savannah
Although a well-traveled thoroughfare throughout its history, the Savannah River Valley and its
numerous mound centers have received relatively little archaeological attention. The
prehistoric relationships among these communities often have been inferred from scant or
nonexistent data. Recent excavations at a cluster of Hollywood Phase (A.D. 1250-1350)
mound centers in the south-central portion of the valley begin to shed light on the sociopolitical
roles these groups may have occupied. The resulting data and implications afford an
opportunity to critically evaluate these polities against traditional models of Mississippian
chiefdoms.

[189] Trade and Transit in the Heart of the Great Western Trade Route
The Upper Pasión kingdom and the region immediately to the south were an area of high
traffic from the beginnings of Maya civilization through the collapse. Sporadic and uncontrolled
transit typifies the Middle and Late Preclassic, although by the middle of the Early Classic the
area was consolidated as part of the Great Western Trade Route, likely under Tikal’s
auspices. Shifting alliances and a large influx of population in the Late Classic led to largely
local control of the trade route after 600 AD, which lasted until the depopulation of the region
and abandonment of the route in the Terminal Classic.

[33] The Resiliency of Prehistoric Hohokam and Historic Akimel O’odham Societies in the
Middle Gila River Valley
Historic documents and oral histories indicate that the Akimel O’odham in the Gila Crossing
District of the Gila River Indian Reservation were able to farm effectively using canal irrigation
techniques while contending with potentially deleterious ecological conditions such as alkaline
water, flooding, and a major landscape change event. Recent archaeological investigations
suggest that the prehistoric Hohokam had similar capabilities to respond to such conditions
and high and low frequency landscape changes. This poster will review the evidence for
models of salinization and ecological disaster for the Hohokam. The resiliency of Hohokam
and Akimel O’odham societies is demonstrated by this research.

[145] Space, Time and Sustainability: New Evidence and Challenges in the Study of Agrarian
Land Use in Islamic Iberia
Geoarchaeological research in the Lower Alentejo region of Portugal has documented a
temporal correlation between widespread soil erosion and dramatic changes in rural
population densities during the Islamic period. Recent work extended the spatial scale of the
earlier investigation and produced better age estimates for changes in the cultural and
physical landscapes. This research illustrates some of the challenges inherent in linking
environmental change to human activity. It also demonstrates that different scales of
investigation and interpretation can yield different results. Ultimately, the new data may
facilitate a more detailed and nuanced understanding of the factors affecting human-
environment interactions.

[181] New Insights into the Low-Frequency Paleoclimatic Regime of the Mesa Verde Region
A new stratigraphic palynological analysis from southwestern Colorado provides pertinent data
on the low-frequency (>20 years) paleoclimatic regime of the Mesa Verde region from A.D.
500 to 1400. Changes in pollen deposition of climatically sensitive taxa make it possible to
infer fluctuations in regional temperatures as well as in winter and summer precipitation, all of
which likely influenced the region’s agricultural paleoproductivity. The results demonstrate a
general correspondence between population fluctuations and low-frequency climate changes

[117] Urbanism, Economies and Climate Change in the Upper Indus
The earliest evidence for settlement in the Upper Indus dates to 3300 BC when small villages
developed along the Ravi and Beas Rivers. Settlement continued until approximately 1800
BC, perhaps later. Survey data from Beas sites and archaeobotanical evidence from
excavations at Harappa are presented and tested against a new, regionally specific model for
climate change. Combined climatic modeling and settlement data provide reinforcing lines of
evidence concerning the complexities of human ecology during the onset and abandonment of
urbanism and shifts in human responses to changes in precipitation patterns.

[202] Ancient Maya Ceremonial Use of Rockshelters in the Caves Branch River Valley, Belize
Investigations of rockshelter sites in the Caves Branch River Valley during the 2005 and 2006
fieldseasons show change over time in their use by ancient Maya communities. While
diagnostic artifacts, including ceramics and a Lowe point, span the Archaic through
Postclassic periods, associated mortuary ritual appears limited to the Protoclassic. Discussion
of this context includes approximately 90 primary burials from the Caves Branch Rockshelter
site. Intensive Late Classic ritual activity at the rockshelters may involve feasting, as
evidenced by large quantities of jute and burnt faunal bone. These largely overlooked sites are
clearly an important component to ancient Maya ritual.

social, political, religious, and economic events which may occur at Maya marketing locations.
The challenge for archaeologists has been to create testable hypotheses for identifying
prehistoric market places. Here, a proposal presented in 1991 is re-examined in the light of
contemporary scholarship to consider evidence for the presence of a market place at Sayil, a
Terminal Classic Maya center in Yucatan, Mexico.

[199] The Early Holocene Colonization of Southcentral Alaska
The colonization of empty landscapes by small-scale foragers has become a significant area

stratigraphically sealed early-middle Holocene occupations. Both assemblages were
recovered from overlook positions within the river lowlands near the convergence of three
major central Alaska Range drainages, the Susitna, Talkeetna and Chulitna Rivers. These
corridors are believed to have been essential migratory pathways linking the interior and
southcentral regions of the state. Presented here are preliminary findings regarding ages,
stratigraphic sequences, paleoecology and lithic technologies from the Trapper Creek and
Susitna River Overlook sites.

[78] Painted Processions: the Pictorial Program from Mound 2, El Zapotal, Veracruz, Mexico
In 1972 Mexican archaeologist Manuel Torres Guzman excavated Mound 2, El Zapotal, a Late

osteological remains, lifesized terracotta figures, and a mural-covered U-shaped banquette.
Paintings offer a window into creation rituals reinacted by Classic Veracruz deity-
impersonators. Combined with the sculpture, secondary burials, and architectural features
they form part of a larger narrative program. This paper examines the mythological players
and ceremonies depicted on the banquette walls.

[188] The Politics of Sherds: Interpreting the Development of Interregional Early Classic Maya
Interactions at Actuncan, Belize
Political interactions between lowland Maya polities are a central issue in recent studies of the
development of Early Classic Maya politics. The site of Actuncan in the Upper Belize Valley is
located near the highest navigable point of the Mopan River making it a central economic and
political hub in the Western Belize Valley during the Early Classic (AD250-500) period.
Similarities between Early Classic ceramics at the sites of Actuncan and Uaxactún will
illustrate that large scale interaction networks helped the lowland Maya develop increasing
socio-political complexity through the exchange of materials and information.

previous excavations at the site, models on tool acquisition, production, and consumption
were created for the Middle Preclassic, Late Preclassic, and Classic periods. Changes in any
of the chipped stone tool industries were compared to architectural developments at the site to
determine what effects social change may have had on the various tool industries over time.

[193] Preserving World Heritage in Conflict Zone. The Case of Palestine
Archaeology as a non-renewable resource is a burning issue for the West Bank. I discuss four
areas of concern. 1930’s estimates of the number of archaeological sites in the West Bank
exceed 10,000. Many were destroyed in illicit excavations following political instability after the
1967 Israeli occupation. The new Israeli separation wall in the West Bank has affected more
than 4,000 sites. Antiquity laws in both Israel and Palestinian areas work against protection of
archaeological sites. Plans for a potential withdrawal of Israeli forces from the West Bank are
connected with a threat to remove antiquities with Jewish connotations.

This paper presents a current study of the Early Upper Palaeolithic of the Musashino Uplands.
The Musashino Uplands is a part of the South Kanto Plain around Tokyo, in east-central

This update will include an outline of the site distribution and stratigraphic sequences of the
EUP sites and changes in lithic raw material-use during this period. Current issues in the study
of the EUP of the Musashino Uplands will also be discussed.

[125] Pot Drops and “Conspicuous Consumption” in the Galisteo Landscape
Small ceramic scatters or “pot drops” are frequently encountered in the Galisteo Basin.
Anecdotally, most represent painted vessels, while pot drops of utility ware are infrequent.
This is an interesting pattern, since it is often assumed that less formal ceramics would be
used for daily domestic tasks, with more formal vessels being reserved for more restricted
activities. Such a correlation may indeed be represented in excavated assemblages, making
this survey-based evidence more compelling. This poster investigates the hypothesis that the
concept of “conspicuous consumption” may explain the distribution of ceramics across the
Galisteo landscape.

[22] Island Biogeography and Mammoth Extinction: A Test Case from the Pribilof Islands,
Western Alaska
Mammoth remains from the Qagnax Cave site (5400 C14 yr BP), suggest that megafaunal
survival occurred in this remote area of the Bering Sea unoccupied by humans until the late
18th century. Mammoth survival continued against a backdrop of declining island area and
habitat shrinkage. Studies of stable isotopes from the mammoth remains suggest that
vegetational changes during the early to mid-Holocene may have mediated between shrinking
habitat and mammoth survival, thus modifying the strict application of island biogeographical
principles. Eventually, however, such principles prevailed, and along with Holocene volcanism,
may have resulted in the final extinction of the mammoths.

[196] Early Pueblo I Period Pit Structure Architecture: Diversity and Identity In Ridges Basin
Early Pueblo I period pit structures excavated during the Animas-La Plata project display high
levels of stylistic and technical diversity. While some clusters of houses are more
homogeneous in highly visible traits, others exhibit similarities in their internal, less visible
elements. By teasing out these differences with respect to position on the landscape, an
appreciation emerges for the decisions made and agency exhibited by the builders. It is
proposed that houses were actively used on this particular landscape to promote integration
and distinction and that identity creation was a goal of those constructing, living in, and
ultimately destroying these houses.

A considerable portion of our planet’s landscapes either currently supports agriculture or did

landscapes are particularly important because they offer a means through which
archaeologists can assess the long-term impact of human activities on landscape evolution
and biodiversity. Farmers clear forests, construct terraces, manipulate hydrology, and alter soil
chemistry and morphology. In doing so, entire landscapes may be transformed, which can
differentially impact ecosystem properties across time and space. Consequently, the
sustainability of such practices must be judged within multiple temporal and spatial scales.

persons, objects in a bundle contribute uniquely to the aggregate; at the same time, they are
bounded by power relations that may parallel those of the bundle-holding group. Observations
are made on the possible connections among bundle curation, social cohesion, and the
survival of individual and group identity.

Where Oaxaca archaeologists might have deferred to sixteenth and seventeenth written

economic strength. This paper further suggests that these differences were rooted in the
uneven distribution of copper ores and the uneven degree of metal production. Communities
in the ore-rich Southern Urals were actively involved in metal production and traded metals
with communities in the ore-poor Don and Volga River Valleys. Because of the high value of
metals, the former were able to amass greater wealth than the latter.

although domesticated rice remains were found. The earliest domesticated foxtail and
broomcorn millet are from Xinglonggou in northeastern China (7500-7700 BP) in a setting
influenced by the Keerqin Desert. The Zengpiyan site, South China, indicates that rice farming
was not practiced in South China until 6000 BP. Furthermore another independent origin of
agriculture in China may be the Pearl River area where the major crops seem to be roots and
tubers, such as taro.

pukaras with massive external walls and few internal structures could be easily explained as
either defensive or ritual, the Pukara de Khonkho, in Bolivia’s Desaguadero Basin, has signs
of significant long term occupation and smaller terrace walls. This paper presents results from
recent fieldwork at the Pukara de Khonkho, situating this site within the context of a regional
growth in hilltop settlements and suggesting the need for alternative interpretations of different
kinds of high altitude sites.
