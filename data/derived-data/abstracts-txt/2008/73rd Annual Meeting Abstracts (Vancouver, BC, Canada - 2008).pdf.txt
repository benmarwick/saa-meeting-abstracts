[1] SYMPOSIUM · SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE: APPROACHES TO COLLABORATION WITH NATIVE
AMERICAN AND FIRST NATIONS COMMUNITIES
(SPONSORED BY COMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN RELATIONS)
Archaeologists are increasingly interested in collaborating with Indigenous communities.
Only a decade ago interactions between Native Peoples and archaeologists were either
mandated by law or based on necessity. However, more recently, voluntary collaboration
that is mutually desired and beneficial is increasing. This session focuses on such
collaborative efforts with a primary emphasis on partnerships within the Pacific Northwest
region. The papers call attention to the risks, challenges, rewards, and benefits of
collaboration while presenting new directions for research in the next decade and beyond.
They demonstrate that there is something for everyone to gain in collaborative approaches.

RESEARCH: THE KUTOYIS BISON JUMP SITE, TWO MEDICINE RIVER, MONTANA
A collaborative heritage research project was conducted on the Two Medicine River,
Blackfeet Indian Reservation, MT, to assess potential research questions and preservation
priorities at the Kutoyis bison kill site. This session presents results of preliminary work in
four major objectives. First, to assess relationships between the Kutoyis site and
neighboring archaeological sites. Second, to understand the function and extent of the
associated driveline and rock alignments. Third, to determine the taphonomic
characteristics of the bison bone bed. Last, to create an initial geoarchaeological
impression of the site. This research showcases minimally invasive analytical approaches
to heritage management.
[11] POSTER SESSION · NEW APPROACHES TO OLD PROBLEMS: POSTERS SPONSORED BY THE
JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY AND HISTORICAL SCIENCES
Archaeology can be profitably conceived as the intersection between the evolutionary and
social sciences. Although approaches to this intersection vary, this focus combines the
theoretical tools of evolutionary theory, the physical science techniques of biology and the
subject matter of archaeology, enables researchers to explain a broad range of historical
patterns and contingencies in the archaeological record. The research projects presented
in this symposium are examples of the kind of work possible within this framework. These
posters are sponsored by the Journal of Evolutionary and Historical Sciences, an open
access journal that publishes science-based research.
[12] GENERAL SESSION · SUBSISTENCE STUDIES IN THE SOUTHWEST U.S.
[13] SYMPOSIUM · CIRCA 1530: INTEGRATING ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOHISTORY IN THE
ANDES
A number of recent studies in the Andean region of South America have been models of
,   2                                      ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING
integrative, multi-disciplinary approaches to the understanding of Prehispanic and early
vice-regal cultures. Unlike Mesoamerica, there was no tradition of writing in the Andes prior
to the sixteenth century. While khipu and other forms of recording information were used by
indigenous societies, these sources remain difficult of access, leaving researchers to rely,
in varying degrees, on the essential, but problematic early modern sources for information
on Andean life. This session considers the ways in which documentary evidence can be
usefully deployed in Andean archaeology.
[14] SYMPOSIUM · NEIGHBORHOODS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: THE ASSESSMENT OF INTERMEDIATE
UNITS OF SPATIAL AND SOCIAL ANALYSIS
Archaeology has privileged small units of spatial analysis (such as activity areas or
domestic structures) or large units (such as regions), but has not devoted sufficient
research to neighborhoods. The seat of intermediate elites, of foreign groups, or distinct
social or economic units, neighborhoods are perhaps the most dynamic elements of urban
sites, where identities are reinforced. In some sites they may represent the seat of the
original foundational groups. This symposium will review how archaeology may define
neighborhoods in sites such as Teotihuacan, Monte Albán, Xochicalco, Tlaxcala, Copán,
Río Bec, La Joyanca, Mayapán and other Postclassic sites of Yucatán and the Maya
highlands.
[15] SYMPOSIUM · THE POLITICS OF POPULATION REORGANIZATION
Population shifts at a variety of scales are among the most widely documented
archaeological phenomenon. Ecological change and human-resource imbalances have
long been explored as factors precipitating such shifts. However, population movements
and organizational shifts profoundly influence political dynamics: as populations, labor, and
power relations are re-organized, the potential for dramatic change is heightened, though
not always enacted. The contributors to this session explore and model sociopolitical
factors in past population shifts in a spectrum of prehistoric societies in Asia, North and
South America, Europe, and Africa.
[16] SYMPOSIUM · INALIENABLE POSSESSIONS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF MESOAMERICA
(SPONSORED BY ARCHAEOLOGY DIVISION OF THE AAA)
Annette Weiner drew upon Mauss's concept of objects classified as immueble among the
Trobriand Islanders to formulate the concept of "inalienable wealth," in which the social
identity of the owner becomes embedded in the object and forms the basis of its value.
Unlike prestige models, inalienable possessions can be present within any level of
socioeconomic status, be used to authenticate either individual or collective identities, and
be circulated (or non-circulated) to both establish and defeat hierarchy. This symposium will
address methodologies for identifying inalienable possessions in the archaeological record
and present case-studies based on the above criteria.
[17] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE INTERNATIONAL POLAR YEAR: PROGRESS ON SOME
BIG QUESTIONS IN THE CIRCUMPOLAR NORTH
The International Polar Year (IPY) will see a concentrated burst of interdisciplinary research
in 2007 and 2008, relating to all scientific fields at both Poles. A broad range of
international archaeology projects will form a significant part of IPY activities, addressing
issues as diverse as climate change impacts, social interactions, migrations, ethnic
identities, and the relationship between history and modern peoples. This symposium will
provide a snapshot of where archaeology stands midway through the IPY period, allowing
presentation of initial results and also discussion of future directions in what promises to be
a watershed event in circumpolar archaeology.
[18] SYMPOSIUM · FIRST NATIONS AND ARCHAEOLOGY IN BRITISH COLUMBIA: IMPLICATIONS
FOR A THEORY AND PRACTICE OF INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGY
First Nations and archaeologists in B.C. have had a long and at times antagonistic
relationship. In recent years, these groups have been building a wary alliance marked by
the emergence of Indigenous archaeologists and local stewardship solutions. This evolving
relationship - primarily in the context of conflicts over resource developments - has thrust
First Nations and consulting archaeologists in B.C. into the centre of ethical debates at the
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING                                                     3
forefront in global archaeology, including decolonization, intellectual property, and
community-based heritage stewardship. This session will explore the B.C. experience and
its wider implications for a theory and practice of Indigenous archaeology.
[19] SYMPOSIUM · CULTURAL & HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVES ON HUNTING AND GATHERING IN
NORTH AMERICA
Hunter-gatherer archaeology in North America has long addressed the relationship
between humans and their environments. While important, this emphasis can be expanded
to include other, often neglected, dimensions of hunter-gatherer life and to approach
traditional interests in ecology with greater sensitivity to culture and history. Featured are
case studies throughout North America that examine ideology, social relations, gender,
ethnicity, politics and art in hunting and gathering societies; that situate subsistence
pursuits, hunter-gatherer responses to climate change, and adaptations within social and
cultural contexts; and that propose theoretical perspectives and methodological
approaches that will advance our understanding of hunter-gatherer social life.
[20] SYMPOSIUM · SOUTHWESTERN BIOARCHAEOLOGY IN 2008: CURRENT THEMES, ISSUES,
AND RESEARCH TRAJECTORIES
This session presents a series of papers demonstrating the current scope of research
topics, methods, and issues in Southwestern bioarchaeology. Work is conducted in
academic, CRM and tribal contexts, and proceeds through the collaboration of multiple
constituencies. Skeletal indications of diet and health are compared for populations and
communities; nonlethal trauma and skeletal indications of intensive labor reveal gender
based status differences; ancient DNA is used to reconstruct migration and settlement
patterns; mortuary ritual is reconstructed through archaeological and taphonomic data. The
session also addresses the critical issues of data quality, data curation, and the challenges
to regional synthesis.
[21] GENERAL SESSION · WOODLAND AND MISSISSIPPIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
[22] SYMPOSIUM · SUBSISTENCE, SETTLEMENT, AND SOCIETY: FORMATIVE EAST AND SE               ASIA
IN COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE
The symposium have three principal thematic foci: (1) discussion of final foraging
economies and the transition to agriculture in East and Southeast Asia, (2) studies of early
village life, and (3) the development of early hierarchical societies in this same area. Our
aim is to bring together scholars with diverse backgrounds and theoretical interests to
discuss and debate these issues in an explicitly comparative perspective. This panel is
conceived of as not only a vehicle for greater understanding of formative Asian prehistory,
but also as a theoretical and empirical contribution to a comprehensive understanding of
formative society in global perspective.
[23] GENERAL SESSION · STUDIES OF GENDER AND SOCIAL IDENTITY IN MESOAMERICA
[24] SYMPOSIUM · RESIDUES OF TECHNOLOGY: EXPERIMENTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO
ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS
Technology is a cultural universal; however, interpretations of the archaeological record are
often hindered by a researchers' failure to completely understand prehistoric technologies.
Experimental archaeology offers the ability to gain a more in depth understanding of
prehistoric technological residues and by extension prehistoric life. This session capitalizes
on the contributions of experimental archaeologists employing a variety of approaches to
their research while maintaining similar standards of conduct including: (a) thorough
background research, (b) experiments, based upon the archaeological record designed to
answer valid archaeological questions, (c) effective implementation of experiments, (d)
exhaustive data recording, and (e) meaningful interpretation of results.
[25] SYMPOSIUM · SOCIO-LEGAL CONSTRUCTIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE:
INTERSECTIONS IN RIGHTS AND REGULATIONS, OBJECTS AND CULTURES, AND IDENTITY AND
INDIGENEITY
This session addresses new directions in socio-legal scholarship at national and
,   4                                      ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING
international levels. The manifestations through which the remnants of the past are
embedded and articulated in culture, history, and memory have intensified as legal
classificatory schemes increasingly engage contemporary negotiations of heritage. There
has been a growing need for both tangible and intangible archaeological heritage to be
defined in and by law in order to implement protective policies, repatriation procedures,
private versus public ownership rights, and cultural and intellectual property regulations.
The session facilitates an understanding of how law inextricably intersects how heritage is
constructed and construed.
[26] GENERAL SESSION · STUDIES IN WOODLAND CERAMICS AND SYMBOLISM
[27] SYMPOSIUM · HIGHLIGHTING CONTEXT AND DIVERSITY IN THE IMMIGRANT EXPERIENCE
Archaeological studies of minority immigrant groups in western North America have
traditionally focused on issues of acculturation and ethnic continuity. However, recent data
is revealing considerable diversity in material strategies of adaptation, some of which
challenge the notion of simple maintenance of traditional cultural identity. Papers will
explore such diversity by: expanding the range of archaeological questions asked about the
lives of recent immigrants beyond acculturation; highlighting how unique local
circumstances produced equally unique strategies for adapting to new socio-cultural
environments; and by comparing the lives of these immigrant groups with each other and
with their Anglo-American neighbors.
[28] SYMPOSIUM · INTERDISCIPLINARY ARCHAEOLOGY ON VIKING AGE ICELAND: THE MOSFELL
ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT
The Mosfell Archaeological Project (MAP) is comprised of a multidisciplinary, international
team of collaborative researchers dedicated to reconstructing daily life and environmental
change in a domestic setting in Viking Age Iceland. Located on a modern-day farmstead
east of Reykjavik, the project has primarily focused on the excavation and virtual
reconstruction of a longhouse and adjacent Christian church. Papers will cross a broad
range of disciplines, reporting on research relating to issues such as textual analogy, GIS
modeling, palaeoethnobotony, bioarchaeology, site preservation and soil micromorphology.
[29] SYMPOSIUM · ANALYTICAL APPROACHES TO PALAEOLITHIC TECHNOLOGIES
In the fortieth anniversary year of David Clarke's instrumental volume "Analytical
Archaeology", the central theme of this session is the analysis of Palaeolithic technologies,
whether this be metric in focus, statistical, experimental, based on reduction sequences,
cladistics, raw material properties, attribute analysis, etc. The session incorporates a broad
chronological and geographical range of Palaeolithic material from the Lower to Upper
Palaeolithic. However, in all cases, participants are encouraged to emphasise analysis of
lithic material and novel approaches used therein, rather than its mere description or
archaeological "philately".
[30] SYMPOSIUM · LANDSCAPES IN THE NORTHWOODS. CURRENT RESEARCH IN THE UPPER
PENINSULA OF MICHIGAN
Landscapes can either be viewed as reflecting interactions between human populations
and the natural environment or as cultural constructions of the surrounding world. The
archaeological record therefore does not only define usage of landscapes but also directs
us to the social relationships between groups interacting within these landscapes. By
focusing on a regional approach to the study of landscapes, this symposium attempts
through the presentation of current archaeological studies in the Upper Peninsula of
Michigan to provide a better understanding of the relationships between landscapes either
natural or constructed and various cultural groups occupying the Northwoods of the "U.P."
through time.

[32] SYMPOSIUM · LOS PRIMEROS MEXICANOS: OLD SITES, NEW SITES AND CURRENT
RESEARCH ON THE LATE PLEISTOCENE/EARLY HOLOCENE OCCUPATION OF MEXICO
Mexico’s geographical significance among the ongoing debates concerning the peopling of
the Americas has long been primarily considered as a vast corridor employed by the first
American groups in traveling to South America. Very little is known about the initial
inhabitants of Mexico, we know very little about the relationship with the extinct large
Pleistocene mammals, with the Paleoindian groups of North America and with the groups
of South America. The paucity of archaeological research on this topic that has been
conducted in Mexico is the principal limitation. The objective of this symposium is to
present the results of the ongoing investigations in both new and old sites, and to propose
an integral research program for the future.
[33] SYMPOSIUM · AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND SUBSISTENCE IN THE PACIFIC: RECENT
ANALYSES AND INVESTIGATIONS
Ranging from dryland sweet-potato cultivation to shellfish gathering, the ecology of Pacific
Islands has fostered the development of a variety of subsistence systems. This session
presents the results of recent quantitative analyses of food production and harvesting.
Investigators discuss methods that are relatively new to Pacific Island archaeology, such as
geobiochemical and isotopic analyses, and also elaborate upon recent studies that have
utilized more traditional methods such as survey, excavation, and GIS-based calculations.
Implications for prehistoric demography, social structure, innovation, and ecological change
on Pacific Islands are discussed.
[34] SYMPOSIUM · THE LEGACY OF CHARLES C. DI PESO: FIFTY YEARS AFTER THE JOINT
CASAS GRANDES PROJECT
(SPONSORED BY SAA BOARD OF DIRECTORS)
It has been 50 years since Charles C. Di Peso began his monumental excavations at
Paquimé (or Casas Grandes), located in northwest Chihuahua, Mexico. The work opened
vast new perspectives on the long-standing question of relations between Mesoamerica
and the Pueblo societies of the U.S. Southwest, and Di Peso's ideas continue to be
debated today. Each paper in this session takes a key Casas Grandes topic, reviews Di
Peso's original interpretation and discusses how it haves endured or been modified over
the last five decades. The session concludes with considerations from U.S. and Mexican
perspectives of Di Peso's enduring contributions.
[35] SYMPOSIUM · OXYGEN ISOTOPES AS TRACERS OF HUMAN MOBILITY
Climate, elevation, and other environmental factors affect the relative abundances of
oxygen isotopes such that their ratios vary geographically. Symposium participants will
address how the preservation of these ratios in tooth and bone might be used to determine
the geographic origins of humans and inform about patterns of human mobility in the past.
[36] SYMPOSIUM · THE ARCHAEOLOGY AND HISTORICAL ECOLOGY OF SEALS, SEA LIONS, AND
SEA OTTERS OF THE NORTH PACIFIC
Human use of coastal environments has a deep history, including some of the earliest
occupants of the Americas. For over 10,000 years, humans have relied on a diverse array
of aquatic resources with marine mammals representing the largest animals on the coast.
Archaeological and historical perspectives provide a unique lens for understanding how
people have hunted, scavenged, and impacted pinnipeds and sea otters over the long
term. This session brings together archaeologists, historians, ecologists, and other
scientists to understand how ancient perspectives can inform our understanding of marine
mammal biodiversity, conservation, management, and natural history.
[37] SYMPOSIUM · CULTURAL HERITAGE M ANAGEMENT IN LATIN         AMERICA: THE DEVELOPMENT
OF NEW ORGANIZATION STRATEGIES
The management of archaeological resources in Latin American countries has evolved
from scarce nationally sponsored projects to local community projects actively promoted by
local populations. The current trend is towards a management of archaeological resources
aimed at the development of resources of a region in the spirit of economic sustainability.
This session will explore several case studies that straddle the gap between independent
,   6                                     ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING
and successful locally-centered endeavours and the benefits to be obtained with integral
plans that are sponsored as part of sponsored as part of regional, sustainable development
projects.
[38] FORUM · MOTHERHOOD, INSTITUTIONAL CHANGE, AND THE FUTURE OF WOMEN IN
ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY WAIG- WOMEN IN ARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP)
Women have made great strides toward gender equity in archaeology, yet many still feel
challenged to complete graduate studies and tenure requirements during their reproductive
years. Our universities, contract companies, and professional organizations have been
slow to awaken to the realities of mothers as academic and professional archaeologists.
We have organized this forum to address motherhood as a matter of gender equity in
archaeology, contending that the perspectives of mothers are essential to well-rounded
archaeological interpretation. This forum brings together a panel of women that have
established, or are trying to establish, archaeological careers while also bearing and raising
children.
[39] SYMPOSIUM · THE LANDSCAPES OF LYDIA, WESTERN TURKEY: PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF
THE CENTRAL LYDIA ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY, 2005-2007
The Central Lydia Archaeological Survey aims to understand the approximately 350 square
kilometer area of diverse landscapes surrounding the Gygaean Lake (modern Marmara
Gölü) in western Turkey. Initiated in 2005, the project has employed a variety of
approaches with complementary paleoenvironmental and archaeological foci to reveal
evidence about the people and places of central Lydia from before the Early Bronze Age
through the early modern period. Extensive and intensive survey data, aerial and satellite
imagery, material analyses, paleoenvironmental reconstructions, GPS microtopography,
and geophysical prospection results are integrated within a landscape archaeological
framework to clarify long-term environmental and cultural dynamics.
[40] SYMPOSIUM · POSTCOLONIAL ARCHAEOLOGIES OF AFRICA
Archaeologists working in Africa struggle to realize a means of investigating the world that
is cognizant of but not paralyzed by past injustices. In this session we explore the diversity
of practices that inform archaeology in postcolonial Africa, creating opportunities to assess
the decolonization of practice and theory by undressing continuing masquerades of doing
archaeology and making history. Through case studies that amplify personal practice and
experience we navigate plays of power, "voices," and conflicting representations of pasts to
develop archaeological approaches that contribute to and valorize contemporary African
societies.
[41] SYMPOSIUM · MANIOC, M AIZE, AND M AYA SUBSISTENCE: NEW DISCOVERIES AT CEREN, EL
SALVADOR
Recent geophysical and archaeological research at Ceren focused on agriculture. The
hypothesis that productive intensity would decrease with distance from the village was
rejected. Intensive maize “high performance milpa” agriculture continued south of the
village. The principal discovery was a manioc field that had largely been harvested and had
been replanted just before the Loma Caldera eruption. Replanting was by placing the large
stocks horizontally in the planting beds. Manioc productivity in calories per unit area
probably was greater than any other cultigen. Manioc’s minimal edaphic requirements
suggest it may have been more widely cultivated than previously believed.

sedentism. This poster session explores recent research on Mogollon Rim pithouse sites to
discuss settlement stability and mobility strategies, regional ethnic interactions, and
technological choices associated with emerging ceramic traditions. This session includes
experimental analyses of raw materials for ceramic production, analyses and comparisons
of recently collected ceramics and lithics with archived collections, and architectural and
geoarchaeological analysis of recently excavated pithouses.

LOWER FRASER RIVER W ATERSHED, SW BRITISH COLUMBIA
The Coast Salish communities of SW British Columbia are linked through a complex
network of social relations, identities, and landscapes. This is especially so for groups living
on the extraordinarily resource-rich Fraser River and its tributaries. Major communication
and transportation routes along these rivers supported diverse social interactions and
identity-forming relations within and between watersheds. In this session, we bring together
a decade of archaeological, oral historical, and linguistic research among the Sto:lo-Coast
Salish. This research demonstrates a dynamic interplay of social, economic, and
environmental relations supporting a long-term continuum of interaction and identity
formation.
[53] SYMPOSIUM · THE ORGANIZATION OF CORE TECHNOLOGIES: NEW PERSPECTIVES
Published in 1987, "The Organization of Core Technology" examined bifacial, blade and
expedient core technologies in relation to prehistoric settlement patterns and land use,
subsistence strategies, raw material procurement, and craft specialization. This same
volume also foreshadowed the development of several explanatory models of human
behavior often cited by archaeologists such as raw material quality and availability,
technological flexibility and reliability, and toolkit efficiency. As we move into the 21st
century, we seek to examine whether our approaches to the study of core technology and
the ways we explain behavioral variability have changed in the last 20 years.
[54] SYMPOSIUM · GEOPHYSICAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT WORLD HERITAGE SITES
World Heritage Sites, as designated by UNESCO, contain particularly important
archaeological remains that have a broad appeal world-wide. As these sites are often very
visible to the general public, they generate particular challenges in interpretation,
preservation and often even national identities. Geophysical archaeological analysis can
often aid in these endeavors by mapping otherwise invisible cultural remains preserved
below ground. Placing these important sites into their environmental context using
geophysics helps in an overall interpretation, defines areas that should be preserved, and
allows for a more holistic analysis of past cultures. New tools for archaeological mapping
will be presented at a number of these sites using a variety of near-surface geophysical
methods.

STONEHENGE LANDSCAPE
The Stonehenge Riverside Project is a joint initiative by five British universities which seeks
to illuminate Stonehenge and its World Heritage landscape using recent conceptual and
methodological developments. Fieldwork over five years has concentrated on the
materiality of monuments, experiential aspects of landscape, structured deposition of
materials, and the use of new archaeological technologies. This session will present the
results of survey and excavation, including extensive work at the henge, avenue and
settlement complex and Durrington Walls, and will provide the opportunity for a discussion
with Americanist archaeologists on the investigation of monumental landscapes.
[56] SYMPOSIUM · THE RELEVANCE OF AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY: INTELLECTUAL AND
PRACTICE-BASED CONTRIBUTIONS OF JEREMY A. SABLOFF
The career of Jeremy Sabloff, including innovative field research in the Maya region,
synthesis of the history of archaeology and its place in the modern world, and his service to
the professional and public sectors, is honored in this session. Colleagues discuss his
contributions to the field on such topics as ancient urbanism, Maya studies, societal
transformations, political advocacy, public outreach, and writing for a popular audience. His
enduring concern for the relevance of the past to the present has never been more
important as archaeology intersects with public education, museums and research, and
indigenous communities.
[57] SYMPOSIUM · MIDDLE HOLOCENE BEHAVIORAL STRATEGIES IN THE AMERICAS
(SPONSORED BY INQUA COMMISSION ON PALAEOECOLOGY AND HUMAN EVOLUTION)
The middle Holocene has been characterized as a generally more arid and, at times, highly
climatically variable period in prehistory in a number of regions worldwide. Human
responses to middle Holocene climatic phenomena are equally varied in their expression
and it is this variability that makes the period so potentially informative. While many
interpretations of middle Holocene behavior have been developed, a more comprehensive
understanding of human behavioral strategies may be achieved through a multinational
discussion of the topic, considering a broader set of parameters, perhaps not visible at the
local level.
[58] SYMPOSIUM · THE RISE OF HIERARCHICAL POLITIES IN THE NORTHERN TITICACA BASIN:
RECENT RESEARCH, NEW THEORIES
While the northern half of the Lake Titicaca Basin in the south-central Andes highlands of
Peru has long been known as the home of the Pukara polity - a complex chiefdom,
precursor to the Tiwanaku state - investigation of the development of ranked society here is
still in its infancy. Following recently increasing political stability and thus the ability to
conduct archaeological research, Programa Collasuyu members have initiated a number of
projects, contributing new data on the archaeological cultures of the northern basin that
significantly challenge previous understanding of the processes by which increasing socio-
political complexity occurred here.
[59] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY WITHOUT BORDERS: RE-EVALUATING THE
MESOAMERICAN/CHIBCHAN INTERFACE
The definition of the southern frontier of Mesoamerica has long been a fundamental
research problem for archaeologists, and one that has never found a satisfying answer.
Recently, the recognition of a Chibchan culture area in Lower Central America has
generated exciting new interpretations of that region. This symposium proposes to bring
together scholars working in Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica and Panama to
discuss recent research and its impact on the question of cultural boundaries. While
specific case studies will comprise an important component of the data presented,
participants are encouraged to think outside of the box/site to try to integrate a broader
perspective.

the 1980s, paleoenvironmental reconstruction and methodological and theoretical
approaches towards linking prehistory and past environments have advanced considerably.
Our ability to describe and explain the human history of this region is dependent upon
acquiring and using paleoenvironmental data to reconstruct past landscapes and habitats.
The papers in this symposium explore data, method, and theory that contribute to a
reassessment of region's prehistory with a focus on the dynamic relationships between
humans and the shorelines, rivers, and watersheds in which they lived.

[62] SYMPOSIUM · THE EARLIEST ATHAPASKANS IN SOUTHERN SOUTHWEST: IMPLICATIONS FOR
MIGRATION
Archaeological, linguistic, and ethnographic data suggest that proto-Navajo and proto-
Apachean groups were in the southern Southwest at least two hundred or more years
before the first Spanish contact in 1540. Early evidence comes from the mountains, the
front range of the Rockies, and the plains. Similarities in this earliest pre-differentiation suite
of material culture traits throughout this area suggest connections are traceable to the
northern homeland. Research is focused on documenting the nature, distribution, and
timing of this early Athapaskan presence and attempting to trace the origin back to Canada
from the south up, and from the north down.

This session is a review of current archaeology ongoing in the Bahama Archipelago. It
includes topics ranging from Bioarchaeology, Lucayan Archaeology, Colonial Archaeology,
and Cultural Resources Management.
[64] SYMPOSIUM · THE MIDDLE ASIAN INTERACTION SPHERE
The Middle Asian Interaction Sphere" is a term used to describe the cultural, political and
commercial relationships of the various ancient cultures between Mesopotamia and the
Indus, Central Asia and the Arabian Peninsula as far back as the fourth millennium. Over
the years, archaeological and literary evidence of mercantile networks, both overland and
maritime, and the sharing of styles over great distances, has suggested the need to
reconfigure our understanding of these relationships and peoples. This panel discussion is
a forum for shared analysis of the MAIS's complex dynamics and developments.
[65] SYMPOSIUM · INTERNATIONAL CURATION STANDARDS: WHAT'S WORKING, WHAT'S NOT
(SPONSORED BY THE SAA CURATION COMMITTEE)
The need to ensure that archaeological collections and archives are accessible and useful
resources is an important priority for archaeologists internationally. In the digital age many
institutions are finding innovative ways to share the results of archaeology. Sometimes
forward-thinking initiatives are hampered by a lack of basic infrastructure to support access
to artifacts and information. There are also problems which relate to deposition such as the
scale of the physical archive generated by fieldwork, including use, storage, access,
discard and curation. This session will provide examples of current issues as well as those
of good practice from both the Americas and Europe.

This panel explores the materiality of the first European settlements in North America
through architecture, material culture, theory and environmental data. Early European
settlers brought traditions and material culture from their places of origin, but new
circumstances required them to adapt their use of old resources and develop new ones.

visible archaeologically in technologies, foodstuffs, architecture, and decorative artifacts.
Scholars on this panel will explore early settlers' consciousness of the world through
multicultural objects and spaces.
[69] SYMPOSIUM · SPECIALIZATION, INTENSIFICATION AND DIVERSIFICATION IN ANIMAL
EXPLOITATION STRATEGIES DURING THE LATE PLEISTOCENE IN THE MEDITERRANEAN BASIN
Accumulating evidence points to the emergence of new foraging strategies across the
Mediterranean Basin and adjacent areas at the end of the Pleistocene. These strategies
include specialized exploitation of high-ranked taxa, intensive processing of ungulate
carcasses for products including marrow and bone grease, and the diversification of human
diets to include low-ranked taxa such as juveniles and small-bodied, difficult-to-capture
prey. The purpose of the session is to obtain a more comprehensive picture of the nature of
Late Pleistocene forager adaptations, in particular their variability and the timing of their
emergence in different ecological niches around the Mediterranean Basin.
[70] SYMPOSIUM · FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY: PAST, PRESENT, & FUTURE
"Forensic Archaeology" as a coined term is a relatively new addition to the many sub-
disciplines of archaeology. Despite the newness of the field, archaeologists have aided law
enforcement for decades. However, in the past 25 years, forensic archaeology has
developed into a more formal discipline. At times the police still seek out archaeologists but
more and more, the request is for a "forensic archaeologist." This session aims to explore
forensic archaeology from its humble origins, through to its current state, and questions
where it will be headed in the future.
[71] SYMPOSIUM · RECENT ADVANCES IN ROCK ART RESEARCH
(SPONSORED BY ROCK ART INTEREST GROUP)
The symposium is intended to provide a framework within which recent rock art research
can be shared without regard to geographic or temporal restraint. The session is sponsored
by the SAA's Rock Art Interest Group.
[72] SYMPOSIUM · INSIDE-OUT: THE ROLE OF CONTINGENCY AND EXPERIENCE IN 'DOMESTIC'
CONSTRUCTION
Much of what is meant by the term domestic follows the human ability to make the world fit
and tractable for consumption. But to what extent is this merely a contradistinction - a
product of modern (Cartesian) thought? Can it more accurately be said, following the work
of Tim Ingold, that the domestic arises from the relational and practical engagements of
people with their surroundings? In what ways do built forms provide a constitutive and
performative domain for being alongside their more metered response to environmental
conditions? How can we imagine past settings beyond the constraints of our own built
forms?
[73] SYMPOSIUM · INTERACTION AND SOCIETY: PERSPECTIVES ON COAST-HIGHLAND
RELATIONSHIPS IN THE ANDES
This symposium considers interregional interactions on the western slopes of the Andes
and their impact on local cultural developments and trajectories. Interaction refers to a wide
range of practices, such as warfare, trade, stylistic interchange, politics, and so on that are
fundamental to social complexity. In the Andes, the relationships between the Pacific coast
and the highland regions were particularly critical due to unique contrasts in environment
zones, terrains and resources. Zones were exploited and often contested, and shifts in
interaction had repercussions on patterns of material culture and social organization. The
session aims at assessing the forms, contents and meanings associated with coast-
highland interaction and its implications for Andean social complexity. A range of material
correlates and time periods in current research will be treated, so that long-term patterns
and transformations can be compared and elucidated.

rich repository of information that can be revealed through specific analyzes and by diverse
scientific disciplines. We will discuss an array of topics from specific archaeological objects
produced in Mexico; dealing with the identification of their constituent elements/raw
materials, their chemical composition, their sources of origin, the possible forms in that the
raw materials were obtained (trade, exchange and tribute), the effort involved in their
acquisition and transformation, and the manufacturing techniques. Finally symbolic and
iconographic aspects and some conservation treatments will be approached.
[75] SYMPOSIUM · HOMININ BEHAVIORAL VARIATION DURING THE PLEISTOCENE AND EARLY
HOLOCENE IN EAST ASIA AND AUSTRALASIA
Eastern Old World Pleistocene and Early Holocene hominin behavior was different in many
ways from the West. The primary goal of this symposium is to present a series of papers
from leading authorities that synthesizes the current state of evidence of hominin
behavioral variation in East Asia and Australasia during the Pleistocene and into the Early
Holocene. Papers will include discussion of early hominin migration routes in East Asia,
analyses of stone toolkits, vertebrate taphonomic investigations, and megafaunal
extinctions in Australasia. These papers will facilitate a more comprehensive understanding
of Pleistocene and Early Holocene hominin behavior in East Asia and Australasia.
[76] SYMPOSIUM · AUTHORITY AND THE PROCESS OF POWER: THE VIEW FROM AFRICAN
ARCHAEOLOGY
The papers in this session examine aspects of power in the archaeology of the African
past. Archaeological examinations of power on the continent have often focused on the
negotiation of authority and the ongoing processes of legitimation performed by individuals
and groups. We extend these insights by examining the relationship between power and
authority. Authority, we argue, is continuously created and reaffirmed through instantiated
acts, which can form the subject matter of archaeological inquiry. Individual papers will
examine forms of cultural production that are involved in the translation of power into
authority, such as landscapes, material culture and imperial practices.
[77] SYMPOSIUM · IDENTIDADES Y CULTURA MATERIAL EN MESOAMÉRICA
El objetivo particular es mostrar la importancia que ha adquirido recientemente, en la
interpretación antropológica-arqueológica, la reconstrucción de las identidades, a través
del estudio de la cultura material, en contextos prehistóricos, históricos y contemporáneos.
Especialmente nos interesa mostrar cómo la vida social está marcada por experiencias
individuales y sociales de corporalidad, género y etnicidad y cómo se manifiestan estos
aspectos a través de la cultura material de distintos pueblos del área mesoamericana.
También se les invita a discutir las contribuciones de la antropología al debate posmoderno
con respecto a la teoría y la actitud autoreflexiva sobre la identidad y señalar el papel que
juega la arqueología en la construcción de otros grupos, es decir, observar de qué manera
conceptos como etnicidad, género e identidad grupal han sido empleados para el estudio
de la alteridad en sociedades y culturas de Mesoamérica.
[78] FORUM · DIGITAL ANTIQUITY: PLANNING AN INFORMATION INFRASTRUCTURE FOR
ARCHAEOLOGY
(SPONSORED BY SAA BOARD OF DIRECTORS)
The utility of archaeological data is severely diminished by its inaccessibility. Archaeology
needs to take transformative steps to develop an information infrastructure that can provide
Internet access to archaeological research documents, databases, and images. This
infrastructure will require software development, a management structure and financial
model, and real commitment by practicing archaeologists. Archaeoinformatics.org has been
funded to develop a plan for such an information infrastructure. This forum offers an
opportunity for discussion of the desirable capabilities of the infrastructure, how it should be
managed and funded, and how the discipline can best be engaged in its development and
use.

early 1990s with the demonstration that much of what is recorded in mythological texts
concerns events featured in the nighttime sky on certain key dates. This symposium
focuses on recent research aimed at documenting celestial references in prehispanic
hieroglyphic and Colonial Maya texts concerned with creation, as well as on critiquing the
methodology employed in this endeavor. Specifically, we address the issue of how to make
meaningful synchronic and diachronic connections between different Mesoamerican myths
in a methodologically defensible way.
[80] SYMPOSIUM · THE LATE ARCHAIC IN THE FAR SOUTHWEST: NEW DATA AND NEW
INTERPRETATIONS
The time between 2150 and 900 BP in southern California, Arizona, and Nevada
represents one of the most significant culture changes in western North America. This
period, usually referred to as the Late Archaic or Preceramic, is marked by the shift from
spearthrower to bow and arrow technologies, preliminary uses of ceramics, and a
hypothetical influx of Numic speakers into the region. Research over the last 20 years,
largely conducted by CRM firms and government institutions, has produced a substantial
amount of data. The present session aims to discuss and synthesize these data, offering a
revised prehistory of the region.

CEMETERY
An overlooked and largely untold part of Los Angeles' beginning is the story of City
Cemetery. The cemetery was officially moved in the early 20th century. However, recent
excavations exposed remnants of 173 burial features, many containing human remains.
Research has focused on determining the identities of the remains through a combination
of archival research, artifact analysis, osteological studies, and GIS technology. The
research provides a better understanding of the role of City Cemetery in mid to late 19th-
century Los Angeles, Victorian-era mortuary practices on the West Coast, and patterns of
health and socioeconomic status within the cemetery population.

Burial disturbances represent one of the most problematic aspects of mortuary
archaeology. Looting, complex mortuary practices, and natural disturbances may be
perceived as a limiting factor for archaeological interpretation. Disturbances, however, offer
a unique chance to study the attitudes towards the dead. This symposium will bring
together specialists on mortuary archaeology and bioarchaeology to discuss looting in
stateless societies. The papers will attempt to clearly define looting, suggest the effective
ways to identify it in the mortuary archaeological record, and discuss the significance of
looting for understanding the attitudes towards the dead.

Stone tool technology is one of the most durable and studied materials reflecting prehistoric
human culture. Moreover, issues related to lithic morphology have been key in
archaeological discussions since the early 20th Century. This topic continues to intrigue
archaeologists in part due to its capacity to bypass analytically imposed categories, but
also because morphology and morphological dynamics are inherent traits that can
potentially elucidate cultural variation and track long term cultural change. This symposium
embraces a wide range of analytical techniques geared towards furthering the
archaeological understanding of lithic morphology. The similarly broad geographic foci are
reflective of the global importance and potential of lithic morphology studies to enhance
archaeological understanding of prehistoric cultural variability.
[96] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM · MODELLING EARLY METALLURGY: OLD AND NEW WORLD
PERSPECTIVES
Despite decades of scholarly research on ancient metal technology, we still lack suitable
models to place the earliest use and production of metals into their socio-cultural contexts.
In this session, sixteen papers by current scholars on the early adoption of metals and
metallurgy over five continents will be discussed. Although these case studies are entirely
different in terms of their technological backgrounds, cultural contexts, and societal
organization, they provide contrasting examples of how human societies can adopt and
adapt to new technologies and materials.

[98] SYMPOSIUM · INTERACTION, INNOVATION AND SOCIAL CHANGE: THE PARACAS-NASCA
TRANSITION
The south Central Andean coast hosted development of methods for the study of artifact
style, temporal sequence and regional differentiation. However, the time-space grid has not
fostered studies of social organization, regional integration and historic process. Poised
between master sequences and including the late Paracas, Topara and early Nazca artifact
traditions, nonetheless this period demonstrates continuities in site occupation. Habitation
and mortuary assemblages provide evidence of exchange among diverse populations,
long-distance resource procurement, innovations in artifact technology and style, and
sociopolitical change. We propose strategies drawing on archaeological data to address
social relations, practices and processes in this "transitional" period.

[100] SYMPOSIUM · NICHE CONSTRUCTION THEORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY
Niche construction theory (NCT) is a recent development in evolutionary biology referring to
the evolutionary process whereby an organism modifies its environment in potentially
advantageous ways. Moving beyond traditional evolutionary theory, NCT shows how
organisms actively shape their environments, highlighting a third dimension of evolutionary
inheritance. NCT is gaining acceptance in mainstream evolutionary biology and has
recently been incorporated in debates about hominin evolution. The archaeological record
provides the temporal depth necessary to document instances of human niche construction
generally unavailable to other disciplines. This session brings together archaeological case
studies from various geographical and temporal contexts rooted in NCT.

zones, where many models for increasing specialization have originated. Here, species
distribution is often patchy and abundant resources may be available on a strictly seasonal
basis. Responses to episodes of environmental stress, sedentism, demographic growth or
even climatic amelioration, are more immediate, while the utilization of prime resources is
more intense. Studying the nature of specialization in "marginal" settings allows for a
clearer understanding of changing human adaptation in arid environments and draws
attention to similarities in the types of resources most abundant and/or reliable under
varying conditions.
[102] SYMPOSIUM · ENVISIONING THE CAVESCAPE: CURRENT RESEARCH ON THE MULTIFACETED
ASPECTS OF CAVE UTILIZATION BY ANCIENT MAYA PEOPLE
Over the last century, archaeological, ethnographic, and epigraphic studies have provided
evidence for the ancient use of caves in the Maya area. Early investigations evinced some
utilitarian functions but overwhelmingly ritual use of caves, while recent studies have begun
to focus on the distinct types of activities and performances that took place in the
subterranean realm. The papers in this symposium represent further scrutiny of the
differential use of spaces within individual caves and across regions. These efforts
collectively embody an inquiry into the multifaceted nature of "Cavescapes", an integral part
of ancient Maya religion and sacred landscape.
[103] FORUM · RAISING THE PROFILE: INCREASING PROTECTION FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL

(SPONSORED BY SAA GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE)
Much of the nation's archaeological heritage lies outside the scope of federal or state
jurisdiction and is therefore not covered by existing preservation law. In increasing
numbers, local governments are addressing this deficiency by adopting policies and
passing preservation ordinances that require consideration of impacts to archaeological
sites as part of development review and approval. The Government Affairs Committee will
host a forum to discuss the growing need for effective ways of promoting and strengthening
local protections for archaeological resources.

Yucatan, Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, and Honduras. These include soil studies of
wetland and upland agriculture, soil chemical prospection around sites, sediment cores,
evidence for soil erosion and sedimentation, and the interactions of soil, plant, and water
chemistry. Techniques range from traditional excavation, analyses of artifacts and ecofacts,
and dating to a range of emerging chemical procedures.

plant exploitation strategies are still debated. During this session we would like to explore
the various types of archeological evidence for plant exploitation available for the Natufians,
considering both direct (e.g. phytolith, macro-remains) and indirect (e.g. lithic and bone
tools, analysis of human remains) evidence. Our objective is to discuss the various data
sets, methods, and interpretations in order to shed more light on Natufian plant
management strategies.

Research into the timing, nature and extent of coastal resource exploitation in the Early-Mid
Holocene is expanding due to a combination of new theoretical and methodological
advances. Theoretically, consideration is again being given to coastal routes of colonisation
of new lands, while later ethnographic accounts emphasise the greater sociocultural
complexity often attained by coastal groups. Methodologically, the difficulties presented by
the loss of much of the coastline as a result of rising sea levels have been partially
overcome by the combination of radiocarbon and stable isotope analyses of human
remains. This session explore new advances in this area from a world-wide perspective.

CULTURE
As a wide spread phenomenon in coastal areas on both sides of the Atlantic, shell middens
are an important source of information on sedentary or semi-sedentary hunter-gatherers-
fishers. Shell middens and "sambaquis" are cultural structures produced by remnants of
biological entities, and as such they should be amenable to biological analyses aimed at
discerning cultural phenomena. Some bioarchaeological questions we would like to explore
are: environmental impact on cultural phenomena; cultural sanction of biological
assortments; buried bodies as expressions of material culture, and many more specific
ones that arise from individual archaeological experiences of zooarchaeologist, human
osteologists and paleoethnobotanist working on shell middens on both sides of the Atlantic.

PERSPECTIVES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN COMPLEXITY
Although archaeology is a relatively young discipline in Southeast Asia, recent research
has revealed robust evidence concerning the development of agricultural societies and

from individual sites, often emphasizing the most recent excavation. Understanding
regional development and cultural variability has been downplayed. Incorporation of
historical ecology and the landscape approach into interpretations of agricultural and social
development will facilitate examination of the interplay of human societies with their social

evidence for the contact era. This symposium presents archaeological studies of contact
era dynamics within and between Native, European, and Euroamerican communities in the

Euroamerican trade in Native society and economy, the effects of contact on Native
household organization, and socioeconomic organization within the fur trade community.

Dryas played out in their specific region. However, there has not been a broad-based effort
to examine the effects of the Younger Dryas in different regions and how (or whether) late-
Pleistocene hunter-gatherers responded to these changes. Such an effort is the goal of this
symposium, and will show the variety of late-Pleistocene hunter-gatherer responses to
differing climatic and environmental changes that can be compared, contrasted, and
analyzed for underlying patterns.

the central sierra. Our understanding of the nature of this expansion has been based
largely on the results of investigations in and around a handful of settlements that have
been conceived of as Wari administrative centers. In this session, participants move

[148] SYMPOSIUM · THE EMERGENCE OF HUNTER-GATHERER COMPLEXITY IN SOUTH FLORIDA
At contact, south Florida was dominated by powerful, nonagricultural, tribute-based polities
like the Calusa that rivaled Mississippian chiefdoms in their complexity and longevity.
Beginning 5,000 years earlier, coastal foragers established complex political hierarchies
and engineered an unparalleled landscape of massive earth and shell work complexes,

[149] SYMPOSIUM · NEW VIEWS ON ANCIENT AFRICA-PAPERS IN HONOR OF C. GARTH
SAMPSON
Garth Sampson continues to apply his curious mind to archaeological problems in diverse
locations around the world. The roots of that curiosity and its most frequent application are
in his African home. From his undergraduate days in Cape Town to Cambridge, Oxford,
Oregon and SMU, the pattern of questioning, fieldwork, and publication was firmly
established and the breadth of African archaeology is the better for it. On the occasion of
his "retirement" from SMU his students, colleagues, and friends honor him with a set of
papers that explore diverse African archaeological topics.
[150] SYMPOSIUM · SOME ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHIMERAS IN THE INVESTIGATIONS OF ANCIENT
MEXICO
Mexican archaeology faces a series of dogmas inherited from the archaeologists who
preceded us, which, we have not been able or wanted to rectify. For example, Teotihuacan
was the mythical Tollan; later it was decided that Tula was the place. Other historical myth
is that Taj was built by the Totonacs, in both cases there is a great division among
specialists. Almost each researcher maintains some discord, if not a rebuttal, with respect
to some subject within its area of specialization. In the symposium we set out to express,
examine and in its case amend some of these chimeras.
[151] FORUM · HERITAGE VALUES AND VALUING HERITAGE: CONSIDERING THE (DIS)CONNECTS
AMONG THE PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE
(SPONSORED BY PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE)
How does contemporary society value the past? Can and, if so, how should such
valuations be defined, measured, and applied to public policy, management, spending,
training, and education? This session examines the practical concerns and theoretical
underpinnings central to our understanding of archaeological heritage. Dialogue explores
the ways in which heritage is constructed and construed and to what extent that
composition coheres with or contradicts value systems ingrained in diverse discourses,
such as national paradigms, international standards, management schemes, collective
memory, and shared or dissonant identities. The session therefore probes the derivation
and ascription of value.
[152] SYMPOSIUM · NEW DIRECTIONS IN COASTAL CALIFORNIA ARCHAEOLOGY
Archaeological research along the California coast has revealed the importance of this area
from the early Holocene through the Historic period. This session offers a range of
perspectives that examine issues integral to the development of maritime cultures along the
eastern Pacific shoreline. Past research in this geographic area has provided a baseline for
tracking general patterns of subsistence, settlement, and cultural change over the last
10,000 years. Current research is providing new data which requires refinement and
reevaluation of our current understanding of the history of the human occupation of coastal
California.
[153] SYMPOSIUM · THE PREHISTORY OF IBERIA (NEOLITHIC TO IRON          AGE) AND THE DEBATE ON
THE FORMATION OF HIERARCHICAL SOCIETIES AND THE STATE
One of the main ongoing debates in the history of Iberian Prehistory has been the formation
of the state. In this discussion, the definition of state and the social and historical processes
involved in its rise have been relevant, and have driven a large part of the empirical
research undertaken. In this symposium, the validity of this debate, as well as the avenues
that it opens for the future of the research, will be addressed through a series of case
studies from throughout the Iberian Peninsula.
[154] SYMPOSIUM · FROM THE PECOS TO THE PALEOLITHIC: PAPERS IN HONOR OF ARTHUR J.

,   20                                        ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING
influenced two generations of scholars. His recognition of the 'Frison effect' helped
establish the concept of lithic reduction and its interpretive implications for Pleistocene to
Holocene assemblages across North America, Europe, Africa, Australia, and Asia. He
established the importance of computerization with his work at Tabun (late 1960s and early
1970s), accurately gauging the future direction of excavation methodology. Beyond this, he
also worked with surface and pottery assemblages. This symposium features studies by
those whom Jelinek mentored, highlighting his contributions to archaeological method and
theory.
[155] SYMPOSIUM · (RE)CONSTRUCTING IDENTITY:         THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE PACIFIC COAST
AND HIGHLANDS OF CHIAPAS AND GUATEMALA
This session explores the methodological and theoretical challenges of understanding
identity though archaeological remains. The geographic focus is the Pacific Coast and
Highlands of Chiapas and Guatemala where from the Preclassic to the Postclassic
interactions between local communities and the Olmec, Teotihuacanos, and Aztec to name
only a few groups, have left a lasting mark on the archaeological record in these regions.
The situational and fluid nature of identity and the static nature of the archaeological record
continue to challenge archaeologists working in these regions in their efforts to
(re)construct ethnicity, gender, class, and other identities that cross cut these larger
categories.
[156] SYMPOSIUM · RECENT APPLICATIONS OF GEOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES IN POLYNESIAN
ARCHAEOLOGY
This session presents recent research applying geochemical techniques to archaeological
data recovered from Polynesia. The majority of this research has applied XRF to obsidian
and basalt material. However, other techniques have been employed to lithic and ceramic
artifacts. Further, as chemical characterization becomes more commonplace, we are
gaining a clearer understanding of which techniques are appropriate for which materials
and a clearer series of protocols for sample preparation and analysis. Regardless of the
specific technique or material, the application of geochemistry to archaeological research
problems has ultimately led to greater insights concerning the production and circulation of
goods in Polynesia.
[157] SYMPOSIUM · IDENTITY AND IDEOLOGY AT THE FRONTIER: PERSPECTIVES FROM
TARAPACA, NORTHERN CHILE
During the 1st millennium AD, the Tarapaca Valley was an important center for
contemporary nomadic groups. This valley was the focal point of the Pica-Tarapaca cultural
complex with the main site of Caserones serving as a major political and ideological center.
In 2005, the Tarapaca Valley Archaeological Project began a multi disciplinary research
project in the area. This session examines the results of this work and focuses on
archaeological evidence related to the rise and fall of the Pica-Tarapaca cultural complex,
the role of Caserones, its impact on the region and the complete rejection of Tiwanaku's
influence in the valley.
[158] SYMPOSIUM · HYDRAULIC CONSTRUCTIONS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXTS
Recent discoveries in the Americas have illustrated the diverse methods used by
preindustrial cultures to harvest, manage, and distribute water. While environmental
constraints determine the options available within specific regions, political organization,
subsistence patterns, and innovation determine which options were exercised. The array of
engineering feats has included methods for tapping aquifers, directing runoff, collecting
infiltration, wetland exploitation, and associated methods of storage and utilization of water
resources. Here we present a collection of papers that represent the vanguard of our
expanding knowledge of how cultures adapted to and manipulated their environments with
hydraulic constructions.
[159] SYMPOSIUM · SCARCITY'S APPRENTICE - RAW MATERIAL AVAILABILITY AND THE
TRANSMISSION OF SKILL IN PREHISTORIC LITHIC TECHNOLOGY
Skill transmission in lithic technology has so far been explored predominantly in flint-rich
regions. In flint scarce regions, very little research has been carried out. Thus, the following

questions are worth exploring: ? How did skill transmission take place in flint scarce
regions? ? Did the process of skill acquisition differ? ? Are differences in technological
traditions and the occurrence of local innovations a direct result of a modification of skill
transmission due to differential raw material availability? A comparison of the diversity of
skill acquisition will provide new insights into the social and technological organisation of
prehistoric/archaic societies.
[160] SYMPOSIUM · REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON EASTERN EUROPEAN TRANSITIONS
Eastern Europe in the Neolithic, Copper Age, and Bronze Age is ripe with instances of
change and cultural transitions, making it an ideal location to study economic changes,
shifts in settlement patterns, and population movements. Important considerations include
the development of widespread agriculture, new methods of animal exploitation, and trends
of nucleation and dispersal. The purpose of this symposium is to examine social, economic,
and technological change during this dynamic period of prehistory from the perspective of
current researchers working in Eastern Europe.

(SPONSORED BY COSWA)
The 2003 SAA Member Needs Assessment Survey included a series of questions
sponsored by COSWA, and responses suggested significant disparities in how women and
men perceived gender inequities in archaeology. The marked differences in how women
and men understand the archaeological workplace suggests that women entering into
archaeology need the council of other women, whose experiences of being archaeologists
will mirror more closely their own future careers. This workshop is designed to bring women
together at various stages in their careers and in various types of employment to discuss
mentoring in both experience and practice.

High quality archaeology = logical theoretical underpinnings + solid methodology + careful
fieldwork / strong ethics x family support. This is the equation that describes R. G. Matson's
career. This session offers a series of papers dedicated to subjects within the two principal
geographic areas within which R. G. practises his craft: the American Southwest and the
Canadian Northwest. These state-of-the-art contributions concern a variety of topics that
have benefited from R. G. Matson's research and writing, clearly demonstrating the
importance of his critical thinking to North American archaeology.
[176] GENERAL SESSION · MORTUARY PATTERNS IN THE OLD WORLD
[177] SYMPOSIUM · BEYOND STATUS, MEANING, METAPHOR, AND IDENTITY IN NEW WORLD
MORTUARY PRACTICES
For decades archaeologists have recognized the enormous information potential of
mortuary practices and bioarchaeological data to inform on past peoples and lifeways. Most
studies have been carried out under a processual paradigm using mortuary practices to
examine social status, wealth, and prestige. As one aspect of the ritual sphere, however,
mortuary practices are a rich source of information of ideology and belief systems. When
combined with bioarchaeological data, mortuary practices also produce a vibrant
perspective on identity. This symposium explores meaning, metaphor, and identity in
mortuary practices in a variety of contexts in the New World.
[178] SYMPOSIUM · RETHINKING CLASS AND STATUS IN THE ANDES
In this symposium, we present empirical data from the prehispanic Andes in order to
discuss how archaeological accounts of pre-capitalist, non-market societies may challenge
and contribute to anthropological conceptualizations of class and status. Papers will move
beyond overly rigid Marxian notions of elite/commoner binary class relations by examining
the dynamic processes and mechanisms through which different social distinctions were
produced, reproduced, materialized, and naturalized in pre-capitalist settings. In this way,
the symposium adds to particular accounts of class and status in the Andes, as well as
general anthropological theories of political subjectivity, identity, social difference and
distinction.
[179] SYMPOSIUM · THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF INTOXICATION
The use of intoxicating substances is a human universal. While there is a substantial body
of ethnological research on intoxication, there has been relatively little research on the topic
by archaeologists. This symposium presents research into the archaeological correlates of
the use of intoxicants from a variety of geographic regions and time periods. In addition to
the identification of the specific intoxicants used, researchers have focused on the cultural
contexts in which they are employed, with specific attention given to ritual practices.

in the discovery of a sacrificial grave (Burial 6) that consisted of twelve people, abundant
predatory animals, and exceptionally rich offerings. Other major discoveries include seven
overlapping architectural stages of monumental construction, four other sacrificial burial
complexes, abundant symbolically charged artifacts, and the documentation of repeated

exploration of Burial 6, material analyses, contextual interpretations regarding the
symbolism of the monument, results of a three-dimensional architectural mapping project,
and new perspectives on Teotihuacano politico-religious power.
[181] SYMPOSIUM · SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT ON THE EARLY M AYA OF CENTRAL BELIZE
Archaeological investigations at Cahal Pech recorded important evidence for early (Cunil
phase (1000-800 BC) settlements in the Maya lowlands. Subsequent investigations at
Blackman Eddy and Xunantunich produced comparatively similar remains, confirming the
precocity of this early cultural tradition in the Belize Valley. In recent years contradictory
interpretations of the Cunil data (especially regarding the definition and interpretation of
ceramic types) have led to concerns for the accurate interpretation of early Belizean
prehistory. In an effort to set the record straight, this symposium will combine old and
recently recovered data to define the nature of Formative period culture in Central Belize.
[182] SYMPOSIUM · TOWARDS AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE AFRICAN DIASPORA —PAPERS IN
HONOR OF MERRICK POSNANSKY
(SPONSORED BY SOCIETY FOR AFRICANIST ARCHAEOLOGY)
Nearly twenty five years ago Merrick Posnansky published "Toward an Archaeology of the
Black Diaspora," a call to develop a sophisticated, multi-sited interdisciplinary
archaeological approach to understanding the diversity of the African Diaspora. Posnansky
argued that archaeological research would have to be undertaken at a wide range of sites
in the Americas and in Africa. Since that time, many have followed his call, undertakening
archaeological research on African Diaspora related sites in the United States, the
Caribbean, and West Africa and are brought together in this session to bear witness to over
20 years of African Diaspora archaeology.
[183] SYMPOSIUM · WEB 2.0 AND BEYOND: NEW TOOLS FOR COLLABORATION AND
COMMUNICATION
(SPONSORED BY THE ALEXANDRIA ARCHIVE INSTITUTE)
New technologies are transforming the way archaeologists communicate and explore the
past. Many archaeologists have embraced Web 2.0 collaborative tools and services such
as blogs, wikis and Flickr. Some are experimenting with web services to integrate different
bodies of content, interfaces and tools. These new tools present opportunities for research
and public participation in archaeology. This session aims to: - Highlight current
archaeological efforts implementing Web 2.0 technologies - Explore why certain
approaches seem to work best for communicating archaeology - Discuss the challenges of
networking archaeological information (semantic, intellectual property, technical, social)
and how to look beyond Web 2.0 in our discipline.
[184] SYMPOSIUM · PALEOINDIAN RESEARCH FRONTIERS IN NORTH AMERICA'S PLAINS AND
WESTERN MOUNTAINS
Eight decades have passed since New Mexico Folsom site excavations established
Paleoindian occupations of North American late Pleistocene and early Holocene
landscapes. Recently, Paleoindian research has accelerated with significant new site
discoveries, theoretical insights, and technological advances providing increasingly fine-
grained evidence on Paleoindian landscape elements, climates, ecosystems, and techno-
cultural adaptations. This symposium explores microstratigraphic, paleoclimatic, and
sedimentary analysis used in reconstruction of past climate and ecological systems,
chemical, physical, and typological tool analyses, and applications of Geographic
Information System software in simulating Clovis projectile point distributions and
Paleoindian settlement patterns.

The last two decades have realized an increase in archaeological investigations of
Northwest Mexico encompassing territory including Sonora, Chihuahua, Durango, Sinaloa,
and Nayarit, regions that historically have received far less attention by scholars than
Mesoamerica proper and the American Southwest. This symposium offers an opportunity
for archaeologists from Mexico and the United States to present their latest research
findings in a forum that emphasizes both a pan-regional and a local approach to the cultural

focused upon archaeology, iconography and art history, ethnography and ethnohistory,
bioarchaeology, and architecture.
[186] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGY OF MESOLITHIC EUROPE: RECENT ADVANCES
The European Mesolithic period, extending from approximately 10,000 years ago until the
arrival of farmers and the Neolithic, witnesses substantial variability in hunter-gatherer
adaptations across the continent. Focus is on coastal. lacustrine, and riverine adaptations;
inland occupation is generally rare and ephemeral. Many new discoveries point to a region
of both dynamic archaeology and extraordinary diversity. Evidence for sedentism, dietary
differences, burial and ritual, and the transition to agriculture will be considered in this
review. Information from Ireland, the UK, Norway, Denmark, Germany, Portugal, and
Serbia will be presented.

[188] SYMPOSIUM · JAPAN AND NW COAST (U.S./CAN) WET SITE CONNECTIONS: COMPARING
BASKETRY, MACRO-FLORA/FAUNA, WOODWORKING, NON-PERISHABLES
Perishable artifacts from North Pacific Rim waterlogged/wet sites provide a new dimension
to ancient material culture and plant food resource studies. Complex wood and fiber
artifacts are common in wet sites along the North Pacific. Basketry styles are sensitive to
ethnicity. Plant food resources such as acorns, hazelnuts and chestnuts are shown to be
important to the Jomon and Central Northwest Coast peoples. Use of wood products are
also crucial for over 9,000 years around the Rim. Wet sites reveal cultural patterns never
before visible with typical Pacific shell midden sites. Comparing trends between ancient
Japan and the Northwest Coast of North America are interesting when you have the
preservation of the ancient wood and fiber artifacts from the two sides of the North Pacific
Coast.
[189] SYMPOSIUM · CHAÎNE OPÉRATOIRE AND TRACÉOLOGIE: EXAMPLES OF INTEGRATED
RESEARCH APPROACHES FROM NORTH AMERICA
The theory and methodology of chaîne opératoire (roughly equivalent to reduction
sequences) and tracéologie (high-power use-wear analysis) as developed in France are
increasingly being applied to North American archaeological contexts. This symposium
brings together several ongoing research projects that apply the concepts of chaîne
opératoire and tracéologie to prehistoric sites from the Canadian Arctic to the US
Southwest. Research results from the application of these methodologies to various
technologies are presented. Problems and prospects in the integrated application of the
theory and methods of these two approaches to problem-oriented anthropological
archaeology are discussed.

Recent archaeology in the former USSR, Mongolia, Africa, South America, and elsewhere
is currently shaking our understanding of the prehistory of nomadic societies, as new
discoveries concerning prehistoric pastoralist communities offer a wider and more diverse
perspective of their strategies and impact on regional political economic histories. The aim
of the session is to bring new studies to the fore, and contextualize them within a regionally
comparative, theoretical framework. The themes of the session include: 1) domestication
and the emergence of pastoralist communities; 2) the socio-economic organization of
pastoralist communities; and 3) local-regional interaction and the formation of pastoralist
landscapes.

Despite an association that spans decades, evolutionary paradigms continue to inform
archaeological research and generate meaningful new questions. Recent research in
archaeology has expanded the range of inquiry to include questions about how social and
political agendas influence the archaeological record. Even traditional archaeological
applications focusing on economic pursuits have been modified to address a wider range of
questions about human behavior and the evolution of culture. Papers in the session reflect
recent trajectories in evolutionary research and emphasize a variety of methods of querying

The northern Gulf of Alaska is the Holocene homeland of complex maritime hunting and
fishing cultures (Tlingit, Alutiiq, Dena'ina, Unangan) but the region does not reflect the
environmental stability and security often evoked in social development models.
Perturbations include climate-forced shifts in the marine ecosystem, fluctuating abundance
of key subsistence species, earthquakes that destroy settlements and alter shorelines,
volcanic eruptions, and glacial advances. Human responses have included migration,
sudden turns in subsistence focus and strategy, and extensive systems of political alliance
and exchange. The archaeological data emphasize flexibility and resilience as components
of social complexity.

(SPONSORED BY SAA ETHICS COMMITTEE)
The looting of archaeological sites does more than destroy a precious non-renewable
resource it potentially undermines the basis for scholarship and our understanding of the
past. How does uncertainty surrounding the history and context of multiple items in a
particular data set affect our ability to interpret and understand the past? How can we
balance the understandable desire to capture information from looted objects against the
pitfalls of basing interpretations or theories on potentially fake or misattributed materials, or
build secure archaeological interpretations on the basis of items that do not themselves
have secure provenance or provenience?
[196] SYMPOSIUM · THE TAINOS: MYTH, INVENTION OR REALITY?
The term Taino is widely used to refer to the people that at Contact inhabited the islands
from the northern Lesser Antilles to eastern Cuba and the Bahamas. However, the lack of a
generally accepted definition has produced confusion among scholars working in the
region. On one hand, the term seems to be useful to study similarities between groups from
different islands, while, on the other, it obscures variability important for the study of more
localized economical, social and political processes. The purpose of this symposium is to
present different views and meanings of the concept and to discuss possible suggestions
and perspectives for its use in the future.

INVESTIGATIONS AT UXBENKA AND PUSILHA
For several decades archaeologists have proposed that complex Classic Period polities in
the southern Belize region formed a homogeneous "cultural region" or "Maya realm." This
thinking was based on the rapid growth and decline of communities across a
geographically circumscribed area, combined with readings of hieroglyphic texts and the
application of favored models of political organization. Recent studies at Pusilha and
Uxbenka suggest quite different developmental trajectories for these two sites. This

NORTHWEST MEXICO
Shell has been used as an item for trade, an offering to better fortunes, an adornment and
a marker for status, a tool, and an instrument for music or religious ceremony. In Northwest
Mexico, shell stands out for its excellent preservation in the archaeological record and for
the information about the communities who worked it, traded it, and used it. A discussion of
this topic in and outside of Northwest Mexico seems timely and important. While
contributions from other areas will be presented to compare shell use patterns, the focus
lies on understanding shell use in Northwest Mexico.
[199] FORUM · FIELD SCHOOLS: FUNDING AND FUTURES
This forum explores issues and challenges related to running and funding archaeological
field schools. Discussion topics include the sometimes cantankerous relationships between
archaeologists and university administrators; strategies for convincing non-archaeologists
(including administrators) of the value of field school; field school funding levels and
models; and the role private donors can play in funding field schools, the unique obligations
private funding can incur, and cultivation of donor-archaeologist relationships. Discussants
will include archaeologists who run field schools of various sizes with highly variable
funding structures and a university administrator and private donor who will offer thoughts
from those perspectives.
[200] SYMPOSIUM · UNDERSTANDING LOCAL ECONOMIES AND SOCIO-POLITICAL CHANGE IN
ECUADOR: A HOUSEHOLD AND COMMUNITY PERSPECTIVE
Socio-political change in the Northern Andes has been explained repeatedly in terms of
models that emphasize the development of specialized economies and trade. In this
symposium we evaluate these models through the examination of cases from Ecuador for
which reconstruction of local economies is available at the household and community level.
This perspective allows a view into economic dynamics that makes it possible to evaluate if
and how specialization, trade or economic differentiation are to be considered key aspects
in diverse processes of socio-political change.
[201] SYMPOSIUM · (RE)DEFINING COLONIAL ENCOUNTERS: ARCHAEOLOGIES OF AFRICAN

Colonialism has been the topic of considerable theoretical interest in recent archaeology.
Despite important conceptual advances, a challenge persists in accounting for and
elucidating the plurality of experiences that occurred at different places and paces,
involving different colonial regimes and subject populations -- and whether available
approaches can help us conceptualize this heterogeneity. To engage these discussions,
this session gathers African case-studies that explore the rhythms, subjectivities, and
materialities that infused early colonial encounters on the continent. The papers propose
perspectives and narratives aimed to foster conversation and debate with broader
archaeological reflections on the dynamics of colonial situations.

laboratory management practices. Analyses of community organization, transportation
routes, architecture, mortuary practices, stature, ceramics, ground stone, ornaments, and
faunal remains are on-going. This poster session highlights the results of several research
directions that together contribute to our knowledge of the history and prehistory of

[223] SYMPOSIUM · MOLECULAR ARCHAEOLOGY PART I: ANCIENT DNA FOR THE
ARCHAEOLOGIST
This session is Part I of II showcasing the emerging field of Molecular Archaeology,
presenting research applying ancient DNA techniques to address archaeological questions
and issues. This recent research uses genetic data specifically to answer archaeological
questions about human behaviour, and human-animal and human-plant interaction in the
past. The papers in this session will highlight the unique potential of ancient DNA analysis
to enhance many areas of archaeological research, including human migrations, health and
diseases, subsistence practice, domestication, trade and interactions.
[224] SYMPOSIUM · CLIMATE, PEOPLE AND BEHAVIOR, A SYMPOSIUM IN HONOR OF REID
BRYSON
Dr. Reid Bryson has used the knowledge amassed during a career as a climatologist to
benefit archaeologists. Bryson and Bryson developed Archaeoclimatology, bringing a new
dimension to the study of paleoenvironments. This system provides a visualization of high-
resolution climatic variables for the past. Modeling past climates is just the first step in
studying paleoenvironments since ground-truthing against proxy data is required.
Understanding past climates is essential to understanding human use of natural resources.
Modeling past climates, when combined with proxy data, provides a baseline system for
discussing cultural adaptations of people at any scale whether continental, regional, or
local.
[225] SYMPOSIUM · DARK ORIGINS AND BRIGHT FUTURES: SPELEOCENTRIC APPROACHES TO
THE  ARCHAEOLOGY OF CAVES IN NORTH AMERICA, PART 1: WESTERN NORTH AMERICA
Even before archaeology existed as a discrete discipline, archaeologists sought out caves
and rockshelters for the excellent preservation of their protected deposits. This made caves
ideal for addressing many research questions, yet little research examined the actual
purposes for which prehistoric people entered caves. These two sessions will present
speleocentric research from across North America that recognizes prehistoric cave activity
as qualitatively different from surface activity and primarily religious in nature.
[226] SYMPOSIUM · REGIONAL AND INTERREGIONAL INTERACTIONS IN EARLY EAST ASIA
This symposium highlights recent research on regional interaction during the late
prehistoric and early historic periods in China, Japan, and Korea. The papers discuss the
nature of interactions that took place within and between regions, analyzing the social,
economic, and political processes underlying them. They evaluate archaeological evidence
for exchange of goods, emulation of foreign styles, warfare, and symbols of elite ideology.
Rather than assuming primacy of core-periphery models with a single core and passive
peripheries, this symposium considers the reciprocal and complex nature of interactions in
the past, emphasizing human agency, local strategies, and in situ developments.
[227] SYMPOSIUM · THE FORMATIVE PERIOD IN MESOAMERICA: VIEWS OF OLMAN
This symposium presents a series of recent hypotheses regarding the Mesoamerican
Formative Period Olmec phenomenon as it was materialized both inside and outside
Olman on the Southern Gulf Coast. Of concern is the presence or lack of evidence for two-
way interaction between various regions in Mesoamerica. External regions include the
Soconusco Coast, Oaxaca, West Mexico, Honduras, and the Guatemala Highlands. These
issues are addressed by observing individual sites, regional analyses, and overviews of
exchange, acquisition, and technologies involving ceramics, obsidian, and agriculture. All
aspects of the archaeological record are considered including the material culture,
ideology, cosmology, and technologies.
[228] SYMPOSIUM · TENSION AND TRANSITION: RELIGIOUS IDEOLOGIES IN THE PUEBLO
SOUTHWEST, A.D. 1250 TO 1450
By the late-1200s, the ancestral Pueblo world was transformed by regional depopulation,
migration, and aggregation into large plaza-oriented villages. Archaeologists commonly
associate these events with climatic change, but many now acknowledge the role of new

religious movements in the reorganization of these communities. Religious movements
such as the pre-Hispanic Katsina and related Southwestern religions were used to
negotiate social identities within aggregated villages, to mitigate conflict, and were perhaps
manipulated as an emergent source of power. This symposium examines the
materialization and social context of these religious beliefs during the prelude to the
modern Pueblo world in the American Southwest.
[229] SYMPOSIUM · SELECTIVE FOCI OR FUZZY DATA RESOLUTION: POLITICAL            ANTHROPOLOGY
AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF POLITICAL PRODUCTION IN THE PAST
Archaeological treatments of politics in past human societies have for decades primarily
focused on large-scale institutional structures and contexts, often neglecting the political
practices of everyday life. In this session we seek to expand our understanding of politics
by including the diversity of practices and strategic actions that orient social relations at a
variety of scales and in multiple contexts. Using archaeological datasets, we explore
various relationships between past peoples, places, objects and environments with a view
toward recognizing a diversity of past political actions and strategies, including their
motivations and social consequences.
[230] SYMPOSIUM · RED FISH (SALMON), WHITE FISH (COD), BIG FISH (HALIBUT), SMALL FISH
(HERRING): THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF NORTH PACIFIC FISHERIES
Variable form, focus, and intensity are increasingly evident in Pacific Northwest Coast
fisheries. Although the importance of salmon is well-known, the timing and extent of its use
varies widely, while the value of Pacific cod, herring, and other fish is generally under-
appreciated. Spatial and temporal variability is attributable to environmental variation and
change, settlement patterns, technology, transportation and trade, or alternatively to
resource depression or control and management. Papers examine patterns and trends in
fisheries, offer strategies for evaluating different explanations of archaeologically observed
variability, and assess the importance of different species to the Indigenous peoples of the
North Pacific.
[231] SYMPOSIUM · QUEBRADA JAGUAY: MARITIME ADAPTATIONS AND THE PALEOINDIAN TO
ARCHAIC OCCUPATION OF SOUTHERN PERU
Ten years after initial publication, Quebrada Jaguay (ca 13,000-8200 cal yr BP) remains
one of the oldest New World fishing sites as well as the strongest South American case for
Paleoindian-age coast-highland interaction. Through two field seasons at the site, multiple
seasons in adjacent areas, and a decade of analysis, we have deepened our
understanding of the early South Americans of southern Peru, with implications for the
peopling of South America. This session presents the stratigraphy, chronology,
architecture, lithics, paleobotany, zooarchaeology, geochemistry, paleogeography,
settlement pattern, and long-distance connections of Quebrada Jaguay and its region.
[232] SYMPOSIUM · ANDEAN HOUSEHOLDS: NEW PERSPECTIVES FROM THE HIGHLANDS AND
THE NORTH COAST
This symposium addresses households and domestic contexts from all time periods in the
Andes. Contributors will link household assemblages and domestic practice to wider social,
economic, or political dynamics. In addition, presenters will use household contexts to
address continuities and discontinuities observed in the Andes through various time
periods. Households have been an important facet of archaeological research for the last
twenty years and have become a major focus of methodological and theoretical discourse.
This symposium will serve to synthesize current themes, foci, and concerns in the field of
domestic studies.
[233] SYMPOSIUM · COMMUNITY INTEGRATION IN EASTERN MESOAMERICA
The means by which prehistoric societies integrated themselves has become an area of
intensive research. Communities in particular are no longer seen as natural social units but
as socially constituted units. This session examines ancient community integration in
different historical and cultural contexts and from a variety of methodological and
theoretical perspectives.

CENTRE OF MINANHA
In this session we plan to present data from archaeological and paleo-environmental
research conducted at the site of Minanha, located in North Vaca plateau of western Belize.
Presenters in this session will highlight the work that has been conducted at this site both
with regards to how this research elucidates the history and socio-political organization of
the site itself and how this research contributes to our understanding of the region and the
Maya area as a whole.
[235] SYMPOSIUM · THE OTHER COAST: COASTAL ECONOMIES AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN
THE W ESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC
The coast of Atlantic Canada is a productive ecosystem that has hosted an ebb and flow of
various cultures that successfully adapted to a dynamic environment and resource
structure. These cultures represent different levels of social complexity, and various
economic patterns. The papers discussed in this session will examine adaptations of many
of these groups and discuss current research focused on a better understanding of their
lifeways. They will include discussion of prehistoric and historic economic strategies and
social organization in a region that today is still heavily reliant on resources in the North
Atlantic and its margins.
[236] FORUM · MODELING PALEOINDIAN SITES AND ASSEMBLAGES: PIDBA (PALEOINDIAN
DATABASE OF THE AMERICAS) AND OTHER APPROACHES
This forum explores how researchers exploring Paleoindian archaeology in the Americas
can present and share data electronically, and examines the kinds of analyses that can be
conducted using large datasets. The Paleoindian Database of the Americas (PIDBA) is one
online example that involves researchers from across the hemisphere compiling locational
and attribute data on Paleoindian sites and artifacts. These data have been used to explore
Paleoindian settlement patterns, group ranges, population change, and the ecological
associations of early sites, as well as morphological and typological variability within early
assemblages.
[237] GENERAL SESSION · REGIONAL INTERACTION IN THE INKA WORLD
[238] SYMPOSIUM · BEYOND ZINJ: VARIABILITY IN BUTCHERY PATTERNS AT EARLY STONE AGE
SITES
Understanding Plio-Pleistocene hominin dietary behavior and ecology is crucial to the
development of evolutionary models concerning hominin anatomy and behavior. While
zooarchaeological research is becoming increasingly methodologically sophisticated,
incorporating novel approaches in taphonomy, experimental design, and ethnoarchaeology,
some paradigmatic problems remain. Often, discussions of Early Stone Age hominin faunal
exploitation are dominated by one large, well-preserved archaeofauna from Olduvai Gorge:
FLK (22) Zinjanthropus. This session will broaden the scope of ESA zooarchaeology via
examination of a wider range of archaeofaunas with butchery marks, and move the focus of
early hominin zooarchaeology "beyond Zinj", towards new regional, methodological, and
theoretical foci.

This symposium assembles an array of synthesizing papers of both local and regional
studies addressing the topics of mobility and exchange from a pan-Caribbean perspective.
Contributions from the various areas skirting the Caribbean Sea will provide a panorama of
the dynamics of human mobility and the distribution of goods and ideas across the circum-
Caribbean region through time. Interrelationships between these areas and underlying
mechanisms which may have tied together communities within this macro-region will be
explored.

[241] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT STUDIES ON OBSIDIAN SOURCING, TRADE, USE, AND DATING
(SPONSORED BY INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF OBSIDIAN STUDIES)
For more than 40 years, obsidian studies in archaeology have contributed significantly to
our understanding of long-distance trade and exchange in many parts of the world, and to
dating archaeological sites especially when radiocarbon or other methods could not be
used. More recent advances in analytical instrumentation have resulted in an increased
number of studies on geological sources and the testing of statistically significant numbers
of archaeological artifacts, frequently using non-destructive methods at low cost-per-
sample rates. The papers in this session represent new obsidian research projects from all
around the world, including Europe, Africa, Asia, North, and South America.
[242] SYMPOSIUM · ESPACIO Y PAISAJE EN ARQUEOLOGÍA
La categoría de espacio ha sido abordada tradicionalmente en arqueología como una
cuestión pasiva, estática, mensurable, describible; sin embargo, el impacto de las
reflexiones actuales en la arqueología ha generado el debate sobre su complejidad. Los
aportes recientes abordan la cuestión desde la fenomenología, la hermenéutica, el
privilegio metodológico del sujeto, la experiencia, la agencia, la interacción entre actores
sociales, los campos discursivos, los sistemas simbólicos, la vida cotidiana, entre otros
elementos de análisis. En este symposium se abordaran estudios de caso americanos, así
como diversos planteamientos teóricos y metodológicos sobre el espacio y el paisaje en
arqueología.
[243] SYMPOSIUM · CURRENT AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN SHELL MIDDEN RESEARCH
The analysis of shell middens, and/or shell bearing sites has evolved dramatically over the
past several years. While species identification and quantification remain staples in the
discipline, the implementation of new analytical techniques has allowed for more complex
questions to be explored. This session highlights the potential for new avenues of shell
midden research through the application of sclerochronology, geochemistry, biomass
reconstruction and modeling. It also features traditional macro and microscopic
approaches. The integration of analytical techniques makes it possible to address issues
concerning paleoclimate, human adaptation to coastal environments and their impact on
marine ecosystems.
[244] SYMPOSIUM · PENINSULAR TALES: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE TARACO PENINSULA
POLITY
The past five years have seen an explosion of research in the Late Formative Period (200
B.C.E.-C.E. 500) of the southern basin of Lake Titicaca. Previously largely unknown, it has
become clear that this period gave rise to the first generation of regional polities in South-
Central Andean prehistory. The social changes, political economies, regional networks, and
practices of social distinction that developed in these early polities set the stage for
Tiwanaku state formation at the end of the period. We present the results of three seasons
of excavations and analysis within the territory of one of these political formations.
[245] SYMPOSIUM · EXPLAINING LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY ACROSS BERINGIA, PART 1:
NORTHEAST ASIA TO ALASKA
Without question, the late-Pleistocene/early-Holocene archaeological records of northeast
Asia, Alaska, and northwest Canada are characterized by significant degrees of variability
in stone-tool technology and typology, yet we still do not know what this variability means.
New studies of lithic procurement and selection, technology, and tool function have begun
to untangle some important problems, including the apparent dichotomy between
microblade and non-microblade industries, relationship of fluted and lanceolate point
technologies, and adaptive contexts of different early industries. Our symposium presents
new studies of technological organization and assemblage systematics, with the ultimate
goal of explaining variability in light of hunter-gatherer colonization and adaptation to
Beringia's unique environments.

from Greenland and Newfoundland to Iceland and the Faroe Islands. The projects deal with
subjects such as the social and economic foundations of the Norse Greenland colony and
the origins of the early modern fish trade. Viking Age subsistence as well as the advent of
global economies in the North Atlantic will be addressed as well. Unifying all these projects
is a concentration on Historical Ecology and Panarchy theory.
[247] FORUM · CONVERGING COMMUNITIES IN DIGITAL HERITAGE
At the heart of networks, institutions, programs and projects are people engaged with
actions and agendas that traverse the boundaries of any one organization. Within these
'virtual communities' of human effort and achievement, we converge to take on the
recurring and emerging challenges or opportunities of cultural heritage in the digital age,
often without the full appreciation of other activities that may be happening in parallel. This
forum aims to broaden our virtual community awareness through highlighting success
stories and lessons learned in digital heritage as shared by the individuals involved in their
founding, development and evolution.
[248] SYMPOSIUM · TECHNOLOGICAL PERSISTENCE AND CHANGE IN            ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
AND BEYOND
The present symposium is aimed at comparatively studying technological change and
persistence, using the development and evolution of distinct Mesoamerican technological
complexes such as lithics, pyrotechnology, and construction techniques, all in the
framework of their associated economic and social systems. The main goal is to investigate
the different modes in which technology, as a cultural variable, intermingled with the ever
evolving human societies in Mesoamerica. Further comparisons are made with analogous
technological studies from other areas, including North America and South America.
[249] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND
CULTURAL RESPONSE
(SPONSORED BY GEOARCHAEOLOGY INTEREST GROUP)
Archaeologists have long explored the complex ways that human societies have interacted
with changes in climate and landscape. Consequently, we are uniquely positioned to
provide insights into some of the implications of environmental change such as might be
precipitated by global warming. This symposium brings together scholars who approach
human-environmental/landscape interactions from various points of view to present
examples of the relationship between culture, landscape, society, and the environment.
Papers vary in terms of theoretical perspective, geographic area, temporal scale, and
substantive focus, but each is based on archaeological data that illuminates the dynamics
of human responses to environmental change.

[257] SYMPOSIUM · ANCIENT M AYA ECONOMIES OF POWER: ELITE PRODUCTION AND
DISTRIBUTION
Increasingly nuanced understandings of ancient Maya political hierarchy have revealed
courtly and subroyal elites as important players in the hegemonic nature of power.
Archaeological, hieroglyphic, and ethnohistoric sources indicate that such elites played key
roles in the movement and production of valued cultural materials, ranging from supervision
of complex systems of import, to specialized craft production resulting in materials that
marked special identities and privileges, to production of texts that created historical
precedent and articulated identity. Session participants address the spectrum of elite
involvement in production to illuminate hegemonic systems of power and their relationship
to ancient Maya economy.

Although he is best known for his work with micromorpholgy in archaeology, Paul has an
exemplary record of geoscience-based research and teaching in all aspects of
archaeology. He is the quintessential interdisciplinary scientist and merits recognition from
the SAA for his many contributions to American archaeology. This symposium honors his
career by presenting a broad range of papers that consider soils and sediments in
archaeological settings in both the New and Old World.
[260] SYMPOSIUM · WAYS OF BECOMING: DYNAMIC PROCESSES IN THE CREATION OF
ATHAPASKAN IDENTITIES AND LANDSCAPES
At European contact Athapaskan speakers occupied a vast expanse of western North
America, from the Arctic to the Sierra Madre. This dispersion provides an unparalleled
opportunity to examine continuity and change on a continental scale through the integration
of cultural, oral, and archaeological traditions. Symposium participants offer diverse
perspectives on Athapaskan history, using anthropological theory, archaeological projects,
and community interactions to explore topics including: the circumstances surrounding
Athapaskan migration, the relationship between language and material culture in the
creation and maintenance of Athapaskan identities, key social and technological thresholds
in Athapaskan history, and interaction between Athapaskans and neighbouring societies.
[261] SYMPOSIUM · CONNECTED PASTS: CURRENT NETWORK APPROACHES IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Archaeology has an historical engagement with network concepts, which reflects the
discipline's concern with various forms of social relatedness. Current network analysis
methods investigate the dynamics, robustness, connectivity, and navigation of various
social and biological networks. These analytical tools can be used to address topics
germane to archaeology including: changes in prehistoric social and political organization,
transmission of innovations, the evolution of trade networks, and responses to
environmental change. This symposium explores current approaches to network analysis in
archaeology and discusses how these approaches facilitate inferences about the scale,
dynamics, and interaction of past social systems.

REGION AD 1050-1200
In the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, the Aztec and Salmon communities in the
Middle San Juan region emerged as population and sociopolitical centers during the
closing decades of Chaco Canyon's ascendancy. Some archaeologists have attributed
these developments to migration from Chaco Canyon, 75 km to the south. Others have
suggested that the Chacoan "system" was the result of emulation of Chacoan
characteristics by local groups in "Outlier" communities. This symposium reports on
National Science Foundation-sponsored research that explores these alternatives--
migration and emulation--in the emergence of Aztec, Salmon, and several smaller,
contemporary communities from AD 1050-1200.
[267] SYMPOSIUM · ROCKING BELIZE: NEW APPROACHES TO LITHIC ANALYSIS AT M AYA SITES
With the discovery of the extensive workshops at the site of Colha in the 1970s, lithic
analyses at sites in Belize focused on a model of lithic production known as the producer-
consumer model. Recent research explores the complexity of the model and how even
individual households acted as consumers and producers. Most communities contained
both consumers and producers using a mix of locally available and imported raw materials.
This session explores the variety of approaches used by the ancient Maya to produce and
obtain chipped stone tools as well as those used by archaeologists in analyzing these
systems.
[268] SYMPOSIUM · HYBRIDIZATION AND COLONIZATION: CROSS-CULTURAL PERSPECTIVES
Several recent studies have focused on the phenomenon of cultural contact in antiquity,
often resulting from colonial encounters, trade and exchange, colonization or political
domination. In such situations of interaction between culturally diverse human groups, we
often observe a process that postcolonial scholars term 'hybridization' Hybridization is an
active form, in which the meeting and mixing of peoples of varied identities and cultural
practices result in the creation of entirely new cultural norms, marked by new ways of doing
things and new perceptions of meaning. This session will aim to present case studies in
which the archaeological record illustrates the processes of hybridization and/or
colonization.

Intellectual property (IP) issues, both real and imagined, are emerging as a critical topic in
archaeological theory, practice, policy, and ethics. Who owns rights to knowledge about the
past, including that derived from human genetic sources? How is the access to information
movement affecting archaeology? How applicable are legal concepts of copyright, patents,
and trademarks to what archaeologists do? What are the implications of IP in negotiating

This symposium aims to promote the potential of archaeometallurgy in addressing
problems of past social complexity and cultural development. Although metals have long
been of archaeological interest, archaeometallurgy has been regarded as distinct from the
general field of archaeology. More recently, archaeometallurgical approaches have sought
to complement scientific understandings of past technologies with a more thorough
appreciation of the interrelated human aspects. Through the application of advanced
analytical techniques, many aspects of past societies are now being addressed, allowing
greater understanding of how metals were produced, utilised and regarded within past
communities.

PREHISTORIC COASTAL ADAPTATIONS IN THE PUERTO PENASCO AREA, SONORA, MEXICO
Archaeological investigations have been conducted in recent years by Mexican and
American scientists in the northeastern Gulf of California, focusing on prehistoric use of the
coastal zone, particularly in the vicinity of Puerto Pe o. Extensive shell middens line are
concentrated around tidal estuaries, used by various prehistoric cultures, including Archaic,
Hohokam, Trincheras, and Lowland Patayan. Research interests include study of
prehistoric coastal subsistence strategies and occupation patterns, and mid- to late
Holocene paleoenvironments. Surface artifact assemblages, excavated artifacts and
subsistence remains, and recently obtained C14 dates demonstrate use of marine and
terrestrial resources from middle Archaic through late prehistoric times.

Reconstructing patterns of population movement and subsistence in Andean South
America permits significant insights into ancient political economy, resource distribution,
and culture change. Though these processes traditionally have been difficult to measure
archaeologically, analysis of stable isotopes in preserved remains show remarkable
promise in elucidating both regional movement and subsistence patterns among
individuals. This symposium highlights on-going isotopic research from diverse central
Andean contexts and cultures, including Nasca, Moche, Wari, Tiwanaku and Inca. The
breadth of regional coverage and convergence of methodologies and theoretical
perspectives provides a comprehensive look at current and future isotopic research in the

After 12 years of excavation, this session aims to present the diversity and
interdisciplinarity of archaeological research at Catalhoyuk, Turkey and highlight the
complexity of social worlds at Neolithic Catalhoyuk. The unique time-depth at Catalhoyuk
has allowed a detailed examination of everyday life, while lateral excavation exposure has
revealed neighborhoods and household exchange. Depositional processes detail a schema
of buried objects, hidden meanings, multiple uses, curation, and acquisition, revealing an
entanglement of individuals, houses, and things. Each paper will illustrate how a social
archaeology is constructed from the bottom up, through the data and with the benefits of
collaborative efforts.
[277] SYMPOSIUM · CHANGING POLITIES, ECONOMIES, AND IDENTITIES IN CLASSIC AND
POSTCLASSIC CENTRAL MEXICO: PERSPECTIVES FROM CERRO PORTEZUELO
We discuss new data from field and laboratory investigations bearing on the closely
intertwined topics of political systems, economies, and identities in highland central Mexico.
For the period of Teotihuacan's dominance we consider the production and distribution of
ceramics and stone tools, diverse identities as reflected in burial practices, and relations
between the city and nearby hinterland settlements, especially Cerro Portezuelo. We also
address the collapse of the Teotihuacan state and shifts in politics, economics, and
identities, reformulations in the era of Tula's prominence, the rise of the Aztece empire, and
catastrophic consequences of the Spanish conquest.
[278] SYMPOSIUM · WASDEN RESURRECTED: ANALYSIS, INTERPRETATION AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS FOR IDAHO’S UNSUNG TERMINAL PLEISTOCENE/EARLY HOLOCENE SITE
Due to the deficiency of published material from Owl Cave, many leading archaeologists
have dismissed the site as lacking sufficient evidence of a clear association between
humans and extinct megafauna. However, a recent examination of records, documents and
artifacts from prior excavations reveals the tremendous potential the site still retains in
generating critical data on early human adaptations in the Northern Great Basin. This
symposium spearheads efforts to renew research at the Wasden Site. These efforts will
involve a thorough reassessment of existing collections (including the bison bone bed,
proboscidean remains and their reported association with fluted points), recent
conservation efforts, and the theoretical and methodological focus of future research at the

This session brings together scholars involved in current research in and around the Tuxtla
Mountains of Southern Veracruz, Mexico. Research conducted recently varies in the scales
of analysis, from broad regional surveys to investigations at individual sites. In addition,
studies are increasingly varied in their temporal scope. The studies here also employ a
variety of methods, such as geophysics, and they examine diverse datasets (e.g., botanical
remains). Together these studies propel us toward a more refined understanding of
regional prehistory and the ways that Tuxtecos and their neighbors navigated the many
dimensions of life in the southern Gulf lowlands.
[280] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM · RECENT ADVANCES IN MESOAMERICAN CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY
Mesoamerican cave archaeology has experienced explosive growth during the last decade
as archaeologists recognize caves as one of the best venues for addressing questions
dealing with the archaeology of religion. Exploration of new caves and restudies of known
sites are rapidly expanding the field’s data base. New approaches, particularly the use of
ethnoarchaeology, challenge old assumptions and recontextualize research questions. This
session presents an overview of the latest research in the discipline.

[282] SYMPOSIUM · OUT OF THE BOX: INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO CULTURAL HERITAGE AND
GRASSROOTS COMMUNICATION EFFORTS
As archaeologists grapple with the colonial legacy of archaeology and confront issues of
social and economic justice for indigenous peoples, there is a need to invent ways of
communicating with descendant groups. This dialogue includes both learning and
respecting local knowledge and sharing with stakeholders the knowledge accrued by over a
century of archaeological research. The latter is particularly acute where colonial processes
have resulted in a contraction of ancestral knowledge, delinking of the past and present,
and minimal opportunities for formal education about cultural heritage. In this symposium,
participants present innovative approaches to dialogue with local/descendant communities.
[283] FORUM · GRANTS, AWARDS, AND FELLOWSHIPS: FINDING FUNDING IN ARCHAEOLOGY-
RELATED FIELDS
(SPONSORED BY STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE)
The search for funding is a pressing issue in the field of archaeology, and young scholars
applying independently for research funding often find they have little or no experience with
this task. This forum, sponsored by the Student Affairs Committee, offers an opportunity to
remedy this problem. A panel of five professional archaeologists with relevant experience
will discuss the grant-writing process, providing tips and suggestions, and answering basic
questions about funding application processes. The panelists' varied backgrounds enable
them to offer advice on a wide range of project topics including archaeological science,
museum and art conservation, and archaeological field schools.

Much new data has been collected in the 40 years since the groundbreaking Prince Rupert
Harbour Project launched the modern era of Pacific north coastal archaeology. This
working group discussion brings together an intergenerational and interdisciplinary
community of scholars including the director and students on the original project with
current researchers and graduate students. New regional data from a variety of survey and
excavation projects along the northern coast of BC and Alaska are now available to
enhance and develop the culture history, evaluate the existing explanatory models, and
explore the links between the archaeological and indigenous oral records.
[289] SYMPOSIUM · ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO UNDERSTANDING SOCIO-
ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS: EMERGING COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN ECOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY
Researchers across the globe are finding that strongly integrated interdisciplinary research
is essential for grappling effectively with the real-world complexities of socioecological
systems. Moreover, there is the growing realization that deciphering human-environmental
relations requires the time depth accessible through the archaeological record. Despite an
increasing interest in using archaeological knowledge to address contemporary human-
environment issues, there seems to be uncertainty as to how to proceed. The papers in this
session discuss on-going collaborative research between archaeologists, ecologists, and
land managers as a way of exploring the different ways in which archaeological expertise
and data can contribute to contemporary problem-solving.

reproduction, and contestation of cultural structures. This theoretical foundation
emphasizes daily practice, routine, and experience as facets of investigation for
archaeologists interested in interpreting social structures from economic or material
activities. The importance of this theoretical view in archaeology is that social relationships
and social actions can be interpreted from the often mundane and habitual actions of
everyday life, which is what forms most of the archaeological record. This symposium
investigates the application of practice theory to a variety of cultural processes documented
in the material record by a diverse group of researchers.
[291] SYMPOSIUM · A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE ON         ARCHAEOLOGICAL HUMAN REMAINS:
CONVERGENCE OR DIVERSITY IN APPROACHES?
The study of human remains is as old as the discipline of archaeology but has had
chequered histories in different world areas. This session examines past and current
tendencies in studies of archaeologically-retrieved human remains across a range of
geopolitical settings. Methodological approaches have been increasingly standardised in
recent decades. Has this led to a convergence in approaches to archaeological human
remains or do significant differences remain? We specifically emphasize research areas
outside the USA and Britain, which have tended to be well-represented in Anglophone
publications, and seek to elucidate other trajectories in the study of archaeological human
remains.
[292] SYMPOSIUM · RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN SOUTH AMERICAN COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGY
Coastal archaeology has become an important area of archaeological investigation,
especially in South America. However, sometimes a broader dissemination of research
advances lags behind. This symposium tries to bring together archaeologists working in the
region that have varied perspectives on topics such as intensification of marine resource
use, emergence of social complexity, subsistence patterns, connections between social
organization and coastal resources, among others. The aim of the session is to assess the
current status of investigations in South America, and explore their similarities and
differences.

for more than two decades. However, if public archaeology is to mature, a shared
understanding of the core ideas and values associated with it should be developed among
the profession. What do we expect an archaeologically literate citizenry to know? This
symposium highlights some of the most well established archaeology education programs
in the world, the fundamental ideas that support them, and the results of research on actual
learning.

social spheres are played out in the decision-making process of herding: balancing the
concern for minimizing subsistence risk with the desire for maximizing future reward. Issues
to be addressed include the levels at which herding decisions are made (households,
villages, centralized administrations), herding goals (resilience/herd security, surplus
production, rank/prestige), and how these inform strategies of intensification, diversification,
and specialization, actively shaping the development of complex societies and their
trajectories of change.

[301] SYMPOSIUM · MESOAMERICA'S COLONIAL-POSTCOLONIAL TRAJECTORY:
ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS
No issue is more relevant to questions of sociocultural change in Mesoamerica than the
colonial-postcolonial trajectory. This history envelops three major political-economic
conjunctures. In the 16th century, imperial incorporation of Mesoamerica into Spain’s
transoceanic empire disrupted indigenous development. In the 19th century, the colonies’
withdrawal from Spain’s empire ignited indigenous insurrections. In the 20th century, the
expansion of the U.S.-based global economy occasioned significant demographic,
technological, and environmental change. The archaeological evidence of this process has
yet to be scrutinized systematically. In this session, researchers working in key
Mesoamerican regions examine the material manifestations of this trajectory and test their
evidence against the written record.

For over 2000 years, between 800 BC and AD 1200, Chan's residents built homes and
agricultural terraces and constructed a small ceremonial center. Chan's occupation history
provides a window into life in a small community across an expanse of Maya history. For
six years archaeologists have investigated Chan to assess the complex and changing
nature of community life and examine how it affected and was affected by broader changes
in Maya society. By exploring life at Chan, this session illustrates how understanding the
organization of farming communities is critical for our interpretations of the operation of
ancient societies.

development of archaeology as a science. This session is dedicated to honoring the
traditions of lithic analysis by challenging widely held ideas and exploring innovative
approaches focusing on application of experimental data to archaeological research.
Papers cover topics ranging from the earliest Paleolithic of East Africa and Java to the

under the purview of art history and the emerging 'anthropologies of art.' Such methods for
interpreting the visual record have the potential to reveal levels of social interaction
otherwise untapped by traditional anthropological and art historical approaches. Through
investigations including the distribution of image tropes, ceramic designs as indicators of
interaction, and architecture as a form of legitimization, this session will use the visual
record to approach a better understanding of social interaction in the ancient Americas.

[119] Unparalleled Production: Hohokam Pottery Specialization in the Phoenix Basin,
Arizona
Prehistoric Hohokam ceramic production in the Phoenix basin of Arizona was unparalleled
in the Southwest by the extent and long duration of specialist manufacture. For more than
500 years, only three spatially concentrated potter groups made more than 90 percent of all
pots used in the irrigation-based communities along the lower Salt River. This remarkable
stability in the production and distribution networks came to an end during the middle
Sedentary period (ca. A.D. 1000-1070) when new groups of artisan specialists dominated
production. The mode of production changed again around A.D. 1100, when localized
manufacture throughout the valley became the norm.

[320] Agriculture origins on the Colombian Corillera Central
This talk’s objective is to present the latest data about agriculture origins on the Colombian
Cordillera Central (northern South America). Archaeological data recovered from several
sites indicate that forager societies that colonized and settled on the region since late
Pleistocene managed a number of plants; transforming the vegetal coverage and therefore
altering native forests. By middle Holocene archaeological and microbotanical evidences
indicate they practiced an early agriculture of several taxa; such as Dioscorea, Manihot,
Xanthosoma, and Zea Mays. The data demonstrate the early adoption and quick dispersals
of cultigens throughout northern South America.

Three sites with microblade assemblages, Nukluk Mountain, Ilnuk, and Lime Hills Cave
provide insights into the culture of those hunting groups who occupied the Kuskokwim
River region in southwestern Alaska at the beginning of the Holocene. The Nukluk
Mountain site was a lookout station where hunters awaited the fall migration of caribou at
the edge of the Kuskokwim River lowlands. The Ilnuk site served as a lookout site
overlooking the Holitna River and where microblade production was an important site
activity. Lime Hills Cave overlooking the Stony River lowlands was a temporary stopover
where hunters replaced edge-damaged microblades from slotted antler arrowheads.

Four seasons of excavations at Chevelon Pueblo, a 500-room, 14th century, ancient Hopi
village in northeastern Arizona, have yielded a wide array of remains that suggest religious
ritual behaviors as their cause. These include structural burning, robust floor assemblages,
and fill deposits involving multiple rare and unusual artifacts. The asymmetrical distribution
of these deposits at Chevelon suggests consolidation of power and negotiation of social

[106] Megaliths and Labor Mobilization in West Sumba, Indonesia
Megalithic monuments can require substantial inputs of labor to construct. The presence of

considerable discussion of their social and symbolic significance. The issue of labor
mobilization essential for the erection of megaliths has received little attention
comparatively. In this paper, I present an ethnoarchaeological examination of the labor
dynamics associated with the living tradition of building megalithic tombs in West Sumba,
Indonesia. The case of West Sumba shows how large pools of both kin and non-kin labor
can be assembled in the absence of corvée arrangements and centralized regional

[134] Figuring the Méxica World at Malinalco: Ideology and Socialization at a Kiva-Like
Lookout Complex
Mesoamerican warfare conventions encouraged behavior based on aesthetics of power;
however, archaeological skeletal interpretation often ignores this politically contingent
context by focusing on a narrow range of possibilities, often that of so-called “sacrifice.”
Embedded in the “habitus” of the individual, and community, Méxica warriors learned the
complex behavioral motivations affecting how they perceived and ritually interacted with
others. Their cosmologically charged warfare codes, focused on performance, prestige,
execution, and feasting, encouraged ideal models of service and courage. Attention will be
placed in this paper on Mesoamerican wide indigenous notions of warrior socialization as
perhaps practiced at such sites like Malinalco.

[313] Lithic microwear analysis in Japanese prehistoric studies: Functional interpretation

Lithic microwear analysis for functional determination has been applied widely in Japanese
archaeology. However, the fundamental problem of discrepancy between experimental
results and actual microwear patterns on excavated artifacts remains to be solved. Tohoku

The interpretative criteria are based on 650 controlled experiments for Japanese lithic raw
materials. The paper proposes a new approach to the traceological problem with a
framework of technological organization and the palimpsest characteristics of microwear.

The Palos Verdes Peninsula contains numerous sites employed by the Gabrieliño/Tongva.
Many of these sites have been disturbed since they were first recorded. The goal of this
study is to reassess these sites in order to determine connections between the smaller
seed gathering/processing and hunting sites and the larger coastal sites. Although the
steep cliffs and canyons of the peninsula may have made land travel between coastal sites
and sites on the terraces of the peninsula difficult, the array of sites appears to represent

[134] On Stars and Skeletons: reflections on the role of religion in state-sponsored violence
Ritual warfare and human sacrifice are often portrayed as characteristic of Mesoamerican
civilizations. Purportedly backed by mythological charter under Aztec rule, for the Classic
Maya, analogous activities have been read from hieroglyphic inscriptions at several
archaeological sites. But the archaeological and historical records require substantial
interpretation to get from observable patterns to cultural motivation. This paper takes up
specific hieroglyphic records interpreted as ritual warfare–the so-called Venus calibrated
“Star Wars”–to suggest that state-sponsored violence in ancient Mesoamerica might have
been less tied to religiously mandated activity and better read as the exertion of
‘technologies of power.’

ranking in the Late Holocene diet as their habitats grew in size, permanence, and

born of interactions between local people and immigrants. These interactions fueled a new

from European copper. Excavations at the Meier and Cathlapotle sites yielded 170 copper
artifacts from domestic contexts spanning AD 1400 – 1830. Since Native copper objects
are probably rare, sampling for isotopic analysis might miss them. Isotopic analysis of the

repetition of the same structure types at different scales of settlement and a weak internal
hierarchization in each neighborhood, both indicate a degree of emulation and cooperation
between local social groups. These social and political dynamics remain difficult to assess
and define, but the many Highlands documents enlighten these mechanisms.

accumulation of social power by elites. Mesa Verde Puebloans experienced an ebb and
flow of people within the region from A.D. 600 to the 1200s, and because of sociopolitical
and environmental pressures, ultimately migrated to the Rio Grande. Mesa Verde
Puebloans employed migration and resettlement as a mechanism to cope with these
problems and successfully achieved the localization process. I use lithic data to show how
Mesa Verde Puebloans coped with sociopolitical-environmental difficulties and engaged in
the localization process during the six centuries prior to depopulation.

[11] Evaluating explanations for the Irish chambered grave typology
The typology of the Irish chambered graves might be explainable in terms of different
functions for each of the Megalithic tombs, rather than the work of different peoples. I
investigate the implications for the geographic distribution of combinations of discrete
architectural features of the monuments using a revised classification of the monuments
and the principles of phylogenetic systematics. Cultural transmission theory is employed to
make predictions about the distribution of nested sets of similarities. The functionalist
explanation is evaluated against the chambered graves of three contiguous counties in the
southeast of Ireland.

[29] Variation in the Acheulean of Elandsfontein, South Africa: A morphometric approach
Recent research on Acheulean technology has suggested a myriad of explanations for
variation in artifact form. However, methodological advances suggest that previous
methods of analysis do not capture the full spectrum of variation in artifact form. Here we
combine geometric morphometrics with conventional approaches to isolate factors
associated with variation in Acheulean assemblages. To this end we focus on Acheulean
tools from the Middle Pleistocene site of Elandsfontein in South Africa. Results suggest that
at least some of the three dimensional shape variation in Acheulean tools is linked to the
combined affects of raw material variation and reduction intensity.

[77] Ofrendas de infantes e identidad en la arquitectura maya del Clásico
Ciertos infantes y niños pequeños son con frecuencia encontrados enterrados en grandes
vasijas cerámicas dentro de rellenos arquitectónicos durante el período Clásico maya.
Otros niños son encontrados enterrados como adultos en lugares de enterramiento normal
rodeados por bienes funerarios comunes. Esta ponencia explorará la formación de la
identidad relacionada con los niños y la infancia en la cultura maya del Clásico. Las
razones para un uso selectivo de ciertos infantes y niños en ofrendas dedicatorias puede
incluir cuestiones como el estatus como no-adultos/no-personas pero la investigación
comparativa sugiere que se deben considerar aspectos como la corporalidad del poder
sagrado y la autoridad. Se argumenta que las ofrendas infantiles reflejan la visión maya
antigua de que la identidad en la infancia y de los infantes fue liminal y estuvo imbuida de
una potencia supernatural que gradualmente se desvanece con la edad.

[235] From an Inuit village into a Moravian mission
The Inuit of Labrador were in intermittent contact with European whalers, fishermen, and
traders since the 16th century. After the arrival of German Moravian missionaries in 1771,
some Labrador Inuit moved to missions, converted to Christianity, and participated in a
European market economy. To examine this transformation archaeologically, I compare
excavated material from 17th-18th century Inuit sod houses to 18th-19th century Inuit sites
at the Hopedale Moravian mission. Examining data from this early historic period provides
information on social structures already in place, and serves as a foundation for models
attempting to explain Inuit choices during the 19th century.

[134] Killing them softly, killing them loudly: Warfare and violent display in the Andes
For archaeologists of non-literate societies, information about the cultural worldviews that
inform violence comes disproportionately from iconography and other kinds of violent
display, like public sacrifice and the displaying of trophies. This paper interrogates the
relationship between violent display and the actual intensity of violence for past Andean
populations. When were such displays common, and when was the “public transcript” about
violence muted or even silent? Contrasting patterns of warfare and display between the
Early and Late Intermediate Periods suggest messages about violence were strategically
amplified or downplayed in specific social contexts that should themselves be critically
examined.

Abolition of slavery in the Caribbean followed a variable path. The complexity of differential
colonial rule resulted in an ambiguous shift to “freedom”. This paper examines
archaeological findings and spatial analyses from a range of Caribbean contexts in the late
18th to late 19th century (with an emphasis on British, Danish, French, and Spanish
settings). It is argued that emancipation resulted in “degrees of freedom” with many
formerly enslaved laborers being caught up in a form of wage slavery. However, where
persons of color gained control of land and self employment, significantly greater degrees
of freedom were gained.

Rio Bec is not a «Maya site » with an epicenter and a periphery. It is better defined as a
rural zone characterized by dispersed monumental groups, surrounded by associated
modest groups, all residential in function. These associations are explained by combining
several models (social, agrarian, architectural), concerning the groups most intensively
excavated by the Rio Bec project (2002-2008). Their dynamics from AD 450 to 950 show
differing degrees of emulation against cooperation, leading to the development of
monumental architecture but hindering the formation of dense neighborhoods dominated by

Archaeologists often assume that abundance and richness in assemblages of material

assess this proposition. Employing systematic catalogs of household goods extracted from
an archive of 21,000 photographs, we examine measures of object ubiquity, richness, and
diversity for 32 households and explore their utility in indexing wealth and identity
expression. Ubiquitous object classes such as photos, books, electronics, media, and
collectibles may measure families’ consumerism and zeal to express identity rather than

During the late Pleistocene, there were changing landscapes due to repited events of
glaciation–deglaciation. Those conditions allowed the presence of mammal
megaherbivores and megacarnivores, which strongly impacted the landscape; in
grasslands mammoths coexisted with camels, bisons, horses, pronghorns, saber-toothed
tigers, lions, short-faced bears, and dire wolf. Similarly, forested areas were inhabitated by
mastodons, gomphotheres, groundsloths, deers, spectacled bear, tapir, jaguar, and
mountain lion. Interactions between extinct animals and humans have been found, mostly
involving mammoths, but in such a case a role as scavenger played by humans could be
better proposed than active hunting.

Political authority was established by the manipulation of social, religious, and cultural
beliefs. Rulers claimed their exulted status though blood relationships with important
ancestors, their ability to conduct successful rituals, and their gregarious personalities. In
the absence of glyphic texts, elites are identified archaeologically by their grandiose tombs,
elaborate palaces, and large temples. Was it possible for the wealthy to acquire objects of
status given their economic standing? Could a wealthy individual “buy” political power
during the Classic period? Excavations in the Belize Valley reveal new evidence to support
this possibility.

Creating social order through the perceived template of cosmic order is common in cultures

star, the phases of the moon) is different from our own. I believe this is a factor often

that these structures were built by an entire community as part of a planned migration. The
standardized way in which this migration was organized, implies planned population
movements on a regional scale.

[114] From Spanish outposts to Chumash villages: tracing the movement of locally
produced earthenware along the central coast from 1782-1820
Unglazed, low-fired earthenware is found throughout the colonial Americas in missionary,
military, and civilian settlements. Used daily by colonists and indigenous laborers in
Spanish California, these ceramics are also found in Chumash villages along the central
coast. In this paper I will explain how petrographic sourcing of California mission, presidio,
and Chumash village assemblages can reconstruct the movement of these locally
produced earthenwares across the colonial landscape near Santa Barbara. This study
refines previous analyses of site-specific acculturation to address the regional interaction
and exchange networks supporting the first generation of families straddling colonial and
indigenous economies.

[109] The Dirt on Ancient Maya Marketplace Activities II
Ancient markets are difficult to identify as most utilitarian items and consumables were
perishable. Our objective was to use geochemical analyses of extractable phosphorus and
metallic residues in soils to distinguish the unique geochemical patterns of market plazas
from other types of plazas within the Maya area of Central America. Geochemical
techniques in conjunction with locational and archaeological data have provided lines of
evidence for Marketplace activities.

[88] Tiwanaku Death and Mourning at Rio Muerto, Moquegua, Peru
The 100% excavation of a Tiwanaku cemetery at the Rio Muerto M70B site offers insights
into funerary practice and health in the region. The astounding preservation at the site
provides unique evidence of tomb and surface offerings illustrating mortuary practices of
the Omo-style Tiwanaku colonists. Aymara ethnography and ethnohistory suggest a
tradition of prolonged mourning around the time of interment. This is the first time that such
behavior is observable in the archaeological record. Studies of the population’s
demography and pathologies allow us better to understand the causes of death and their
relation to changing mortuary treatment.

[35] Evaluating the range of variation of the “local” oxygen isotope signature at the intra-
annual, inter-annual and hydrographical scales
Investigation of mobility through oxygen stable isotope measurements in skeleton remains
either lies on the identification a “non-local” signal, or on the observation of intra-individual
variability between skeleton parts formed at different moments of life. In both cases, the
basic requirement is to define the range of variation of the local signal, which can possibly
vary within the year, between years, and between local water sources of diverse kinds.
With a few examples on modern and archaeological animal populations I would like to
show that the range of variation of the local signal can be high.

[250] Dorset Paleoeskimo Sealskin Processing in Port au Choix, Northwestern
Newfoundland: A Paleoenvironmental Approach
Although the environmental impact of modern human populations has been acknowledged,
the degree to which precontact hunter-gatherers have affected the environment is not
established. Traditional activities, such as sealskin processing, utilize many facets of the
environment, and should therefore leave a local environmental signature. On the Northern
Peninsula of Newfoundland Dorset Paleoeskimos engaged in seal hunting activities for
nearly a thousand years, from 1900 to 1200 Cal BP. We propose that sealskin processing
was also taking place at this location. By examining environmental proxies, as well as
stable isotope values, the environmental impact of skin processing can be quantified.

Understanding how ancient societies organized the ways they produced stone tools
requires that we accurately identify stone artifacts chosen for some kind of use and the
trajectory of manufacture that produced these artifacts. This paper considers this problem,
using examples from the Paleoindian record on the Plains. It particularly focuses on two
issues: first, the links between descriptions of individual stone tools and larger
generalizations about overall patterns of manufacture and, second, the potential effects on
such generalizations of the documented ability of natural taphonomic processes to mimic
the processes of human use and retouch.

[244] The Taraco Peninsula Polity: An Archaeological History
The Taraco Peninsula Polity emerged from a system of competing autonomous villages at
the beginning of the Late Formative 1 period (ca. 200 B.C.E.). Its formation and borders
have been inferred from regional demographic processes. Its first capital was the site of
Kala Uyuni. Around C.E. 200 the capital shifted to the three neighboring sites of the Santa
Rosa Group and an outflow of population to Tiwanaku began. Between C.E. 300-500 the
Taraco Peninsula became a heartland province of the newly-emerging Tiwanaku state. The
developmental trajectory and external relations of the Taraco Peninsula Polity were crucial
elements of the historical conjuncture that produced Tiwanaku state formation.

Since archaeologists first identified the Pre-Pottery Neolithic in Southwest Asia, they have
interpreted some buildings as shrines, rather than domestic structures. Although these

shared their Western distinction between sacred and profane, and overlook the alternative

[16] Who Owns Whom? Inalienable Possessions and Community Identities in the Lower
Rio Verde Valley, Oaxaca
This paper will examine the role of caches, burials, and mortuary objects as inalienable
possessions in the lower Río Verde valley of Pacific Coastal Oaxaca, Mexico. Kept out of
circulation by their burial in socially meaningful places on the landscape, earth offerings
were integral to the creation and maintenance of local community identities during the
Terminal Formative Period (150 B.C.E. – C.E. 250). We argue that earth offerings were a
means of creating relationships between groups of people and important places that
deemphasized inequality and reiterated a place-based identity that encompassed
individuals of varying social status.

[101] Hunter-gatherer specialization on marginal areas from southern South America?
Patagonia is an extended dry and cold territory located on the southern extreme of South
America, where there are at least two layers of marginality. At the supra-regional scale of
Patagonia as a whole, this is an ecologically marginal setting where alternative food
sources are few, and there is a focus on the use of guanaco (Lama guanicoe). On a
smaller scale, many regions within Patagonia can be considered as geographically
marginal (eastern Strait of Magellan, forests near the Andes). The latter areas were
discontinuously used throughout the Holocene, and except for a complementary role for
marine mammals do not display indications of specialization of any kind.

technology that transformed the study of stone artifact assemblages. As Jelinek repeatedly

characterize the inherent nature of forager lithic technology and provide robust proxy
measures of landuse practices. Applying these measures to assemblages across western
Eurasia offers new insights into the most important dimensions of Upper Pleistocene

However, where early domesticates (e.g. C4 millets) are isotopically distinct from wild (C3)

assist in establishing the chronology of the relative cultural sequences, but there is no point
in permitting radiometric dates, some of which are based on open systems such as TL and

than in naturally occurring sediments, are indicators of turf transported from the wet
lowlands. Sediment samples from within and outside a domestic longhouse were
microscopically examined. Diatoms are more common in turf deposits than the natural
prehistoric soils on which the longhouse was constructed. Therefore diatom abundance
and species can indicate anthropomorphic change to the local environment and cultural site

The archaeological record of the South India Iron Age attests to the emergence of

institutionalized authority is conspicuously absent. Excavation data and surface
documentation suggest that politically salient social distinctions were largely negotiated
through the agro-pastoral economy, feasting, building practices, and perhaps access to
specialized technology (e.g., Iron). Hence, aspects of landscape production during the
period -- the creation of places where animals were unequally grazed, cultigens were
grown, water was stored, and Iron was smithed -- were part of political strategies that
(re)negotiated access to social and symbolic resources.

This paper is an overview of the excavation of a 19th century Labrador Métis sod dwelling
structure in Southern Labrador and how this compares to previously excavated Inuit and
European structures in the region. The adoption of the Inuit style sod dwelling structure by
Europeans and Labrador Métis has complicated the ongoing debate concerning the culture

[178] Early complexity, inter-regional exchange, and the socioeconomic structure of two
highland Bolivian communities
Household-focused excavations at two villages in the Bolivian altiplano (Oruro) with pre-
Tiwanaku and Tiwanaku-contemporary occupations are used to test a model linking
incipient socioeconomic differentiation to participation in exchange and craft production. At
Condor Chinoka, imports are negatively correlated with access to preferred cuts of meat,
while at Jachakala wealth differentiation predates participation in inter-regional networks
linking Oruro and Tiwanaku. The impact of Tiwanaku goods clearly differs according to
communities’ internal socioeconomic structure; Jachakala’s physical divisions fostered
intra-group differences lacking at Condor Chinoka. These fundamental principles of social
organization may also help to explain some variability in more hierarchical societies.

constructing canals and harbors, building dams, and stimulating oil and gas production.
After the program ended, information about Plowshare projects became more difficult to
find and concerns increased regarding potential environmental liabilities on the landscape.

[73] Chorrera as a Horizon Style and Its Impact on Understanding Prehistoric Interaction
The Late Formative Period of Ecuador, dating between 1000 and 100 BC, is best known for
the Chorrera culture. The Chorrera style is often presented as a horizon style, one that
spread through much of coastal and highland Ecuador. This paper will explore the
implications of designating Chorrera as a horizon style and some of the assumptions this
designation holds for our understanding of interaction during the Late Formative Period.
The paper will suggest that, at least for parts of the Ecuadorian coast, the evidence shows
more restricted and localized ceramic stylistic homogeneity than has been proposed in the
past.

[227] What can western Mexico tell us about Formative Olman’s “international” role?
I consider several scholars’ suggestions that Formative western Mexico was an alternate
root of Mesoamerican society without close relations with Olman, by breaking down the
evidence. Distinctive architecture, ceramic, and iconographic traditions tie together
Early/Middle Formative western sites and differentiate them from eastern Mesoamerica.
Yet if we move past the criteria of shape and design, we find that mortuary traditions
suggestive of corporate groups are shared with parts of Oaxaca, and elite corporate groups
in the west participated in long distance trade networks that overlapped with those
encircling Olman. We should consider whether language was a selective barrier to
interaction.

[284] Memory and Identity within Late Prehistoric Cultures of the Susquehanna Valley
Adherence to culture historic taxonomies has stagnated research on the late prehistoric
cultures of the Northeast. Here, cultural identity is largely based on a combination of
geographic territories at Contact and ceramic types found within those territorial areas. This
approach overlooks the fluidity of individual and cultural identities and the permeability of
geographical and cultural boundaries. This research explores the potential for burial rituals,
as preserved acts of social memory, to provide a new means of understanding the late
prehistoric landscape in the Susquehanna Valley of New York and Pennsylvania.

the Tar and San Martín Lake Basins
This paper is aimed to discuss the hunter-gather occupation of Tar and San Martín lake
basins, considering the spatio-temporal distribution of the archaeological record in different
ecological units (steppe, forest, and ecotone). The occupational record locally begins at 9.6
14C ky BP, continuing in a punctuated way until historical times. The evidence suggests a
rather marginal use of the westernmost areas, which were probably logistically exploited
from population cores located eastwards. Given that the occupation of southern Patagonia
was not spatially continuous, the evidence provided here is used to discuss the process of
peopling of these and similar Andean basins.

We may not know the meaning of color in the past, but we can discover its use and
association through archaeological science. Blue colors were difficult to achieve in the
prehistoric past. The mineral vivianite may have served as one source for blue pigment in
the prehistoric Mid-Atlantic region. An interdisciplinary approach combining geology,

of blue pigments. Replicative experiments revealed techniques for maximizing the vivid
blue color of this material that could have been employed by prehistoric Native American
inhabitants of the eastern United States.

Settlement Patterns in the Durango District of Southwestern Colorado
This presentation investigates interrelationships between agriculture and prehistoric
settlement patterns throughout the Upper Animas River drainage. This analysis draws
together archaeological data, experimental agriculture, paleoclimatic reconstructions, and
settlement distributions in the Durango District of southwestern Colorado. Between A.D.
650-840 populations in the Upper Animas began to settle in villages of increasing size for
the first time in their history. Concurrently, a complex suite of runoff and dry land
subsistence agricultural techniques were developed from Ak’chin farming strategies. This
research models the changes in Ancestral Puebloan lifeways that occurred, and assesses
factors that led to early village formation.

[205] A diachronic study of the micromammal remains of Amud Cave, Israel: Implications
for the paleoecology of a Neanderthal site during MIS 4-3 in the Levant
The micromammalian assemblages from Amud Cave, a Neanderthal site in the Dead Sea
rift, Israel (70-55 kya; MIS 4-3), were analyzed from taphonomic and paleoecological
perspectives. The abundance of Microtus guentheri may reflect a taphonomic overprint
resulting from selectivity of Tyto alba as the accumulating agent rather than an indication of
open habitats. Thus, the analysis suggests the existence of a Mediterranean woodland
habitat in the site’s vicinity. The data also point to an evolutionary and ecological
persistence of the micromammal communities at the site throughout the 15 ky sequence,

More than 11,000 obsidian artifacts excavated from the Late Classic and Epiclassic period
site of Santa Cruz Atizapan, Toluca Valley, Mexico were subjected to attribute analysis,

consumption patterns were explored in order to assess the regional impact of
Teotihuacan’s demise during the Late Classic. This research produced several key results:
1) Ucareo, Michoacan obsidian (not Teotihuacan controlled sources) was primarily
imported and used in all site contexts during the Late Classic period, and 2) obsidian tools
were used almost exclusively for completing daily utilitarian tasks.

Photon Activation Analysis (PAA) is a completely non-destructive method of whole artifact

complementary technique to neutron activation analysis (NAA) and ICP-MS when sampling
is prohibited, or as an alternative to x-ray fluorescence (XRF) when the material is too
heterogeneous for superficial analysis alone. Recent experiments with samples from known
obsidian sources, as well as other volcanic materials, have demonstrated that PAA has the
ability to analyze dozens of elements simultaneously and provide data comparable to other
techniques.

[261] Network representations of cultural transmission - are they necessary?
Network analysis is increasingly used in fields as diverse as physics, biology, genetics,

network in one time frame typically becomes the basis for modeling the next time frame,
such that change only occurs with imposed modifications. Is this the best way to represent
culture transmission? More naturally fluid models offered by evolutionary theory may often
be better suited to the dynamics of cultural change. This paper will explore how these
contrasting representations may have different advantages for particular case studies.

This paper discusses an agent-based computer simulation that models variability in
leadership strategies using Blanton et al.’s (1996) “Dual Processual Theory.” In our model,
each leader is represented by a planning agent who interacts with households and
possesses a utility valuation on a set of goals. Utility valuation follows Blanton et al.’s
corporate-network axis for leadership strategies. After leaders execute plans, they re-
examine and change their utility valuation based on current success. We evaluate the
impact of several different factors on leader’s decisions to change their leadership
strategies.

When combined with other archaeological and ecological evidence from the island, the

In contrast, early Lucayan sites show fewer and less diverse foreign items. I propose that

temporal and spatial variation. Varying types of inter-island exchanges (trade, tribute,

Nearly all human action hinges on information acquired by individual learning or social
transmission. That hunter-gatherer population densities are low, and so much hunting and
gathering is solitary, has led some to argue that hunter-gatherers depend almost wholly on
individual learning guided by principles that maximize individual inclusive fitness. On that
view, socially transmitted information is untrustworthy unless accompanied by a costly
signal preventing self-interested deception. On the contrary, cheap, reliable social
transmission is likely vital to hunter-gatherers because environmental information is often
poor and because they live in socially coordinated arrangements characterized by repeated
interaction and punishment of deviance.

excavation be smoothly transferred to the safe haven of a state of the art server. Access to
the data on the server is for authorised persons only. Wider access to our excavation data
is at present under implementation, with the addition of the excavation geometry to our
ADAB-WEB (general sites and monuments data base), with a Web front end and GIS-

valley. In the 1950’s new interest seemed to appear and research was carried out in
various regions of Central and Southern Portugal, including the Sado basin and the
western Atlantic coast. Mesolithic prehistory lost interest at the end of the 20th century, but
on the last decade, southern Portugal became the new center of development of Mesolithic
research. In this paper we focus on the new results from recent research from the Tagus
valley down to the Algarve coast, during the Boreal and Atlantic phases.

[276] Rethinking the 'Neolithic' at Catalhöyük: linking East and West
Until recently, little was known about the West Mound at Catalhöyük other than that it
produced distinctive painted pottery traditionally assigned to the Early Chalcolithic.
However, the excavation of a building dated to the 59/58th century BC has revealed
differences from the East Mound, though the early dates show the West Mound was
integral to the story of Neolithic Catalhöyük. New work aims to understand the site's origins
in the Late Neolithic and how it overlapped with the East Mound. In this paper, we offer a
preliminary interpretation of the social changes and continuities between East and West.

[299] Digital Archaeology: Integration of Geographic Information System Technology in the
Archaeological Database
Current use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) by archaeologists brings attention to
needed protocols required to implement and maintain an accurate GIS. This paper
documents the strengths of GIS as a companion to traditional archaeological site files, and
highlights the complexities of maintaining both archival records and electronic databases.
Updating and correction of GIS against archival site files is a first step in maintaining
electronic databases. Maintaining archaeological databases is part of the preservation
process, requiring a dedicated position within federal, state, and private agencies to keep
up with a growing archaeological record.

Stone tools have a critical role to play in our understanding of the origins and evolution of
modern humans. In particular, the raw materials that are utilised in stone tool production
provide information relating to organisation of technology and group mobility. Using
macroscopic and petrographic analyses, lithic artifact assemblages from two rockshelter
sites, Magubike and Mlambalasi, in southwestern Tanzania are accurately characterised in
order to evaluate inter- and intra-assemblage variability. Preliminary analyses demonstrate
a considerable range in raw material variability for the Middle Stone Age, in comparison to
the Later Stone Age, assemblages.

[173] The ethnoarchaeology of fire-stick farming in Indigenous Australia
Among Mardu hunter-gatherers in Australia's Western Desert, reliance on traditional foods

that the result is best described as a "woman's" landscape: a fine-grained mosaic in which
key resources are available within daily foraging range of residential bases. Differences
between fire-managed and unmanaged landscapes may be detectable archaeologically
through isotopic analysis of faunal remains. We assess this possibility in a pilot study of hill

[175] Comparing the northward and southward spread of maize
New evidence for the antiquity of maize’s initial spread northwards and southwards from
the RÃo Balsas region of western Mexico suggests differences in the timing and
mechanisms for its movement in each direction. The northward spread into northern
Mexico and the US Southwest may have been partly related to population movement while
the southward spread into southern Mexico and beyond may have been the result of down-
the-line exchange and borrowing. Recent radiocarbon dates, DNA, and plant fossil
analyses suggest maize’s adoption was early in both regions but the initial reasons for its
adoption may have been quite different.

productivity would decrease with distance from Ceren, but our findings suggest otherwise.
Within the first survey grid at the crest of a hill, another plot of land may have once

[100] Niche Construction Theory, Agricultural Origins and the Search for Fit Domesticates
Niche construction theory is well suited for consideration of the ecological dynamism
associated with the origins of agriculture. As a constructed niche, agriculture changed
human behaviors and crop species in ways that drew them closer together. Jomon Japan
suggests that human manipulation of plants and animals was well developed among early
Holocene hunting/gatherers. Agriculture may have resulted not from human developments,
but when some plants and animals responded to such human investments in ways that let
them command human attention. Species that succeeded in this can be considered fit
domesticates.

[143] Human presence in Europe during the Younger Dryas: landscape use and species
exploitation from radiocarbon dated material
The Younger Dryas (GS1) shows a contraction of human population compared with the
preceding Interstadial (GI-1). Although dates on proxy evidence for humans remain
constant, direct radiocarbon dates on human remains decrease. It is argued that this can
be linked both to a changing seasonal round and to cultural changes. There is a reduction
in the diversity of species exploited during GS1, with a greater reliance on reindeer.
Furthermore, there are indications of a more limited number of dated artefact types,
especially when compared with the following Holocene period, in which species diversity,
artefact type and spatial distribution increase dramatically.

The islands of Trinidad and Tobago formed separate sociopolitical, economic, cultural, and

[291] Bioarchaeological Research In Argentina: Past, Present and Future
In this paper, we discuss the theoretical approaches that have shaped osteological studies
in Argentina over the past several decades. Initially, human remains were used as sources
of typological analysis; however, osteological research has become increasingly grounded
in modern bioarchaeological techniques and interpreted within theories of social
dimensions of mortuary behavior. While this evolution parallels changes in the field
elsewhere, some bioarchaeological studies in Argentina still use inappropriate samples and
methods which led to biased data analysis, and overly simplistic interpretations. We explore
the geopolitical and sociocultural forces that have shaped bioarchaeology in Argentina.

[186] Vlasac re-opened: Mortuary complexity and Mesolithic-Neolithic transformations in
the Danube Gorges
The paper presents new excavations at the Mesolithic-Neolithic site of Vlasac in the
Danube Gorges. A number of complex and diverse burial practices, both extended
inhumations and cremations, were encountered that span the period from the Late
Mesolithic through the Middle Neolithic with an apparent continuity in the sequence. New
excavations also revealed evidence of changes in mortuary customs and the treatment of
the body in the crucial period of Mesolithic-Neolithic transformation. Such evidence sheds
light on the character of culture change that took varied forms across the Balkans in the
late 7th mil. BC.

[86] Food from a Late Neolithic House in Southeast Europe
A large quantity of well preserved plant macro remains have been retrieved from a house at
site of Vinca, Serbia, providing evidence for food processing in the late Neolithic. The
remains consist primarily of charred emmer and vetches and were concentrated around a
grinding stone found within the house. Exceptional finds include a large quantity of
mineralized brittle emmer chaff scattered in a layer above the floor. Charred whole fruits of
pears and plums were also retrieved. The new discovery provides the first direct evidence
allowing reconstruction of food supplies and preparation within a Vinca house, ca. 6000
years old.

Another interpretation based on the existence of supra-regional safety nets for both

discuss those atypical human aggregations. An archaeological discussion based on the

INAA of 286 ceramics from 26 sites in central Lydia, ranging from Early Bronze to Iron Age,
augment macro-scale analyses of paste, fabric and surface treatment. Combined with

[139] Vegetal Microfossils Analysis in Dental Calculus from Brazilian Shellmonds
Microfossils originating from plant foods become trapped in dental calculus. Chemical
processing of dental calculus allows extraction of these microfossils. Resulting data allow
reconstruction of diet and vegetal use from past populations, especially in sites where
macro botanical remains are barely preserved. Since there are cases in which the calculus
deposits are insufficient, a technique called “dental wash” was developed and tested.
Additionally dental calculus microfossils from humans excavated in a coastal (Jabuticabeira

As part of an ongoing research project, “The Social Archaeology of Food at the Origins of
Agriculture”, this paper focuses on two issues. First, the Early Natufian predates the
appearance of agriculture by almost 3000 years, and so should be studied in its own right
as a particular set of social practices and traditions rather than as a direct, causally linked

including knapper intention. It is clear that we do not share a common production concept.
Evaluation of this is based on width to thickness ratios of replicas compared to a large

[36] Crossing the Furry Divide: The Archaeology and Historical Ecology of California
Channel Island Sea Mammals
Archaeologists have long noted that pinnipeds and sea otters were important dietary and
raw material resources for hunter-gatherers on California’s Channel Islands. Faunal
evidence for their exploitation, however, is limited until about 1500 years ago with
assemblages typically containing Guadalupe fur seals, California sea lions, and smaller
amounts of other otariids, phocids, and sea otters. Contrary to zooarchaeological evidence,
the identification of sophisticated Early and Middle Holocene hunting tools and modern

abundances.

Most archaeological models of how past band societies used information to adapt to long-

fluctuating resources. This paper contributes to a general model of the importance of
information acquisition, use and sharing in hunter-gatherer societies by comparing and

Rather than focus on ethnicity, archaeologists and ethnohistorians should focus on the

[195] Why authenticity matters but provenience doesn't: problems with inscribed Biblical
artifacts
The authenticity of important Biblical artifacts such as the James Ossuary (allegedly an
early reference to Jesus) and the Joash Inscription (said to be material proof of the
existence of the second Temple) has recently become the subject of intense academic
debate. This has resulted in an intensified scrutiny of Near Eastern archaeological
inscriptions and an increase in questions of authenticity. Far less attention has been paid to
the possible archaeological contexts of these artifacts or to the means of their discovery
and trade. This paper examines why for some scholars questions of authenticity
overshadow those of provenience.

[153] Settlement patterns and social complexity in the Bronze Age of La Mancha, Spain
Settlement pattern analysis of the Bronze Age sites found during the Albacete project in the
La Mancha region of southeast Spain show a segmented society on the verge of
developing stratification. These sites are roughly contemporary to the Argaric and
Valenciano "cultures", and show a different type of social pattern that is more egalitarian.
Comparison of these La Mancha Bronze Age with its better known contemporaries can
provide insight into the factors influencing the development of complex social hierarchies
and the state in southeast Spain.

[152] Spatial Distribution of Shellfish and Shellfish Harvesting on Santa Cruz Island: An
Ecological and Archaeological Perspective
Santa Cruz Island’s shores span an oceanographic gradient from warmer to colder water.
In a complementary approach between coastal archaeology and intertidal ecology we
compare work done in Santa Cruz Island over the past decades. We test the null
hypothesis that patterns of composition of shellfish species from the current intertidal and
the shell middens nearby should be similar implying a non-selective harvesting strategy.
Our results present a partial disagreement between ecologic and archaeological shellfish
abundance and diversity which rejects the null hypothesis. These differences may arise
from different oceanographic conditions in the past or changing harvesting strategies
(selective harvesting).

[128] A Geospatial Analysis of Hydrothermal Features in Alaska and Implications for Trans-
Beringian Migration
Recent work around Ushki Lake, Kamchatka, suggests that trans-Beringian migration was
influenced by hydrothermal landscape features. Through GIS, landscape features can be
examined for associations with prehistoric sites dating to the time of transcontinental
migration. To analyze this association a geodatabase including a digital elevation model for
Alaska, hot springs, and sites reliably dated to earlier than 10,500 YBP was created.
Statistical analysis shows a possible association between these ancient sites and hot
springs. This implies that hot springs contributed to migration and settlement of people in
Beringia, and illustrates the importance of geospatial analysis in early migration research.

[149] Origins of Modern African Diversity: Archaeological and Genetic Perspectives
The dense and spectacular archaeological record of southern Africa during the Middle

Pleistocene isolating event. Genetic data on archaic mtDNA lineages among the San have
led to a similar conclusion. Here we present a different view, arguing for more complex

[100] Evolutionary Ecology and Niche Construction Theory in Archaeology
Evolutionary ecology (EE) is a theoretical framework that has been widely applied to
problems in human evolution and prehistory. Applications range from early hominin
morphology, to agriculture, to the emergence of social complexity. With a focus on how
behavioral adjustments to changing socio-ecological conditions create novel selective
pressures that in turn drive other changes in morphology and behavior, these applications
draw on the same evolutionary logic that underlies Niche Construction Theory (NCT). We
illustrate the synergies between EE and NCT with a range of empirical applications and
explore how using these approaches together can advance understanding of the human
past.

The commonly held view in northern Europe is that the transition from Mesolithic hunter-

This assumption is tested through analysis of a Danish flint tool assemblage, which was

Interestingly, marginality can also “produce” economically and ideologically independent

[70] From Archaeology to CSI: Applications in Forensic Palynology
Initial training in archaeology and botany are ideal backgrounds for pollen studies in

its geographic specificity. Each plant species produces unique pollen. The distinctive
ecology of an area yields a “pollen print” similar to the unique fingerprints in humans. When
used as a forensic tool, pollen studies can link a weapon, vehicle, or suspect to a crime
scene; determine the specific location of a crime; indicate the season when a crime
occurred, and can be used decades later to solve “cold cases” once thought unsolvable.

Floraturbation is one of the most common postdepositional processes, affecting all but the
rarest of archaeological sites. The main kinds of floraturbation are windthrow, tree sway,
root growth and root decay. Field research investigating windthrow (the uprooting of trees)

The effect windthrow has on the archaeological record is directly linked to the type of
windthrow created. Moreover, the different windthrow signatures can be used to reconstruct

Butchery intensity is an important yet elusive property of zooarchaeological samples.
Appropriately assessing changes in butchery intensity, as the amount of energy expended
in processing a typical animal carcass, provides the opportunity to make strong theoretical
and empirical connections between resource availability, ecology, and human behavior.
The major limitation is the development of an appropriate measure of intensity that can be
generalized across a wide range of assemblages with unique taphonomic histories and
documentation protocols. Here we develop a potential macroscopic measure of butchery
intensity and evaluate its utility with computer simulations and empirical testing in two large
zooarchaeological samples.

what role did the branches play and how did this activity reflect trends in the northern Puget
Sound Basin at that time.

[107] The Relationship between Relic Hunters and Professional Archaeologists on the
Lower Columbia River in the early 20th Century
The extent of relic hunting that occurred on the lower Columbia River in the first half of the
20th century is staggering. While current ethics condemn such action, many professionals
working at the time supported relic hunter organizations, even while individuals were
amassing large personal collections and looting archaeological sites. The entangled
relationship between professionals and so-called amateurs is one our profession tends to
downplay, yet such “dirty secrets” are important to review since they likely contribute to
lingering public perception that archaeology is artifact collecting, and explain why some
Native Americans and First Nations people still mistrust professional archaeology.

[161] Quantifying inter-site economic variability in Neolithic Cyprus
While we have begun to document variation among Neolithic sites on Cyprus, we are still a

important variables—the size and geographical situation of sites, aspects of land use,
animal husbandry, resource procurement, tool production, food processing, and storage—
which can be to some degree quantified and subjected to statistical analysis. Such analysis
demonstrates a wider range of economic strategies than has generally been attributed to
early village societies in this part of the eastern Mediterranean. These strategies responded
to both ecological and social pressures.

[95] Employing Geometric Morphometrics to Assess Morphologic Variability in Butchery
Tools
Stone tool edge-wear analysis can relay important information regarding implement
operation and employment, each of which is useful for elucidating site-use. However,
differences in the edge morphology of similar tools used for analogous activities may
deviate depending on raw material, as variability in quality can potentially affect a stone
tool’s effectiveness and overall use-life. Applying Geometric Morphometrics, this study
quantifies the morphological variability between unmodified flake tools made of multiple raw
materials, after use in various stages of experimental butchery, to account for how these
factors may indeed inform on aspects of prehistoric behavior as inferred from the
archaeological record.

[214] Holocene Seasonality and Artiodactyl Population Histories in Western North America
We test a hypothesis that the seasonality of temperature and precipitation conditioned the
population densities of artiodactyls across the Holocene of western North America. We use
a climate simulation to derive trans-Holocene indices of intra-annual temperature range,
summer precipitation, and winter precipitation. These indices are arrayed against a
paleontological record of fecal pellet densities, and archaeological records of artiodactyl
bone counts and hunting tools. Each of these records correlate with the seasonality indices
and suggest that artiodactyls occurred in low densities from the terminal Pleistocene
through the middle Holocene, while substantial increases occurred during equable,
summer-wet periods of the late Holocene.

[16] Problems with “Prestige Goods”: Inalienable Possessions and Polychrome Pottery in
the Holmul Region, Guatemala
The elite exchange of polychrome pottery in the Maya area formed an integral part of
intersite alliance building. Previous studies of stylistic and compositional variables suggest
a number of polychrome distribution networks existed during the Late Classic period.
However, archaeologists have been reticent to classify these networks separately or
collectively as traditional prestige goods systems. This paper discusses problems with
applying the prestige goods model to understand ancient Maya polychrome production and
consumption patterns. The application of the concept of “Inalienable Possessions” will be
discussed as a viable alternative using pottery from the Holmul Region, Guatemala.

other animals. The latter prediction is directly confirmed in the animal behavior.

Salvador
Immediate post-contact changes in ceramic production and consumption by Mesoamerican
inhabitants of early sixteenth-century San Salvador are evidence for early sixteenth-century
indigenous ethnogenesis within the Spanish Empire. Highly localized intrasite and
household ceramic production gave way to a new community mode formed during the first
generation of Spanish colonization of Central America. The creation of a hybrid serving
vessel was also a significant part of this new community mode, and in comparison with
similar cases in North America, suggests a relationship between involuntary migration and
rapid culture change. This evidence suggests a model of subculture ethnogenesis within
colonial Mesoamerica.

Relative to other periods, there are very few recorded sites of middle Holocene age in
Mendoza Province, Argentina. Rather than population diminution or regional abandonment
triggered by climatic conditions, however, this may reflect changing patterns of land use.
This paper tests archaeological data against the predictions of Charnov’s marginal value
theorem and a model of lithic raw material procurement in an attempt to better understand

[30] Searching for a 'Place' to Call Home: Colonization of the western Great Lakes
Landscape
Situating cultural knowledge and practices within a known physical landscape is a common
trait among many hunter-gatherer communities, and operate as key strategies to maintain
traditional environmental knowledge(s) across generations. However, among populations
colonizing unfamiliar regions such practices have become uprooted from the physical
landscape. This paper assess the suggestion that elements of the western Great Lakes
Paleoindian archaeological record may be interpreted as part of alternative strategies
serving to translocate cultural practices during periods of colonization. Such approaches
would help ensure the successful learning, and by extension the successful colonization, of
new frontiers by Paleoindians.

[148] The Miami Circles and the Prehistoric Settlement System of the Miami River
Recent archaeological investigations in downtown Miami have uncovered evidence
demonstrating the extent and chronology of prehistoric habitation and mortuary sites on
both sides of the Miami River. This site is the largest prehistoric complex in Southeast
Florida encompassing an area of over 15,000 square meters. Characterized by constructed
mounds, solution hole mortuaries, and a large village; the site was occupied for at least
2500 years and was known as the town of Tequesta during the Spanish Period. Also
discussed are the two Miami Circles, characterized by postholes and basins cut into the
bedrock.

[292] The first hunter-gatherers on the central Chilean coast: adaptations and climate
change
The archaeological site Punta Ñague (10ka to 8.5ka) was identified as a large habitational
settlement of the preceramic culture Huentelauquen, which shows very early a strong
maritime adaptation. Mollusk gathering seasonality was studied using bivalve growth line
structures, providing insights into the seasonal resource exploitation strategies and the
human group mobility patterns. Central Chile underwent dramatic climatic changes, from
humid conditions during the deglaciation to an extremely arid phase in the mid-Holocene.
Interactions between environmental changes and the Huentelauquen cultural evolution was
studied through a multidisciplinary approach combining geomorphology, palynology, and
shell stable isotopes.

[276] From Sourcing to ‘the Social’: Re-Humanizing Characterization Studies
While sourcing studies have been very successful in terms of artifact-material

engaging with debates upon the ‘social’. Drawing on characterization studies of
Çatalhöyük’s obsidian and other siliceous materials, this paper attempts to re-humanize our
data at two different scales. The first considers the experiences associated with the
procurement of these resources, while the second examines to what extent our knowledge
of artifact-material place of origin may have been appreciated – and meaningfully employed
- by those handling them on a daily basis at Çatalhöyük.

[264] Empire Building and Religious Conversion in the Archaeological Record
Governments often employ religious rhetoric and directives in order to administer diverse
peoples and suppress opposition. This kind of control has both societal implications and
connotations for religious identity. The Carolingian Empire (c. AD 750 – 890) is one
example of such a government. Confronted with continual ‘pagan’ resistance, the
Carolingians not only established severe penalties for those accused of being pagan, but
also decreed aspects of ‘good’ Christian burial. This paper will investigate such religious
rhetoric by examining burial customs not only in the heart of the Empire, but also in the
hotly contested regions of Carolingian control.

[182] Ethnoarchaeology and the African Diaspora
West Africa has had a long and dynamic history of ethnoarchaeological research, providing
Africanist archaeologists with valued, if indirect, analogical bridges into prehistory.
Archaeologists of the African Diaspora do not appear to have made much use of the
growing ethnoarchaeological record, relying instead on ethnographies, historical accounts
and traveler’s tales that are notoriously short on information that is useful to archaeologists.
Ethnoarchaeology emphases the relationship between material, thought and action and
therefore has considerable potential to provide insight into the material remains of enslaved
peoples of West African descent.

Three sediment cores were collected from wetlands in Trinidad, adjacent to documented
archaeological sites along the west-central and southwestern coasts of the island. One of
these continuously deposited sediment cores near the early Archaic site of St. John
produced a detailed paleoenvironmental sequence and ample evidence of past human
activity. Human behavior recorded in the core includes settlement occupation, forest
clearing and burning, and site abandonment with subsequent forest regeneration.
Agriculture may also be represented in the core as well as economically significant taxons

such as chert, obsidian and fine-grained basalt and we appreciated a shift from chert to
obsidian use, related to a more sedentary pattern in the early Holocene occupation.

[260] Dual Northern Tutchone Trading Strategies: Evidence from Fort Selkirk, Yukon
Previous research suggests sub-arctic aboriginal groups in direct contact with fur traders
were quickly integrated into the fur trade sphere with partial or total dependence on the
trading posts being the inevitable outcome. At the time of HBC contact at Fort Selkirk (mid-
1940s) the Athapaskan speaking Northern Tutchone were already part of a dynamic trade
network with the Coastal Tlingit Chilkat. This was due partly to established pre-contact
trade networks and contact period fur trade competition. Written and archaeological
evidence from Fort Selkirk suggests that the early fur trade of central Yukon does not fit the
dependency model of contact.

[43] The Role of Obsidian at Zacpetén, El Petén, Guatemala
In general, Postclassic obsidian artifacts suggest a dominant reliance on the Ixtepeque
source. However, an analysis of 262 obsidian samples from Zacpetén demonstrates that
obsidian from El Chayal was utilized as frequently as that from Ixtepeque. When compared
to obsidian frequencies at other central Petén Postclassic archaeological sites, such as
Trinidad de Nosotros and Topoxté Island, we suggest that a different trade pattern exists in
central Petén than that hypothesized for Belize and the Yucatán Peninsula. When these
obsidian data are compared to ceramic evidence, central Petén emerges as another
distinct economic core during the Postclassic period.

During the early years of the conquest, several Spaniards visited the Moquegua Valley to
resolve conflicts among local indigenous elites. These conflicts arouse due to the
Spaniards failure to clearly understand the political organization of indigenous communities
of the southern Andes. Intermediate elites were institutionalized or placed by the Inka
government according to imperial interests and local traditions. Under the new colonial
order, less powerful local leaders envisioned new opportunities to claim leadership over
some parcialidades, probably a previously unattainable right. This paper explores how
different Colesuyo intermediate elites used different strategies according to newly imposed

response to an influx of immigrants into the neighboring Rio Abajo region. Change in
architecture and ceramic decorative style, coinciding with the transition from dispersed
settlements to plaza-oriented pueblos, reveals a new scale of social mobilization and
identity as Salinas populations responded to cultural difference through symbolic

developing two distinct methods for the production of iron. Rather than being tightly bound
to tradition, medieval ironmasters actively engaged their economy with novel ideas and

because the diagnostic ceramics-majolicas, colonial red wares-are absent from their

[60] Paleoenvironments and the Early Human Occupation of the Puget Sound Region
During the last 5000 years of prehistory, since oceanic conditions stabilized and forests
closed in, human settlements were concentrated along Puget Sound’s rivers and
shorelines. Older settlements are much more topographically widespread and less
intuitively predictable, occupying upland benches, kettle lakes, and other historically
undesirable habitats. This difference is partly attributable to marked changes in climate and
the dependent composition and distribution of plant communities. This paper addresses
what is known about postglacial terrestrial environments of the region and explores how
differences in the seasonal distribution and intensities of insolation and precipitation
translated into resource distributions in time and space.

[226] Wild or domesticated? Water Buffalo in Early China
Using archaeological, zooarchaeological, DNA, ethnohistorical and ethnographic data, this
paper discusses human exploitation of wild buffaloes and their extinction in early China,
and investigates the origins of domestic buffaloes. We argue that domestic buffaloes were
most likely introduced from South Asia around the beginning of the first millennium AD, and
the Bubalus Mephistopheles was a wild species, as manifest in water buffalo images from
the Shang and Zhou periods although it was long considered as a species domesticated
indigenously in China. These findings have implications for understanding the history of
cultural contact between ancient China and South Asia.

The excavation in 2003 by Shandong University at the Shang Period site of Daxinzhuang,
Shandong, China has collected many different types of plants. My research examines
carbonized seeds and fruits from about 200 flotation samples. It is demonstrated that
people had multiple cropping of foxtail and broomcorn millets, rice, wheat, soybean and

Watershed, Michigan
The diversity and complexity of foraging strategies used by hunter gatherers (hg)
demonstrate their skills for coping with changing environmental and social conditions. I
examine the relationship between such conditions in the Saginaw Watershed and hg
decision making. I explore the role of spatial variation to assess the effects of biotic and

predict and interpret forager habitat and resource choices. A complex relationship exists
between hg subsistence and available resources: hg select resources differently based on
alternative habitats and patches in different environmental and social contexts.

[267] Producers, Consumers, and Traders: Lithic Industries at Cerros and Chau Hiix, Belize
Ancient Maya communities in Belize are generally classified as producers or consumers of
lithic artifacts, based on the idea that groups either specialized in the production of these
artifacts or in their use. In reality, it is difficult to divide communities into just these two
categories. Most communities contained both producers and consumers, and the
middlemen, the traders. In fact, many households within communities switched between
these roles at different times and as they used different raw materials. This paper looks for
evidence of producers, consumers and traders in the lithic industries of Cerros and Chau
Hiix.

that were part of the Mesoamerican Religious Tradition. Parallels with Chichen Itza and

Reduced domestic habitation of long-term coastal sites is readily confirmed, but a
concurrent increase in diverse smaller sites indicates settlement reorganization, rather than
wholesale abandonment. Direct dates on mortuary remains indicate continued use of long-

[248] The Persistence of the Huayras in Southern Bolivia: A Case for Evolution or
Immobility?
The southern Bolivian Andes has been a major metal producing region since pre-Hispanic
periods. Over the last 500 years the area has shown a diverse and variable metallurgical
history. There is little archaeological or historical evidence regarding the types of
metallurgical methods used by pre-Hispanic people. The study of archaeological (colonial)
and current day huayras, wind blown furnaces that have Andean origins, indicate a case for
evolving technology. Archaeo-metallurgical analyses of huayra remains have shown that
these furnaces were not technologically immobile. Sociological, political and economic
factors have stimulated variation in the technological function and style.

[143] What was the impact of the Younger Dryas on hunter-gatherer populations in China
and surrounding East Asia?
Recent paleoclimatic research and archaeological research in East Asia are shedding new
light on the Pleistocene - Holocene transition in the region. This paper examines how the
Younger Dryas (ca. 11-10,000 bp uncalibrated) possibly affected human populations
(hunter-gatherer groups) across the region and whether Younger Dryas effects were
somehow a "push" toward the incipient or early Neolithic cultures that appear in the
archaeological record, particularly in China, during the early Holocene.

The Late Archaic period (4500-3000 B. P.) of the southeastern coastal United States is

investigations have been conducted at several of these sites, questions remain regarding
the formation of these deposits. Vertebrate data from recent excavations at St. Catherines
Shell Ring (9Li231), St. Catherines Island, Georgia, indicate that vertebrate remains at the

of oxygen isotopes from hardhead catfish (Ariopsis felis) provides new information about
how vertebrates were deposited at these sites.

[233] The Social Construction of Kingship in the Usumacinta Region
Against the common notion of a homogeneous Maya area this paper will demonstrate
hitherto not identified fundamental differences in the perception of kingship in the southern
Maya lowlands, highlighting the Usumacinta region. Analyzing key rhetorics and metaphors
this paper shows how Usumacinta kings consciously chose a path of rule that differed from
their central Peten counterparts choosing a less exalted and divine status. This different
approach stems from a fundamentally different social structure in the Usumacinta drainage.
Kingship is always a social construction and the result of regional and community
interaction.

Although compositional studies of obsidian from Eastern Africa conducted during the

[261] Cultural transmission and the explanation of similarities among archaeological

Network methods are often used to understand the distribution of similarities and
differences among archaeological assemblages. In such analyses it is commonplace to
assume that similarities are the result of either vertical or horizontal transmission. Here, we
outline a study whose results suggest that this assumption is problematic and should be
avoided. The study focused on craft learning in Iranian tribal populations, and used a novel
combination of ethnographic fieldwork and cladistic analyses to investigate how the
processes through which individual weavers learn and share their knowledge relate to the
development of group-level similarities and differences in woven material culture.

[112] The Darts of Dawn: The Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli Venus Complex in the Iconography of
Mesoamerica and the American Southwest
Since the late 19th Century, Eduard Seler and others recognized that the Late Postclassic
Central Mexican deity, Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli "the God of Dawn", embodied Venus as the
Morning Star. With roots in Early Postclassic Toltec-related iconography, this deity is often
depicted as a skeletal star god shooting darts. A closely related ritual complex emphasized
fertility and warfare and was centered upon stars, feathered serpents, and celestial darts.
This study examines this complex in the art of ancient Central and West Mexico and relates
it to strikingly similar motifs in Pueblo IV kiva murals and rock art in the American
Southwest.

Semi-subterranean pit houses are one of the more identifiable cultural traits identified within

representation of gender distinctions in both the highlands and the coast from the pre
imperial times to Huari’s fluorescence.

approach, I test if hunting and butchering/processing strategies reflect adaptations to
geographically-dependent environmental conditions. Specifically, I explore how spatially
variable requirements for essential nutrients mediated prehistoric foraging decisions.

As in ancient Maya visual culture, the consideration of gender in contemporary Latino/a art

Northwest Coast scholars have been preoccupied with the study of hierarchy in the

archaeological evidence of household organization, an inter-regional comparative analysis
shows that communalism was not emphasized to the same extent among all Northwest
Coast societies. Perhaps surprisingly, the strongest evidence for communalism is found in
Northwest Coast societies that are also known to have been most hierarchical. This

[272] The ancient metallurgy during the Early Bronze age in the southern part of the
CAUCASUS: recent results from excavations and survey in Western Azerbaijan
Recent franco-Azerbaijan excavations of kurgans at Soyuq Bulaq has permitted to
underline the beginnings of metallurgy in the Caucasus. In two kurgans, many metal
objects have been discovered. They illustrate the high level of manufacturing metallurgy of
the 1st of the IVth millennium in this area. Indeed, the joint analytical project between the
laboratories of Bochum and Bakou has clearly demonstrated the sophisticated techniques
of the manufacture of these artefacts. Analyses prove the use of an uncommon alloy –
auriferous silver. A survey is planned soon in several districts in order to define the origin of
the ores used.

[215] Storage and Organization in a Chalcolithic Village: Micromorphology at Tel Tsaf,
Israel
Four years of excavation at the Chalcolithic site of Tel Tsaf, Israel has uncovered a number
of circular, paved mud-brick structures. These structures are present during all excavated
occupation phases. Preliminary interpretation suggests that these structures were storage
silos. They are found in association with either circular or rectangular buildings in courtyard
structures. During the 2007 season, one of the multi-phase 'silos' was sectioned, and a full
sequence of micromorphology samples taken. The section was almost one metre in height
with evidence of multiple floor and fill levels. The results of the micromorphological analysis
will be discussed.

[134] Talking Heads and the Grateful Dead: unpacking the meaning of trophy heads at

Depictions of severed human heads in Tiwanaku art and iconography suggest that the
taking of trophy heads was an integral part of Tiwanaku warfare and/or ritual violence. In
this paper I address the question: Why were heads taken (as opposed to some other body
part)? I will argue that targeted forms of violence, such as the taking of trophy heads at
Tiwanaku, can only be understood in terms of the meaning of the human body vis-a-vis
culturally specific notions of the self and the social person, in addition to beliefs about
cycles of life, death, and social reproduction.

[300] Museums on Display: The Civic Museums of Northern Italy between Past and
Present
The second half of the 19th century witnessed the foundation of several Civic Museums in
northern Italy. From the beginning, museums in Bologna, Modena and Reggio Emilia were
established to document the history and cultural identity of their communities with an
emphasis on local archaeological material. Today, these museums still fulfill their role as
cultural mediators for local communities despite the decision to maintain the original
displays of their archaeological collections -- displays which offer a unique view of 19th
century museum practices. This paper examines how these museums preserve their
institutional past, while serving the public in the present.

[277] Reassessing the Classic to Epiclassic Transition at Cerro Portezuelo, Basin of Mexico
In the 1950s, when the Basin of Mexico ceramic sequence was poorly known, Cerro
Portezuelo pottery seemed to have good evidence of a transition from terminal Teotihuacan
to a full-blown Epiclassic complex. Re-examination of the data in light of more recent
knowledge confirms that Teotihuacan-style ceramics are abundant there, but little of the
Epiclassic complex can plausibly be derived from Teotihuacan antecedents, and much of it
has more likely sources outside the Basin. A transitional complex remains elusive. The
case for significant Epiclassic migration into the Basin of Mexico gains additional support
from Cerro Portezuelo data.

Suffolk and Wicken Bonhunt in Essex adjusted their husbandry strategies in response to
the rise of the emporia and to the demands of the changing political structure of Anglo-

Though understanding the development of complexity requires knowledge of early cultural

Archaic-Formative transitional households from the sites of Pirco and Jiskairumoko, in the
Rio Ilave. Excavations were recorded by photomapping, and dated by 30 radiocarbon
assays. Activity areas were defined by unconstrained clustering of artifact distributions.
These analyses revealed changes in: structure shape and spacing, storage, hearthside
activity performance, kitchen furniture, external cooking facilities, and processing areas.
Together, these trends indicate decreasing inter-household sharing and imply the
development of greater inter-household economic independence at the onset of the
Formative.

Monumental construction begins in the Norte Chico region shortly after 3000 BCE. Recent
excavations show near-continuous construction and remodeling of mound structures, while
there is no evidence of craft specialization. Construction and wholesale remodeling
provided a context for social gathering, feasting, a focus for ritual activity, exchange of
resources. The continual building efforts on large ceremonial structures specifically suggest
a ritual context was used to attract participants. However, cumulative large structures
fostered centralized decision making as they grew to monumental proportions and
coordination of labor became increasingly complex. This pattern of centralization expanded
over time to include formalized site layouts.

North Pacific marine mammals
Comprehensive analysis of pinniped remains from a site in the Eastern Aleutians (Amaknak
Bridge UNL050) documents profound changes to sea ice extent in the Bering Sea during
the Neoglacial (ca. 4700-2500 BP). Our archaeozoological analysis focused particularly on
determining species for arctic phocid postcranial remains and estimating ages for all young
juveniles. We conclude that Neoglacial increases in sea ice extent inferred from this
analysis must have had a profound impact on the distribution of all Bering Sea marine
mammals but explains especially the mid-Holocene establishment of northern fur seal
breeding rookeries along the west coast of North America.

stream channels; stone-lined seeps; and, terraces or soil-retention structures excavated
into bedrock. Preliminary data suggest the soil-retention structures were excavated before
~AD 500, and began to accumulate colluvium after ~AD 880, consistent with declining elite
resource management at Uxbenká’s abandonment.

Within European prehistory, food storage practices are mainly associated with the large-

methodologies including the use of caches. Through a series of hazelnut and acorn storage

The results from these experiments demonstrate that the small-scale storage of nuts in

Pedregal, a Late Intermediate Period village in the Jequetepeque Valley, were shaped by
local strategies as well as wider political and ecological imperatives. I suggest that Chim
imperial strategies in the Jequetepeque were only one of multiple forces to which
household organization responded.

[12] Modeling Ancestral Hopi Agricultural Landscapes: Applying Ethnography to
Archaeological Interpretations
In this paper, historic Hopi ethnographic data are employed to model ancestral Hopi
agricultural land use through the lens of archaeological landscape theory. The model
constructed integrates the physical, social organizational, ritual/ceremonial, and traditional
history dimensions of historic Hopi agricultural land use and suggests durable,
archaeologically-visible, material correlates thereof. This holistic model is applied to
archaeological data from the Homol’ovi Ruins State Park (HRSP), northeastern Arizona.
The integrative model allows for the interpretation of relationships between archaeological
features representing different land use behaviors and the conceptualization of linkages
between landmarks in the ancestral Hopi agricultural landscape.

[225] The Spirit Bird Cave Model and the Interpretation of Ballroom Cave, Southeast Utah
The Spirit Bird Cave paradigm, in which emergence cosmology and sacred landscape play
important roles in the validation of Puebloan centers, will be used to interpret a large
sandstone alcove located in southeastern Utah. Known locally as Ballroom Cave, the site
contains extensive modifications yet shows limited evidence of habitation. The importance
of the cave is further reflected in architecture that appears to have functioned ceremonially.
Current data suggest that the site may have served as a major religious shrine and meeting
place for the nearby prehistoric settlements of the Comb, Butler and Cottonwood
drainages.

[308] A Geoarchaeological Examination of the St. Louis Site: Reconstructing Landscape
and Vegetation through Multiple Proxy Indicators
The St. Louis site, located along the South Saskatchewan River, Canada, is a multiple
component site consisting of stratified weakly developed soils marking periods of reduced
deposition, episodic stability, and human occupation. The human occupation at the St.
Louis site spans the Paleoindian to Middle Prehistoric periods, a time poorly represented
archaeologically on the Northern Plains. This study employs sediment, stable isotope,
microstratigraphic, and phytolith evidence to reconstruct the prehistoric landscape and
vegetation of the site. A combination of geologic, environmental, and cultural data offers
insight into human occupation of the region during a period of presumed environmental
variability.

[142] Contact in the Longue Duree: Archaeological Practice and the Colonial Legacy of
Contact
The use of the term "contact" often creates an image of short-term encounters between
different cultures. As a result our corresponding research focuses on the relatively brief
period of time just before and shortly after initial contact. In the context of North America,
however, “contact” almost always occurred within a colonial framework and these colonial
encounters created long-term entanglements that lasted far beyond initial contact. Using
research along the Columbia River, I argue that we should expand our view of “contact
archaeology” to include the long-standing effects of colonial encounter, including how
colonialism is manifest in current day archaeological practice.

Since the beginning of colonial history, western science has dominated archaeology with
western knowledge structures. Indigenous archaeologists are a new aspect to the lens of

[11] Digital Image Processing of Shell Temper Variability in Late Prehistoric Ceramics]
The method employed in this study provides an economic and accurate method for
obtaining quantitative measurements on the shape, size, density, and orientation of shell
temper in prehistoric ceramics. Using a digital microscopic camera and digital image
processing software, variability of shell temper in sherds from seven different sites in the
Lower Mississippi River Valley is analyzed. Digitally processing images of the matrices of
the sherds allowed us to isolate the shell temper particles and measure variability in shell
temper size, shape, orientation, and density which were used as a measure of ceramic
technology, style and function. Results from analyzing shell temper in this fashion show a
correlation between temper size, density, and vessel wall thickness. Temper orientation
and stylistic variability in decorated sherds across assemblages are shown to exhibit similar
patterns.

[15] Early Twentieth Century O’odham Migration and Population Reorganization: An
Archaeological Perspective
The socio-political underpinnings of the Yaqui Diaspora have long been recognized in the
establishment of enclave communities north of the Mexican border. Parallel migration of
O’odham into Arizona, which relied on social networks for movement onto existing
reservations, has gone relatively unnoticed. Archaeological implications of O’odham
migration are examined, including processes for translation of landscape ideologies to new
areas. Traditional O’odham song practices can be an expression of cognitive geography.
Song transformation is considered in light of archaeological evidence and oral history of
O’odham migration into the Gila River Indian Community. Ramifications for studying earlier
population reorganization are considered.

[186] The Evolution of the Projectile Points of the Early Holocene in Northern Europe:
Between Technical Tradition and Techno-Economic Necessity
The study of bone and antler projectile points, representing half of the Early Mesolithic
manufactured items, sows differences in manufacture and trends in morphology. Compared
with the rest of the industry and taking into account the anatomical parts used, these
armatures are significant enough to discuss an "industrial dynamism" in the Early
Holocene. Patterns involved in their evolution seem to be related more to a "speciation" of
the hunting gear that is probably linked to techno-economic necessities, than to an
adaptation to the recorded environmental changes.

Usually archaeologists consider that, by their complexity, the cultures developed in the

Columbia River Plateau archaeology has a history of integrating earth science approaches

a benign backdrop, a deterministic force driving functional behavioral responses, a
generator of opportunities and constraints, and as the source of selective pressures
differentially acting upon cultural variation. Unified under the bridging concept of
geoecology, we may learn how the abiotic structure and dynamics of landscapes influence
their associated biotic components relevant to human scales of time and space. Two case
studies concerning early cultural transition and the appearance of semi-sedentary village
patterns are presented.

[17] Old Questions, New Prospects: Recent Archaeological and Oral History Research in
the southern Keewatin Region of Nunavut.
The southern Keewatin region of the Canadian arctic has received little archaeological
attention, to date. This is unfortunate, as several unresolved research questions, which are
of interest to arctic archaeology, relate directly to this region. The first of these involves the
origin of the Caribou Inuit cultural pattern, which ethnographers and archaeologists
hypothesize was established by the mid 18th century. The second focuses on the broader
question of how long human societies have occupied this area, and why patterns of land
use and occupancy have changed over time. In this paper, we discuss recent
archaeological and oral history research that promises to shed new light on these important
issues. We explore how these new data are currently being used to examine the effects of
changing physical and social environments on human societies in the southern Keewatin
region over the past several thousand years.

The Brazilian sambaquis (shellmounds) represent an enduring cultural tradition very well
adapted to coastal marine environments. This long duration has been associated to stable

Catarina study area, continuously occupied between 6 to 1,5 kyBP approximately.
Incremental moundbuilding into these coastal areas is related to recurrently performed
funerary rites, integrating local group and collective memories towards mythological
ancestors. This singular social identity construction process is regularly reified by the very
act of taking part on the edification of such imposing monuments in the open landscape.

[276] Two Sides of the Same Coin: archaeological and ethnographic perspectives on
storing and sharing food at Çatalhöyük. Part II: Sharing
A less common approach to thinking about the environmental and social challenges
inherent to agricultural production examines food sharing, which provides both nutritional
reserves and equally importantly, social bonding. Like extrasomatic food storage, food
sharing links daily life to wider social issues such as household structures, community
relations, and the general scale(s) of human interaction. We integrate multiple data sets in
order to examine food sharing behavior at early agricultural Çatalhöyük. Issues of particular
interest include the sharing of animal vs. plant products and of domesticated vs. wild foods,
as well as the scales of food sharing.

[40] Everybody here is all mixed up!
This paper presents a micro-scale examination of archaeological field praxis and its impact
on archaeologists, students (foreign and indigenous), and the local communities that both
host and labor for them. It is a reflexive journey that tries to bring coherence to the multiple
registers of meaning, contradiction and transformation that have taken place during
excavations at Bosutswe in “post-colonial” Botswana. The paper discusses our interactions
with one another and our encounters with “the past” as we sought to validate, transform, or

[59] Which Came First? The Marble or the Clay?: Ulua-style Vase Production and
Precolumbian Cultural Boundaries
Most Central American archaeologists are familiar with marble vases from the Ulua Valley,
Honduras, located in the southeast Mesoamerican periphery. Just east lays northeast
Honduras, part of the northern Chibchan frontier. Here, Precolumbian potters produced
ceramic analogues to the better known Ulua marble vases. For decades there has been
speculation as to which came first, the marble or the clay. This paper presents, for the first
time, a potential solution to this longstanding mystery. Interregional interaction is also
explored to address broader theoretical considerations, specifically frontier theories, and
serves as the basis for re-evaluating traditional cultural boundary definitions.

[47] Cardinal Directionality in Maya Burials
This research investigated the use of the cardinal directions as determinants in the
placement of the body in Maya burial practices. Data was analyzed from the Maya sites of
K’axob, Belize; Cuello, Belize; and Copán, Honduras, including Gordon Phase, Rural
Copán, and Group 9N-8. Initial hypotheses proposed that the use of cardinal directionality
in placement of the body would be established through this study, and that primary
emphases would be on the directions of North and West. Results of this study revealed
primary emphases on South, North and West, with the Southern direction unexpected.

[80] The Old Ways: Cultural Persistence and Divergence in Baja California
The Baja California Peninsula is one of the most remote and ecologically distinct portions of
North America. Perhaps because of this, local indigenous traditions were rich and varied,
simultaneously exemplifying both local innovation and archaism. When geographic or
social conditions conspire to isolate populations, or force them to sever ties and networks
that connected them to others, the potential for divergent historical development emerges.
Baja California thus presents an opportunity to evaluate models which attribute cultural
shifts in the Far West at the end of the “Archaic” to climate change, population movements,
or changing interaction networks.

We examine and discuss the material world of the Greenes, viewing a particular

involved types of objects that we now regard as quite separate, but whose boundaries
during the 17th century were yet to be defined by rigid categorizations. As material likely
collected by the Greenes and their peers during explorations and trading voyages, the
material is a curious mix of old and new, familiar and foreign; identities that mirror many of
the same realities of the first generation European colonists in Rhode Island.

[139] Archaeozoology of the last hunter-gatherers in the lower Tagus Basin (Muge,

The Muge shell middens are among the most important Mesolithic sites in Western Europe.
Together they represent long periods of continuous occupation by hunter-gatherers and
have produced rich artefact, faunal assemblages and high numbers of human burials. The
archaeozoological analysis of Cabeço da Arruda, Moita do Sebastião e Cabeço da
Amoreira expands our understanding about these Mesoltihic hunter-gatherers and their
environments. The results indicate that they hunted a wide range of species with particular
emphasis on deer, wild boar and rabbit. The data suggest that year-round occupations of
the middens were possible due to the diversified and stable ecosystem.

[273] Seasonality of prehistoric fishing and mollusk collecting in the Puerto Peñasco area
Stable isotope patterns in seasonal records from shells and otoliths from the northern Gulf
of California are repeatable and predictable. On the east side of the Gulf of California the
annual cycle in oxygen isotope ratios is primarily controlled by temperature. This
temperature cycle can be used to identify the season of final growth in shells and otoliths
from midden material in the Puerto Peñasco area. Initial results indicate that mollusk
collecting and fishing activity were focused on the late fall and winter season. Collection
stopped well before the rapid increase in temperature of the early summer.

How did specialized a Tairona coastal community form and how social inequality played a
role in socio-economic change from 200BC to 1650AD? This question is answered using
two opposing scenarios. In the top-down scenario the community would be the result of an
external agent that had sufficient authority to "create" a community with the intention to
extract a highly concentrated resource, marine salt. In the alternative scenario, the bottom-
up process, the community would become specialized as a result of a slower process
product of decisions of the individuals who resided in Chengue.

After 30 years of inactivity, excavations were taken up again at the Neolithic sites of

Although they are all produced out off small flint pebbles, morphologically they can be
divided into three groups. These groups might represent different functions or might be the
result of different levels of skill. The Swifterbant area is located in an region providing only

[48] Distribution of Skeletal Lesions Within the East Smithfield Black Death Cemetery
The East Smithfield Black Death cemetery (c. 1349-50) contains individual and mass
graves. Previous researchers have suggested that the two grave types do not reflect social
status, but rather the mass graves were used when mortality was at its peak, and the
individual graves were used when mortality slowed. This project attempts to identify
systematic differences between individuals in mass versus individual graves with respect to
skeletal lesions and stature. By using such traits as a proxy for social status, this project
tests the idea that social status did not determine burial location in East Smithfield.

the archaeological evidence and its interpretations, but also the epistemological,

[140] Modeling Paleohydrology in Archaeological Contexts with Terrestrial LIDAR and GIS:
A Chaco Canyon Case Study
Advances in geospatial technologies make it possible to transform qualitative
environmental descriptions into GIS-based simulations that integrate models of prehistoric
terrain, hydrology, vegetation and geomorphology with archaeological contexts. This paper
outlines a research effort focused on the simulation and analysis of the flow and
accumulation of water across projected archaeological landscapes, using 10th to 13th
century Chaco Canyon as a case study. Special focus is placed on the collection and use
of terrestrial LIDAR data for the catchment that encompasses two major Chacoan Great
Houses, Pueblo Bonito and Chetro Ketl.

[278] 15,000-Year Record: Laminated Sediment Fill with Ice Wedge Inter-zones, Owl Cave,
Eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho
Partial collapse of a roof blister opened a lava tube to infill by eolian fine sandy silt. Rain
and snowmelt caused remobilization and created thin laminations that characterized most
of the final 5.5m-thick deposit. Episodic dry, cold intervals coeval with glacier fluctuations in
the nearby Lemhi Mountains interrupted sedimentation and promoted formation of ice
wedge episodes occurring between ca. 8,000 BP, when about 150 bison were slaughtered,
and shortly after the 6,600 BP Mazama ash fall. A gritty basal unit was deformed by
thixotropic flame structures, perhaps during a major earthquake.

This paper will investigate how Nahua patrons and painters in early-colonial-period
Tetzcoco, Mexico, used the cave as a metaphor for the pre-Hispanic divine in the Quinatzin
Map of c. 1542. Although the cave figures as a historical place associated with the
Chichimec ancestors who first settled in the eastern valley of Mexico, the manuscript also
qualifies it, by visual analogy and metaphor, as a place of divine creation, thus referencing
pre-Hispanic notions of divine kingship.

[34] Trade and exchange
Charles Di Peso’s pioneering research on northern Mexico created prehistory upon a
tabula rasa. Unsurprisingly, the unprecedented evidence for exchange between Casas
Grandes and distant regions looms large in his interpretations. Yet the “narrow and deep”
approach to the fieldwork provided little regional or temporal context for these exchanges.
Further, his hypothesis of a Toltec incursion specified that exchange was produced by a
unified Mesoamerican mercantile system, which simplified and distorted the causes of
exchange. This paper examines how reanalysis of the Casas Grandes data, greater
regional understandings, and new theoretical approaches provide more dynamic
understandings of multiple exchange networks.

The Mission period in southern California was a time of upheaval and culture change for
Native Americans. Eighteenth century Hispanic colonizers introduced new ideologies,
technologies, and social structures that dramatically altered the nature of Native Californian
society. Using archaeological and ethnohistoric data from southern California, we present
alternative models to track how the Gabrielinos of the Los Angeles Basin responded to this

Native American exposure to new traditions and how the incorporation of these Old World
constructs varied dramatically between and within Contact period Native Californian
communities.

mobility play in the use and eventual discard of those artifact classes for which
conventional measures of curation are not applicable. The results raise new questions
about Aboriginal technological organization and land use, while simultaneously highlighting
the complex relationship between past human behavior and archaeological assemblage

The first is a series of standing buildings located within Valles Caldera National Preserve in

[115] Natufian flint versus ground stone tools: A use-wear perspective on subsistence
change]
Use-wear and technological studies suggest that Natufian flint assemblages share several
characteristics with Mesolithic assemblages of Europe, as both regions show an extensive
production of microlithic tools mostly devoted to animal procurement and exploitation. In the
Levant, this association seems to be rooted in previous cultural traditions. In contrast to flint
tools, ground stone tools show the development of a new technology partly related to the
exploitation of plants. This paper discusses the implications and symbolic significance of
this flint versus ground stone tool dichotomy for our understanding of Natufian subsistence

Analyses of population structure in small-scale, highly-related populations suffer from the

produced some interesting, yet equivocal test explanations of the observed spatial variation
on the island. We compare these studies, as well as the picture generated from stylistic

The basic building block for African societies, as elsewhere in the world is the village.
However, the diversity of socio-political systems characterizing similar sized settlements
throughout the continent is vast. At their core are novel and poorly understood forms of
authority and power, which can be concentrated or dispersed through complex social
strategies. Understanding intra-village organization and its materiality is fundamental to
describing larger systems that build from or transcend these. This paper presents socio-

Beringian artifacts and subsistence patterns also begin to include some that mirror interior
North America, implying a contribution of population from that direction as well as a still

Preliminary GIS results show distinctive patterns of seasonality in the C13 data that

its importance in the Navajo social imaginary expressed in traditional Navajo creation

designed to occupy a specific conceptual position on the landscape through references to
mythic ancestors and the creation of mankind. Additional investigation of imagery and
architecture at neighboring capitals demonstrates how elites throughout the highlands
justified their rule by manipulating the interaction between people and the built
environment.

Desert Region during the Late Archaic (ca. 2000 BC-AD 700)
Recent archaeological investigations in the western Colorado Desert have uncovered
evidence suggesting that a shift in site settlement strategy occurred in the Southeastern
Desert Region within mid-to-late Gypsum and early Rose Spring Complexes. The shift from
short-term habitation indicative of highly mobile hunter-gatherers to intensively occupied
longer-term residential settlement is marked by the emergence of pit houses, living floors,
and roasting features in the western Colorado Desert. Internal and external factors leading
to this shift will be discussed in light of archaeological evidence implicating southeastern
desert cultural interaction with neighboring regions.

[20] Complex taphonomic processes at a historic Albuquerque cemetery
The cemetery associated with the Alameda Hacienda, just north of Albuquerque NM, was
in use from approximately 1800 until 1903. Recent excavations involved removal of full or
partial remains of approximately 130 individuals from a 9.3 E/W x 6.2 N/S x 1.5d meter
area. Several factors, including serial interment and disinterment, flooding, utility
installation, and road and house construction, resulted in a highly disturbed and complex
context. Additionally, it is not known what proportion of the cemetery was excavated. In this
presentation we describe approaches to reconstructing cemetery history, demography,
paleopathology, and estimating the minimum number of individuals.

A comprehensive database of georeferenced 14C dated archaeological phases has been
constructed for two geographically separated archaeological regions. The period spanning
the 8.2K event is divided into a series of time-steps. Non-redundant radiometric dates from
each time-step are summed and used as a proxy for population size. Spatial-temporal
orderings of key environmental, socio-technological and demographic events are
reassessed in terms of case-specific population dynamics.

[101] Hunter-Gatherer Diet Specialization in the Central Eastern California
Hunter-gatherers occupying the arid regions of eastern California in the rain shadow of the
Sierra Nevada mountains display two distinct periods of dietary specialization. The first
around 3000 years ago was focused on large game. The second around 600 years ago
was focused on small-seeded plants. Traditional explanations relying on simple models
implicating population pressure and/or climate change as catalysts have been questioned
in recent years. It is not that these factors are unimportant, more that more nuanced
explanations showing how these processes affect human behavior are needed.

[190] Pastoralism in the Western Eurasian Iron Age: Looking beyond the Kurgan Evidence
Current models of Iron Age pastoralist societies in Ukraine are largely based on perceived
connections between burials and historical records, which are used to reconstruct culture-
historical processes and events; often in the complete absence of archaeological data and
anthropological theory. Although scholars have begun to recognize the limited utility of this
approach, there are few critical studies of Iron Age pastoralism in the western steppes. In
an attempt to fill this lacuna this paper focuses on the evidence for a pastoralist component

and trimmings, providing showrooms and acting as full-service “funeral directors” instead.
The assemblage at City Cemetery is analyzed through a comparison with

During the Woodland period, the Témiscouata region located in northeastern North

by mobile hunter-fisher-gatherers notably attracted by the lithic raw material available:
Touladi chert. Two prehistoric quarries are known in this region, which are associated with
many archaeological sites showing all stages of manufacture and use. In this context, a
technological analysis in the French tradition using chaîne opératoire combined with use
wear studies is particularly interesting for reconstructing the techno-economic system of
Touladi chert exploitation both in a regional and chronological perspective.

[159] No man is an island
The question of skill and transmission of knowledge has never been addressed in stone
age archaeology in Norway. In Norway there is no indigenous flint, only relatively scarce
resources of ice transported flint nodules found along the coast. Still, we find high quality
workmanship in flint, so there must have existed an apprenticeship. With so little flint
available – what is the nature of the apprenticeship? Does the teaching methods become
innovative or limited? Will there, socially, be restrictions concerning who or how many that
can learn to knap? Geographically, can the apprenticeship only be carried out by the
coast? This paper will address these questions using a number of island sites from the late
mesolithic in eastern Norway as a case study.

[260] The Southwest Athapaskan Equation. Enclave Ideology in the Colonization of New
Mexico by the Jicarilla Apaches
Jicarilla Apache movement from the Plains into the northern Rio Grande after 1730 is
marked by changes in settlement, economy, and landscape connections. This process of
“enclavement” was facilitated by the occupation of open ecological niches created by the
Spanish land grant system and expansion of trade to include new ethnic groups on the
frontier of Colonial settlement. Micaceous clay source utilization and archaeological site
distributions map the personified universe of the Jicarilla and reveal the essential
underpinnings of the enclave ideology supporting colonization. Similar strategies may have

Stable isotope analyses of both Mesolithic and Neolithic (Early and Mid-Holocene) humans
demonstrate a rich diversity in resource utilization in Sweden and the East Baltic countries
both before and after the introduction of agriculture. In contrast to the situation on the
Atlantic coast, there is no sharp shift in diet at the onset of the Neolithic, but instead clear
evidence of hunter-fisher-gatherer groups existing in parallel with farming groups. Although
archaeological evidence of contact between groups have been interpreted in terms of
farmers seasonally hunting seal, intra-individual stable isotope analyses rule out that
explanation, since diet within each group is consistent throughout life.

patterns that likely coincide with Pleistocene lake levels in Jakes Valley. Lithic analysis
reveals differences in technological organization, toolstone selection and settlement
patterns between these traditions.

[203] The earliest inhabitants of the Holmul region and the origins of Maya Civilization in
the Preclassic period.
Preliminary results of 2007 survey and excavations at Preclassic sites in the Holmul region
combined with analysis of ceramic, settlement and paleo-ecological data are presented
here to address issues relating to the peopling of the southern Maya Lowlands and the
origins of centralized ritual and power institutions in the Preclassic period. A long period of
local development in farming activities is recorded in local lake sediments which predates
local ceramic and architectural traditions, among the earliest in the Maya Lowlands, as well
as large-scale construction of ritual centers and inter-regional interactions in the Middle
Preclassic period.

Tradition and Socio-Economic Necessity
The study of the bone and antler projectile points, representing half of the Early Mesolithic
manufactured items, shows differences in manufacture and tends in morphology.
Compared with the rest of the industry and taking into account the used anatomical parts,
these arms are merely significant enough to discuss an « industrial dynamism » in the Early
Holocene. Patterns involved in their evolution seam to be related more to a « speciation »
of the hunting gear that is probably linked to techno-economic necessities, than to an

[300] Seeking Middle Ground: Repatriation’s Roles in Negotiating New Relationships
Among Indigenous Communities, Museums and Archaeologists
Museum repatriations of Indigenous cultural property are central to transformations
unfolding at the interface of archaeology, descendent communities, and museums in North
America. To understand crucial dynamics driving these changes I investigated repatriations
outside NAGPRA’s purview and those demonstrating exceptional circumstances. My
comparison of repatriation processes and results at the Arizona State Museum and
Calgary’s Glenbow Museum illustrates significant institutional variation in repatriation
approaches and consultations. Both museums, however, share similar proximate goals
fostering productive dialogue. Repatriation is profoundly influencing institutional
organization and mission, extending beyond legal mandates and revealing commitments to
seek middle ground through good faith negotiations and extra-NAGPRA collaborations.

[141] Discovering Land Use Variability and Ceramic Subregions: A Regional Approach to
Site Survey in Central Thailand
The prevalent model of Metal Age agricultural economies as focused on wet-rice cultivation
has not been fully supported by recent research. An intensive survey in central Thailand
found 25 long-lived settlements dating between 2000 B.C. and A.D. 1000, most of which
did not have access to land suitable for wet rice cultivation. How these enduring societies
interacted with the local landscape is the subject of this paper. Metal age land use and
settlement systems in central Thailand were quite variable, even in the iron age. The paper
will argue that ceramic subregions provide clues for understanding these heterarchical
landscape systems.

[159] The Greenstone Dimension - Skill in Connection to Axe Production in Central
Bohuslän, Sweden
Greenstone axes and related debris have been found on a site in the province of Bohuslän,
western Sweden. The lithic production can further be distinguished with regard to skill.
Flakes testify how skill could be acquired by applying variables such as weight and platform
appearance. It is stated that certain production stages are related to individual learning-by-
doing while other stages require instructions as part of an institutionalised apprenticeship.
Since complete axes have been found next to waste we may define specific purposes
behind the production. Production might further be related to degrees of specialisation and
general demands in society.

analysis was conducted on faunal remains from fourteen Virginia plantation sites, divided

each status group between sites, which can be explained by the social and environmental
factors on each plantation.

[292] From intensive use to abandonment: exploring temporal tendencies in marine
resources exploitation in Northern Patagonia since Mid Holocene times
The use of marine resources by prehistoric North Patagonian hunter-gatherers was
traditionally considered as marginal and sporadic. However, archaeological projects that we
have started in San Matías Gulf (Río Negro, Argentina) uncovered plentiful evidence of
coastal resource exploitation. Isotopic values obtained from human remains in this area
suggest marine diets from about 3000 to 2000 yr BP. However, a lower representation of
marine food was evidenced at about 1200 yr BP, and in historical times the coast had been
abandoned. We are exploring the causes of these changes in subsistence patterns with
studies of technology, bioarchaeology and paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

Luminescence dating on ceramics has traditionally used thermoluminescence (TL). More

has advantages in terms of precision and amount of material required. For fine-grained
materials, using OSL in combination with infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) may also
provide a way to circumvent anomalous fading, a problem for many ceramics that produces
an age underestimation if not corrected. A fairly new development, pulsed OSL, may also
help in this regard. These developments are explored in the dating of ceramics from
eastern North America.

Holocene age (9,500 – 9,000 14CBP) sites associated with ancient shorelines. Organic
remains at some of these sites support a well-developed maritime adaptation. There are
significant differences among these assemblages, likely relating to site function.

Around 1000 AD, agriculturalists in southwestern-most Ontario, archaeological leavers of

Several lines of zooarchaeological evidence may be brought to bear on questions of

Arguments for an intensification and perhaps specialization of cattle herding in a formerly

[17] Late Holocene paleoclimatic records from the eastern Canadian Arctic: archaeological
implications
High-resolution lake sediment records from the eastern Canadian Arctic were synthesized
to provide regional reconstructions of paleoclimatic changes for the past two millennia.
Records from Baffin Island and Melville and Boothia Peninsulas provide evidence for long-
term cooling since 2000 years ago; lowest temperatures occur between 600 and 150 years
ago (Little Ice Age) following several centuries of relatively warmer temperatures. Local
impacts of these climatic changes on food web structure and biological production may
have influenced Thule settlement in this region. Combining paleoclimatic and
archaeological data help to quantify the relative importance of environmental factors in
human social change.

[159] Stonecraft, Sociability and Skill in Prehistoric Scotland
In Scotland an array of distinctive lithic raw materials were exploited by prehistoric
knappers including pebble flint, various types of quartz and quartzite, agate and volcanic
glass – pitchstone. Many are localised in occurrence and considered poor in quality.
Discussion within the archaeological literature has often failed to fully appreciate the
variability within particular materials and has focused on sourcing. This paper will review
the analytical challenges created by such a diverse range of stone use and re-evaluate
existing interpretations that have tended to ignore skill and social issues as a salient factors
in assemblage variation.

Using a large suite of stable isotope values from directly dated human remains recovered
from the sites of Pikimachay, Rosamachay, Trigopampa, Conchopata, and Huari it will be
argued that maize was the mainstay of the subsistence economy of Peru's Ayacucho
Valley from at least ca. 800 BC and that maize agriculture was the economic foundation of
the Wari polity, the first urban, state society of the Andean sierra. In addition isotopic
evidence for the use of fertilizer and intensive agriculture is considered and evaluated with
respect to sociopolitical changes in the region.

[214] The Effects of Reduction and Sampling in Source Provenance Analyses of
Paleoarchaic Lithic Artifacts
Stone tool provenance analyses in the Great Basin have traditionally focused on formal
tools despite recognition that these tools probably over-represent more distant, higher
quality sources. A recently published study of obsidian artifacts in the western Great Basin
demonstrates with three case studies that the provenance signals of formal tools and small
late-stage reduction flakes often differ from those of large flakes. The model was tested in
the more complex lithic terrain of the central Great Basin by comparing provenance signals
of formal tools and production debitage from several Paleoarchaic sites in the region.

[95] A Preliminary Analysis of Late Pleistocene (OIS 3 and 4) Lithic Technological Changes
at Moche Borago Rockshelter, Ethiopia using Computer-Assisted Morphometry
The African Late Pleistocene documents distinct changes in how stone tools were made
and used. Many of these changes are classified within the transition from Mode 3 to Mode
4 lithic technologies, though within-Mode change exists also. At Moche Borago rockshelter,
in south-central Ethiopia, a two-meter sequence spanning the Holocene and Late
Pleistocene provides one of the longest archaeological sequences within Northeast Africa.
Using a computer-assisted morphometrics analysis of the lithic debitage from Moche
Borago, this paper examines the timing and nature of technological changes evident from
the debitage and relates these changes to other aspects of the lithic assemblage.

[270] Networking and isolation in the North Pacific: The role of information in the Kuril and

A model is developed concerning forager investments in information networks under
ecological and demographic stability/vulnerability and relative isolation. Extensive networks
should be more important in volatile environments. By contrast, costs/risks of voyaging
would discourage networking where ecological and demographic vulnerability is low,
allowing for greater isolation. This model is used to explore the cultural continuities and
discontinuities of the Aleutian and Kuril islands-- ideal settings for comparative study of
small scale, insular foraging groups, social networking, and cultural transmission. This
paper predicts changing scales of style horizons, distribution of raw materials, and
geochemical signatures of mobility.

Regional landscapes can be understood as the intersection of multiple conceptual
topographies of social activity and interregional interaction. This perspective moves beyond
a focus political cores, which relegates surrounding areas to peripheral status the relevance
of which are defined entirely in terms of interactions with these core areas. We elaborate
this position with a case study of macro-regional interaction in Central China, modern
Sichuan, Chongqing, Hubei and Hunan. By examining the mosaic of overlapping social
topographies in this region, we highlight politically peripheral regions as critical in the
development of specialized production and the emergence of local identities.

Historically, the Swahili have performed feasts where they negotiated and contested social
power. Feasts draw on tradition and practice, but create the space for, and conditions of,
imbalance and social debt. I use this historical frame to examine feasting in the more
distant Swahili past, in particular looking at how feasts can domesticate distant power—the
power drawn from objects and practices from elsewhere. By charting changing
assemblages of imported and local ceramics, I examine changes in feasting patterns and
the way feasts provided a social context within which local and distant power could be
forged and translated into authority.

Adornment in Anglo-Saxon Graves
Brooches are common artifacts found in Anglo-Saxon graves. They are often decorated
with an intricate animal style that suggests its use as a ritualized, restricted text. Specific
motifs may have been confined to specific classes, kin groups, genders, and ages. Through
the contextual study of these ornaments, it may be possible to understand more fully the
social structures of early medieval societies and the ways in which brooches were used to
visually express social identity. Presented is an analysis of personal ornaments and stylistic

[316] Fiber Technology and Weaving at Formative Period Chalcatzingo
While considerable research has been conducted on the importance of textiles in later

consisting only of fabric-impressed clay and fragments of cloth and cordage. However,
depictions of textiles in Formative Period sculpture at sites like Chalcatzingo provide
additional material for analysis, and further evidence can be found in the re-examination of
artifacts recovered from this site. Analysis of these data together indicate that textiles held
considerable importance for these Formative Period cultures.

follow the traditional practice approach of investigating the actions of individuals through

group, treating sites in much the same way that occupation areas are viewed in practice
theory, to investigate daily practices at a larger scale. This approach is applied to a
landscape study of the Lake Ontario shoreline to investigate the approach’s archaeological
usefulness.

indicates temporal shifts in demographic composition and variation in preparation methods.
The temporal shifts previously observed in iconography and now identified in demographic
composition suggest changing ideology, while the preparation variation we noted may
indicate temporal, geographic or functional differences in trophy head use.

Detailed maps of ten archaeological sites along the Fraser and Harrison Rivers (70 to 150
km east of Vancouver) with well-preserved pithouse depressions show that the location,
size, and layout of villages varied a great deal over the past 2500. Comparisons of the
arrangements of housepits among the mapped villages show that there are two main
patterns, linear and irregular, and these may be related to the presence or absence of
above ground plank houses, the age of the occupation, and the site's location along the
Fraser River (and thus, social affiliation). These data help provide a new avenue for
exploring changing social identities of Coast Salish communities prior to the 1800s.

commodities. But the planting of settlers in New England and the mid-Atlantic remain
outside historiographical discussions of Europe’s East India enterprises. Acknowledging the
presence of refined Chinese commodities leads us to question historical narratives
portraying colonial settlements as economically under-developed outposts on the edges of

students, which can be used to develop student interest and understanding of ancient
civilizations. This lesson plan will use archaeology to provide a common connection to the
study of the Mediterranean and Mesoamerican worlds. It will illustrate archaeology through
“active learning” projects, which will illustrate key concepts from two active archaeological

[158] Evolution of an irrigation canal in the Yautepec Valley of Morelos, Mexico
This paper traces the changes in a trunk irrigation canal that has been in apparent
continuous use from its inception in the Terminal Formative through today. The system
began with summer season floodwater irrigation, and shifted to perennial irrigation in the
Epiclassic, after which the canals became travertine encrusted. The nature of water use
and manipulation changed through time as indicated by size of canals and the trajectory of
canal size is counterintuitive, with cross-sectional area decreasing as irrigated area
increases. Finally, radiocarbon dates on organic matter occluded in canal travertine were
found to be unreliable indicators of canal age.

[259] Application of Micromorphological and Chemical Techniques on Buried Prehistoric
Soils in Canada
Buried soils at archaeological sites are often thin and discontinuous, exhibiting few of the
visible characteristics typically used to identify the presence of past soil formation.
Micromorphological and chemical techniques are a key factor in the identification of soil
forming processes. A variety of these techniques have been applied to several buried soils
at archaeological sites in Canada, revealing some of the less visible factors involved in soil
formation. The recognition and identification of these processes are vital to everything from
the simple reconstruction of vegetation supported by these soils to the interpretation of how
past groups utilized landscapes.

[254] Analysis of lithic technological organization at a Woodland Stage site in central
Alabama
The focus of this paper is a continuation of prehistoric cultural research from a Woodland
Stage site in central Alabama. Excavations were conducted in 1976 and in 2006. Analysis
results of chipped stone tools from both seasons were combined to create a substantial
database utilizing a technological/morphological approach. Artifact distribution data of
chipped stone tools and debitage indicate areas of lithic industry at the site. A Woodland pit
house was identified during the 1976 season and cultural materials from the 2006 season
are strongly suggestive of the likelihood of additional pit houses.

[56] The Significance of the Revisionist Paradigm of Ancestral Maya Postclassic (from
Decadence to Cosmopolitanism)
Sabloff and Rathje proposed that Postclassic lowland Maya societies were not decadent
but rather pragmatically mercantilist. The elites of the Postclassic put their wealth-making
energies into commerce and a broadening access to material well being for their
constituents rather than into the imposing public monuments and palace arts of Classic
elites. In evolutionary terms, the Postclassic was in important respects an advance rather
than a decline compared to the Classic period. I evaluate this model in light of more than
thirty years of research and analysis since its presentation.

[213] Maya Migration Networks: methods for studying population movement in Belize
Strontium isotopes ratios (Sr87/Sr86) in human bones and teeth have been used
successfully to identify migration across Mesoamerica. This poster assesses the possibility
of measuring population movement within a small region, comparing individuals from Upper
Belize River Valley sites with those from the Mountain Pine Ridge site of Chalillo and
Caracol in the Vaca Plateau. Isotopic signatures for each region are distinct, and each
population should also have measurably different Sr signatures, making movement from
one polity to the other visible in the archaeological record. Results are discussed in the
context of existing studies and future research.

[145] Cowboys and Cattle Where the Deer Once Roamed: The Impact of Ranching on
Heritage Resources in Southern Interior British Columbia, Canada
This paper will evaluate the impact of 140 years of cattle ranching on heritage resources in
the Nicola Valley, southern British Columbia. Human agents, cattle activity, as well as
natural erosion have all impacted pre- and post-contact cultural resources to varying
degrees. Human agents include deforestation, the establishment of water control systems,
construction of transportation routes and cowboy camps, as well as development of ranch
tourist facilities. Cattle have also heavily impacted archaeological resources close to water
bodies and wetlands, as well as destroyed aboriginal trails. Subsequent on-going natural
erosion is an additional factor contributing to further degradation or disappearance of
heritage sites.

[158] Prehispanic Water Pressure at Palenque
Ancient water pressure systems have been documented extensively in the Old World. Pipe
segments with graded diameter reductions were used to generate water pressure as early
as 1400 BC. Until a recent discovery in Palenque of a sectional square pipe with similar
graded reductions, the New World was thought absent of closed channel pressurized flow.
Using hydraulic theory for open and closed conduits, scenarios of hydrologic and hydraulic
conditions for operation are developed including the impacts of the wet and dry season
runoff. This paper presents the hydroarchaeology of the New World’s earliest known
example of a water pressure system.

Previous researchers have concluded that finished ornaments and turquoise are
differentially associated with Chacoan great houses, particularly with the large structures
located in the bottom of the canyon. The recovery of jewelry items during the re-excavation
of three trenches in the Pueblo Bonito trash mounds allows for an examination of ornament
production and consumption associated with the structure from the perspective of a

related materials and compares them to those recovered from both Pueblo Bonito itself and
other sites in the canyon, including probable workshop areas.

[260] Rapid technological change following the White River eruption and the Athapaskan
migration from Yukon Territory
Radiocarbon dating of organic artifacts recovered from perennial ice patches in southern
Yukon allows direct dating of technological change associated with the White River
eruption. Bayesian modeling of the radiocarbon ages indicates that atlatl and throwing dart
technology ended ~A.D. 800, coincident with the eruption. Based on modeling of
radiocarbon ages, the eruption is about 150 years older than the earliest record of the bow
and arrow in the ice patches. These data suggest that the White River eruption was a local
disaster for northern Athapaskans and may have set in motion a migration, consistent with
the eruption-migration hypothesis.

[311] A Preliminary Model for Evaluating Site Use and Modern Impacts in the Northern
Great Basin
Three years of survey combined with 13 years of baseline data have provided information
vital to the reassessment of archaeological sites within the Northern Great Basin. By
combining this information with a preliminary resource reconstruction model we can begin
to form questions of how the use of resources in an arid environment are conditioned by
the social organization, group size, and mobility of past populations, and how
archaeological sites are affected by not only past changes in the environment over time,
but by modern agents as well. A unique predictive model based on this information could
assist archaeologists in evaluating sites based upon not only past conditions, but modern
impacts as well.

[270] Historic Yup’ik Landscape and Memory-Based Information Storage Process
Among the Yup’ik of western Alaska, multiple classes of information are stored and
accessed though the interaction of oral history and site location. Subsistence data are
important for any location, but subsistence is one component among data which include
social, political and historical processes. An archaeological site location study informed by
oral history revealed these patterns of information storage; providing insight into Yup’ik
notions of what significantly influences physical and cultural survival. If the Yup’ik context is
typical of hunter-gatherer processes, more types of information are stored more thoroughly
than expected from the materialist perspective present in hunter-gatherer archaeological

occupation phase of Santa Lucía. Two elder phases, also in relation with pottery
production, were detected by excavations. Nevertheless, the production in the last phase
seems to have reached industrial levels, which is due to socio-political changes in the

because of their strategically advantageous location on the coast. As market exchange,
redistribution, and ritual congregations involved greater numbers of people from a wider

unstable resources that varied in availability according to their altitude/latitude and climate.
Aterian populations developed skills to adapt to dry environments in the Upper Pleistocene
and Early Holocene foragers successfully coped with low predictability and latent
depauperation of food resources by developing a delayed-return strategy which eventually
led to animal domestication and food production. In addition to economic resources,
specialization involved settlement systems, mobility strategies, and risk and stress

Copper Age social formations of SW Spain, with a special focus on recent proposals that
describe them as "states". To this end, the case of the communities settled along the lower
Guadalquivir river valley (with a special focus on the Valencina de la Concepcion
settlement) is examined. The parameters of social complexity under consideration include
population aggregation, productive intensification, craft specialization, political
hierarchisation, power centralization and social inequality.

[155] (Re)constructing Teotihuacan Identity at Los Horcones, Chiapas
Within the discussions of Teotihuacan’s presence abroad one of the most fundamental
issues is the question of identity. How was Teotihuacan-style material culture used to
construct Central Mexican identity and by whom? At the site of Los Horcones on the Pacific
Coast of Chiapas, where trade from numerous regions was passing through, as well as
being consumed locally, a cosmopolitan signature further blurs the boundaries. This
international assemblage of material culture poses important challenges in identifying
Teotihuacan identity, and also to understanding the dynamics of local identity formation
amidst influences from diverse regions.

[57] Middle Holocene Hunter-Gatherer Adaptations: Patagonia and the Great Basin
For most of archaeology's history, the hunter-gatherer material record has been viewed as
discrete sites separated by voids, the sites representing ethnographic vignettes. Yet hunter-
gatherers used their landscapes at least as much in continuous as discrete terms,
generating complex and continuous material records. The record does not preserve
ethnographic vignettes but time-averaged patterns of organization. We discuss the
distribution of the archaeological record of different cases from Patagonia and the Great
Basin, illustrating the different scenarios of human adaptation variability to semi-desert
environments.

Salvage archaeological excavations were conducted in 2005 at four prehistoric shell
midden sites on the northeastern coast of the Gulf of California in Sonora, Mexico. The
sites are on the eastern and northern sides of Adair Bay, in the path of a planned new
coastal highway between Puerto Peñasco and Golfo de Santa Clara. Represented in the
subsistence remains were 36 species of molluscs, and also crab, fish, and terrestrial fauna.
Recovered artifacts included shell tools and ornaments, Late Archaic and Hohokam style
projectile points, ground stone tools, and more than a thousand pottery sherds, including
Hohokam and Trincheras styles.

modification of the site. Though these were chronologically and functionally distinct events,
their evaluation and comparison contributes to the understanding of patterns of camelid

This paper considers material life in two entrepots: Newport, established in 1639, and
Bristol, settled by Massachusetts Bay speculators in 1680 after the end of King Philip’s
War. Drawing on probate records, architectural evidence, and archaeological survey, the
paper draws explicit comparisons between the material worlds of mercantile capitalists
operating under markedly different religious, economic and social imperatives. Particular
emphasis is paid to the specific ways in which Newporters embraced more flamboyant and
obvious forms of consumption than their more conservative counterparts farther up
Narragansett Bay, and the implications of these distinctions for interpreting mercantilism in
the New England colonies.

This paper discusses the way food production defines and reinforces social relationships
within the context of developing social complexity. At the Formative site of Khonkho
Wankane, in the Bolivian Altiplano, activity areas are strictly defined by architecture.
Analysis of groundstone helps define both the mundane and ceremonial activity areas of
food production. Analysis of groundstone supports the idea that Khonkho Wankane was a
pilgramage center with a relatively low permanent occupation and that food production was
focused on locally available resources. These emerging patterns of food production and
social organization at Khonkho Wankane persisted into the growing Tiwanaku state.

assessing the impact pedagogical training has on the careers of graduate students and the

[75] Hunting strategies in late Pleistocene southwest Tasmania: the economic anatomy of
the Bennett’s wallaby
Australian Aborigines in southwest Tasmania adapted to the harsh late Pleistocene
environment by focusing on a particular prey species; the Bennett’s wallaby (Macropus
rufogriseus). Previous studies suggest that the over-representation of specific macropod
body parts and skeletal elements (in particular the split hindlimbs) implies humans were
targeting these bones for their relatively large marrow yield as part of their high latitude
survival strategy. However this assumption has yet to be tested. Investigation of the
economic anatomy and bone marrow analysis of the Bennett’s wallaby will help to better
understand human adaptation and hunting behaviour in late Pleistocene Tasmania.

[155] Material Culture and Ethnic Identity in Colonial and Postcolonial Soconusco
The Pacific coast of Chiapas and Guatemala is a natural immigration route linking Mexico
with Central and South America, and the region has been at least a temporary home for a
number of ethnolinguistic groups. In the Soconusco region, the Colonial and Postcolonial
years have been particularly dynamic periods for immigration, and historical documents
frequently note the ethnolinguistic identity of the region’s residents. Unlike the neighboring
highland zones that have retained a strong indigenous identity, people in the Soconusco no
longer identify themselves as indigenous. In this paper I explore the material evidence,
archaeological and documentary, for this identity shift.

[281] Investigating the Causes of Variability in House-Site Artifact Density on Historic Sites

Domestic sites occupied during the 18th and early19th century in Virginia display differing
patterns of artifact density. This variability has many potential sources. For instance, is it
caused by differences in depositional behavior or is it caused by post depositional
processes such as plowing or to both? Building on previous ethnographic and theoretical
research I will explore this question by analyzing evidence from archaeological sites
catalogued in the DAACS database. Plowed and unplowed house-sites will be compared,
as will ones with and without sub-surface features. Quantitative analysis will focus on
artifact size distributions and their variability by type and form.

detailed examinations of local ceramic traditions are needed. To contribute to this goal I
present the results of stylistic and technological analyses of Late Neolithic pottery from
several sites in Wadi Ziqlab, Jordan, and comment on the use of cultural categories in Late

This study addresses changes in mobility, diet, and social organization that occurred during
the Neolithic and Copper Age in the Great Hungarian Plain using strontium isotopes. The
87Sr/86Sr isotope ratio has been used previously to identify migration, conquest, and inter-
marriage. No major events of population movement are identified however isotope values
change from a narrow range in the Neolithic to a much broader range in the Copper Age,
suggesting that changes in lifestyle affected incorporation of strontium into the skeleton.
The results of this paper indicate that strontium is a valuable tool for identifying more subtle
changes in prehistoric behavior.

[81] The archaeology of social interaction: the formation of ‘place’ in a lived landscape
Although intensive regional survey offers robust data on human activity, settlement and
land use, there has been too little attempt to broaden understandings of landscape beyond
recording and interpreting material culture as products of interaction. This paper outlines a
social approach to the landscape concept by examining communication and human
interaction – roads, paths, their markers and monuments. Drawing on survey data from the
historic Middle East I illustrate how the materiality of human interaction cannot be
separated from the social fabric in which it was woven – the complex relationship between
physical movement, ‘places’ and meanings of social landscape.

[62] Migration Models and the Athapaskan Diaspora as viewed from the Colorado High
Country
Like all migrations, the movement of Athapaskans from their northern homeland into the
area they occupied at the time of contact was the end result of a combination of social and
environmental factors. Human migrations are rarely the product of unilinear movement of
population; they are instead the product of a complex sequence of stages usually involving
back and forth movement of both people and information. Proto-Apache sites in Colorado
provide evidence for both chain and reverse migration strategies used by Athapaskans to
move through and ultimately occupy high-elevation landscapes, presumably aided by high-
latitude adaptations retained from their northern homeland.

state society characterized by apparently urban settlements. Current analyses addressing
this relationship assume that harder to reach and more exclusive spaces hold a direct
relationship to higher levels of power and status. Nevertheless, Tairona towns and
buildings do not have high walls or gateways that subdivide, demarcate and parse out
spaces, which are then used by different segments of society. Given the urban fabric’s
extreme permeability, how then can power and control be expressed where an exclusive
architecture does not seem possible or even socially conceivable?

[141] The Potential of Exploratory Regional Survey to Uncover Evidence of Human-
Landscape Interaction: An Example from Northern Laos
Is it possible to apply a landscape approach when archaeologists open a new area to
research? The Middle Mekong Archaeological Project has implemented a regional research
design to assess human/landscape interaction in the Luang Prabang area over the past
10,000 years. This archaeologically unexplored region is situated in an area considered a
potential crossroads for people and technologies at several key points in Southeast Asian
prehistory. Surface collections from 58 sites found, in combination with data important for a
landscape perspective, provide evidence to evaluate this proposition.

[174] Methods of Phylogenetic Inference Using Archaeological Data
Recently, archaeology has seen a growing interest in the uses of phylogenetic methods,
specifically cladistic methods, for analysis of cultural data. However, in the biological
phylogenetic community a significant amount of research is published using maximum
likelihood and Bayesian phylogenetic approaches. This poster compares the assumptions
and results of each approach and their potential for archaeological inquiry. This research
uses data from sites throughout the Great Plains to test inferences about house variation.
Archaeological data presents unique challenges for model-based approaches to
phylogentetics but utilization of multiple approaches significantly enhances the potential for
archaeological research.

[209] Integrating Technologies: Defining Patterns of Historic Ute Occupation in the Early
20th Century, Uintah Basin, Utah
Throughout the Uintah Basin, Utah, historic Native American Ute participated in economic
practices akin to Euro-American counterparts while maintaining aspects of traditional lithic
technologies. This paper will examine artifacts from several potential historic Ute sites in
the heart of the research area to build patterns of modified tool use and to compare cultural
variation amongst deposited materials. Characteristics to be presented include
archaeological assemblage differences, glass shard utilization (e.g., scraper implements),
and site chronology based on temporally diagnostic items.

[309] Landscape Monuments and Political Competition in Late Bronze Age Anatolia: An
Investigation of Costly Signaling Theory
Display via landscape monuments provides elites a means to maintain and augment their
socio-political status, thus acting as one of the processes by which increasing political
hierarchy occurred. Neiman (1997) proposed that Maya stelae functioned as costly signals
of political power, explaining how such display translated into increasing status. In Late
Bronze Age Anatolia, monumental display, including figurative reliefs, inscriptions, dams
and reservoirs, is one of the most visible arenas in which Hittite great kings projected
territorial hegemony and negotiated its extent with both allies and competitors. We propose
to assess such display using a costly signalling framework.

[193] Waves in the Desert: Applying the Wave-of-Advance model to the spread of
agriculture in the American Southwest
The origin of agriculture in the American Southwest has been a source of extensive debate,
as competing theories of indigenous invention and demic diffusion are used to explain its
initial appearance. For the European Neolithic, the existence of the latter has been
supported by the application of the Wave-of-Advance model, suggesting that this spread is
caused by higher rates of reproductive success for initial migrants. Using GIS modeling,
this paper discusses both the fit of this demographic model to the Southwestern
archaeological record, as well as its suitability for understanding the spread of agricultural
economies in the New World.

[228] Religion and the Mesa Verde Migrations
Marked changes in pueblo organization and public architecture in the Northern San Juan
region during the early 1200s suggest some level of social, political, and religious
reorganization. The transition from great kivas to plazas and elaborations on presumably
Chacoan architecture (multi-walled structures) simultaneously express underlying
continuities with deeply rooted customs and significant innovations in traditional practices.
Tensions between maintaining continuity and accommodating innovation may have been
an important contributor to social tensions prompting migration. If so, this interplay likely
structured migrant group composition, the timing of emigration, and contributed to the
religious developments defining the Pueblo IV period.

[235] Bread Ovens of Newfoundland's Petit Nord
From the sixteenth century to the early twentieth, French fishermen came to the Petit Nord,
a region of Newfoundland’s Northern Peninsula, to harvest and process cod. International
treaties prevented French crews from over-wintering in Newfoundland. Since crews could
usually not secure a repeated access to a same site, fishing rooms typically comprised
ephemeral structures requiring a minimal investment of resources and time, with the
interesting exception of large bread ovens. The French bread ovens of the Petit Nord are
witnesses of the socio-economic importance of bread in the fishing crews’ lifeways, sense
of cultural identity and appropriation of space.

[300] A Human Right to Cultural Heritage: a Right to Dig or a Right to Protect?
This paper considers the possible role that United Nations Universal Declarations on
Human Rights (1948) and Cultural Diversity (2001) will play in site preservation and illicit
antiquities debates. The archaeological tendency is to protect cultural heritage from
unauthorized digging, but when local and Descendant digging becomes a process of
identity and socio-cultural adhesion then it can also be seen as a right to participate in
culture while contributing to ideals of cultural diversity. Thus, will professional and
governmental stewardship withstand a human rights argument or will it be vilified as an
homogenizing authority?

[275] What is the Nenana Complex?
In 1993, John Hoffecker, Roger Powers, and I proposed that the Nenana Complex was
“pre-microblade” and potentially ancestral to Clovis. We based our interpretations on the
normative view that technological/typological differences potentially reflected cultural
differences. Fifteen years later, we know that our model of the peopling of Beringia was
over-simplified and possibly incorrect. Nenana was not “pre-microblade,” and “non-
microblade” Nenana-like industries persisted well into the Holocene. So, what is the
Nenana complex? Here I revisit the problem through a new analysis of the Walker Road
lithic assemblage, attempting to explain Nenana through the perspective of raw-material
procurement and technological organization.

Several decades after the discovery of the famed Nahal Mishmar Hoard in the Judean
Desert many important questions about complex metals in the southern Levant during
Chalcolithic remain unanswered. The Levantine assemblage, comprising elegant castings
made from “alloyed” copper has grown, yet direct evidence for their production is extremely

made, and we can begin to answer questions about where the material came from, whether
the goods were locally cast, who commission them, and what brought then to their final

As Schreiber predicted (1992), Wari imperial occupation and control appear variably across

[52] Late and Contact Period Sto:lo (Coast Salish) Communities in the Upper Fraser Valley
Sto:lo communities in the upper Fraser Valley of southwestern British Columbia underwent
profound organizational changes in the late pre-colonial and early colonial eras. A
synthesis of data derived from recent village- and household-level investigations affords
new insights into household labor organization, rules of residential affiliation, settlement
population, and engagement in the broader economy before and after British settlement on
the interior margin of the Central Northwest Coast. We present data from three Late and
Contact period pithouse and/or plank-house villages along the salmon-rich Fraser River,
each associated with known Sto:lo placenames and the focus of an ongoing investigation.

[245] Upper Paleolithic Technological Provisioning Strategies and Land-Use in South-
Central Siberia
Siberia’s Pleistocene environments likely played a central role in decisions human foragers
made while procuring resources. As with subsistence organization, Siberian Upper
Paleolithic technological organization changed to accommodate these choices. Human
response to dramatic changes in climate and subsequent reorganization of food resources
before, during, and after the LGM should be reflected in the Siberian lithic record. This
paper will examine technological changes, specifically related to provisioning strategies and
land-use, at several MUP and LUP sites found in the Enisei River basin of south-central
Siberia to characterize human response to resource shifts from about 30,000-12,000 B.P.

[134] Socially Sanctioned Killing in America, Then and Now
Almost all societies sanction the killing of human beings in special circumstances. The
forms such sanctioning takes are strikingly similar cross-culturally: euthanasia, abortion,
war, or the death penalty. Some societies sanction more than one of these options, but the
most widely acceptable form of socially sanctioned killing, in our own time and in times
past, is war. I shall examine how individuals in societies such as ours come to accept and
to justify the killing of human beings, sometimes on a daily basis, as war, and the insight
this rationalizing behaviour provides into socially sanctioned in ancient Mesoamerica.

[63] Symmetry was for Rebels: A Descriptive Comparison of Southeastern United States
and Bahamian Loyalist Plantation Design
The Revolutionary War forced British Loyalists and their slaves to relocate from the United
States to the Bahamas. They constructed plantations throughout the archipelago, changing
the geographic and cultural landscape of the British colony. These plantations did not
directly reflect models from the Southeastern United States and were unique cultural
expressions of late 18th and early 19th century plantation design. This suggests that the
island environment and the cultural sensibilities of the Loyalists required the adaptation of
mainland models. After descriptive analysis of fifteen U.S. and ten Bahamian plantations,
this paper explores environmental and cultural explanations for variation among them.

[33] Agricultural Production and Lithic Distribution in Pololu Valley, North Kohala, Hawaii

Combining archived archaeological data with analyses of charcoal and lithic materials from
Pololu Valley, Hawai‘i Island, we have new evidence regarding the chronology of
agricultural development and changing sources for basalt artifacts. One of a few windward
valleys on Hawai‘i to be studied, Polulu was occupied as early as the 12th century AD.
Agricultural production utilized both dry and wet terrace complexes, some stratigraphically
linked, and now with AMS radiocarbon dates. Lithic materials were recovered throughout
the valley and geochemical analyses document a shift from local, possibly dispersed
sources, to local quarry materials, and finally to non-local resources.

[304] Trash Deposition, Feature Fill, and the Nature of Settlement and Community at
Queen Creek
Excavations at seven sites have yielded a wealth of data concerning trash deposition and
the character of feature fill in contexts dating from the Early Agricultural Period through the
Preclassic Period. These data allow us to examine issues concerning the nature of
settlement and community throughout this long period. In this paper, I examine artifact and
volumetric data from features and fill to examine occupation duration and intensity and
variation in site activities through time. Using these data, we can begin to reconstruct
changes in settlement and community which may have taken place with the shift to a
domestication economy.

[295] Methodological considerations of excavating longhouses on the Northwest Coast
Excavating Northwest Coast longhouses is complicated because vast quantities of organic
remains and artifacts preserve well in shell middens. The resulting "data overload"
necessitates a carefully designed sampling strategy. Extensive excavations from the Ozette
archaeological site have produced enormous quantities of data from entire house floors. A
sampling simulation of this data, in which subsamples are selected in order to evaluate
various sampling designs, may help provide guidelines for future excavations of
longhouses. This research has implications for methods and interpretations of hierarchy
and social organization within the context of Northwest Coast household archaeology.

This paper discusses recent archaeological research at the pithouse village of EeRb 77 on

component site is significant as it is the only well-preserved housepit village still existing in
the Kamloops area and previous research adjacent to the village site provided evidence of
long-term and relatively continuous flood plain occupation extending to 7,000 years ago.
This season's excavations concentrated on three cultural depressions within the village
settlement and revealed new information about the Late Period occupation at the site.

[57] The Great Basin of Western North America
From a human perspective, the Great Basin (the area of internal drainage in the arid
western United States) was an unfriendly place during the Middle Holocene. Virtually all
paleoclimatic indicators—lake levels, lake chemistries, treelines, plant community
composition, and small mammal histories—show that this was generally a time of elevated
temperatures and unfavorable precipitation/evaporation ratios. The frequency structure of
radiocarbon dated archaeological sites through time suggests that human population
densities in many parts of the Great Basin dropped substantially in response to this climatic
regime, although other details of this response remain unclear.

[312] Kilometer 4 Archaeological Sequence
Kilometer 4 is one of the best documented and longest occupied Preceramic Period
archaeological sites on the Andean coast. Forty-two 14C dates from shell and charcoal
remains from domestic features, burials and shell middens document a 9000 year
occupation, between 10,000 to 1000 BC. The dates, along with archaeological analyses,
indicate changes through time in subsistence, settlement and mortuary patterns. Questions
remain, however. Some variations may be due to contemporaneous variation rather than
temporal differences. Also, during the Late Archaic Period in particular, re-use of wood (the
“old wood problem”?) may obscure fine-grained temporal differences.

[309] More Than Skin Deep: A Practice-Oriented Approach to Building Ceramic Typologies

Ceramic ware typologies traditionally rely on vessel form and decoration, which have been
essential tools of discrimination since the earliest antiquarian and archaeological research.
However, recent developments in material studies and practice theory suggest that vessel
structural attributes such as clay preparation, firing temperature, and formation technique
should play an equal role in determining the parameters that distinguish one vessel type
from another. In this study of ceramic materials from Late Bronze Age Armenia, traditional
ceramic data has been coupled with digital radiographic imagery to achieve a more
practice-centered local pottery typology.

Ritual cave use on the Northwestern Plains is evidenced by distinctive rock art and

and cave modification. Ritual use consists of shamanism activity, vision quests, and
personal or group ceremony and is distinct from daily subsistence use or biographic
recording. Activity in the western mountains utilized all kinds of sites, from open bluffs to
enclosed caves, while central and eastern areas more commonly utilized enclosed cave
rooms, dark zone settings, and deeper cave-like rockshelters.

different cultures using this geographical area for different functions. Scenes with weapons
provide information on status within a culture as well as intercultural relations and can be

Increasing archaeological evidence suggests that the prehistoric Gulf of Georgia underwent
relatively rapid changes in economic, social and political organization in the few centuries

shifts in resource exploitation, increasing intensity of social engagement across the region,
and, at the household level, a significant re-organization of labour. This paper explores the
interplay of population shifts, settlement expansion, village formation and household
changes in the context of developments on the sociopolitical landscape in the southern Gulf

while the lack of local large prey forced an increase in the distance traveled for
procurement. 87Sr/86Sr ratios derived from cottontails show highly constrained 87Sr/86Sr
ratios throughout the sequence, suggesting local habitat procurement. Deer show a pattern
consistent with intensified non-local procurement strategies, visible via an increase in

Until the 1950’s-1960’s, when irrigation projects drained the wetlands of the Ghab Basin in

and zooarchaeological data suggest the presence of wetland fauna as early as the third
millennium BC. This paper presents the results of zooarchaeological work at Tell Qarqur in

supplemented the normal “suite” of Near Eastern food animals (cows, pigs, sheep, and
goats), especially in the medieval period.

[285] Differential Social Interaction: The Regional Diversity of Boldface Bowl Design in the
Mimbres Region A.D.750-900
Artistic expression, like language, has an infinite number of combinations, but as with
spoken language artistic expression only uses a finite number of design combinations to
produce a meaningful expression. The designs that are used come from a lexicon that is
deemed acceptable by the artist’s culture and by individual invention. In this paper I will
present data that identify isochrestic designs and emblemic designs on Mimbres Boldface
Bowls (A.D. 750-900). By isolating these designs I will show that the people within the
Mimbres River Valley maintained a different relationship with people outside of the valley
than with each other.

[278] Bison Jump? A Fresh Approach to Future Investigations at the Wasden Site
Although previous researchers have argued that Owl Cave was utilized as a bison jump
roughly 9000 years ago, this supposition has yet to be demonstrated. Because portions of
the bone bed remain intact, future investigations will focus on determining the function of
these natural trap features and enhance our understanding of the bone layer. A high-
resolution GIS digital elevation model will also be generated. Information regarding slope,
hydrology, and landscape visibility can then be used to predict potential drive lanes. These
applications, in addition to zooarchaeological analyses, will be used to interpret the validity
of the bison jump hypothesis.

[136] Lessons from the Preclassic Pacific Slope
This paper explores several themes that recur in the art and iconography of the Preclassic
period, particularly along the Pacific slope of Guatemala, and considers them in light of the
major contributions made by Stone to the study of Classic Maya art. Using methods utilized
by Stone, this paper considers both the continuities between specific motifs from the
Preclassic and Classic periods while also taking into consideration unique contextual
circumstances that point to subtle shifts in meaning at the hands of elites at individual sites.

[102] Accessing Ritual: An Analysis of Architectural Features in Ancient Maya Caves
Although a substantial amount of archaeological research has been carried out on Maya
religious ritual uses in caves, these studies have placed a considerable focus on
interpretations based on ethnohistoric, ethnographic, and modern activities documented at
cave sites. A recent literature review of cave investigations conducted in Guatemala,
Belize, and Mexico, however, has revealed that subterranean architectural features,, were
consistently constructed and used among the Maya during pre-Hispanic times. The variable
location and distribution of architectural modification within caves demonstrate that they
were important in emphasizing the sanctity of a space that was already considered sacred.

penetrating radar (GPR). Two grid regions were covered with the geophysical
instrumentation; Grid 1 was set up as a 50m by 80m survey and Grid 2 as a 50m by 17m

could provide subsurface images of the Classic Period ancient Mayan living surface.
Forward modeling and processing and analysis of real data have identified features that
appear to be agricultural ridges, corresponding with discoveries of test pit excavations.

Valley Belize: Implications for pre-Hispanic Maya Cave Ritual.
During the last two decades the WBRCP has applied a regional approach to the study of
ritual cave use by the ancient Maya of the Roaring Creek Valley, Belize. Data collected by
our investigations have noted that the patterns of deposition of human remains differ
significantly between rockshelters and caves, and of preferences for particular landscapes
within the latter. This paper describes the contexts in which these human remains have
been discovered and discusses their implications for pre-Hispanic Maya cave rituals.

[161] New Perspectives on Neolithic Inequality: Mortuary and Isotopic Research at Tell
Halula, Syria
Despite considerable previous research, archaeologists have only a limited understanding
of the process and trajectory of emerging social inequality in early Neolithic villages. In this
presentation we present the results of new isotopic research on well-dated human burials
recovered from Tell Halula, and compare these to detailed mortuary analysis of, basically,
associated grave goods. Analysis of these materials highlights distinct practices that
appear to be community specific, and other practices that are part of a broader regional
system of burial. These results force us to reconsider traditional views of emerging social
inequality within early Neolithic villages.

[96] Early Metal in South India: Copper and Iron in Megalithic Contexts
In South India early metal artifacts, usually associated with megalithic sites, include both
copper and iron. Although in some cases copper artifacts predate those of iron, there is no
evidence of an extensive metallurgical tradition based on copper and its alloys. Typological
studies have had limited success in explaining the megalithic sites and the production and
consumption of metal, while other approaches have not explicitly addressed the social
contexts of metal production. Understanding the role of metal production and consumption
in megalithic contexts means reevaluating traditional paradigms about the nature of these
sites and about how metal technologies develop.

This poster discusses censers excavated at the site of Calixtlahuaca, an important city in
central Mexico during the Postclassic period. Censer sherds are abundant in domestic
contexts, but they are absent in burials. I describe an analysis of attributes of form and size,
which leads to inferences on the use and significance of censers at the site. Most censers
are decorated with small spikes, and I compare these to spiked censers from other
contexts in Mesoamerica. Calixtlahuaca is the only central Mexican site in which spiked
censers were the dominant kind of domestic ritual object.

[117] Comparative Study Of Bone Mineralization In Guanaco (Lama Guanicoe).
Implications For Differential Preservation In Archaeological Sites
Zooarchaeologists frequently analyze skeletal parts representation and mortality profiles to
evaluate human economic decisions. Different taphonomic processes are mediated by
bone mineral density causing the under representation of certain skeletal parts and
younger age groups. The aim of this paper is to present a bone mineralization curve for
guanaco (Lama guanicoe) considering the ontogenic development of the species.
Densitometric analyses of guanaco bones from six age classes have been conducted. The
purpose of this analysis is to evaluate the mineralization process along the life span of the
guanaco and to explore if there is a bias against younger individuals due to differences in
bone mineral content.

the management of water canals in irrigating large fields, but also a system designed to
capture, transport, and accumulate rich soils along the arid margins of the upper basin of

variables that need to be addressed to fully understand the social and economic
management of irrigation plots in a complex archaeological irrigation system.

[22] The View from Opposite Shores: Complex Hunter-Gatherers of the Japanese
Archipelago and California
Comparative studies between the Jomon cultures of prehistoric Japan and Native American
cultures of late prehistoric and historic California provide unique opportunities to investigate
mechanisms of long-term hunter-gatherer cultural change in relation to climate change and
population density. Previous studies indicate that both groups utilized nuts, seeds, and/or
fish, including salmon, and that their importance varied through time. Despite these
similarities, the long-term trajectories of these two cultural zones are markedly different.
Using both archaeological and ethnographic data, this paper demonstrates how such a
comparison can help us understand changes in subsistence, settlement, and society of
complex hunter-gatherers.

bed excavated in the 1960s) received preliminary examination and remains largely
unreported. Site-specific questions concerning faunal composition, the number of events
represented, seasonality, processing or other taphonomic agents can be addressed by
applying zooarchaeological analyses to the existing collection. These efforts will generate a
more robust picture of the Owl Cave assemblage and guide future research at the site.

[28] The Sagas and Icelandic Archaeology
In the early years of Icelandic archaeology, in the late 19th century, scholars traveled
around Iceland with the sagas in one hand and a shovel in the other. They were convinced
that the sagas were true, and were in search of evidence to support them. Today we
recognize such literal interpretation was highly subjective. So how has the use of literature
shaped the current state of Icelandic archeology? Some Icelandic archaeologists have
argued there is no archaeological value in the sagas. The MAP excavations at Hrísbrú and
Egil’s Saga have demonstrated the use of saga literature has significant archaeological
merit.

[314] Mimesis, Alterity, and the Subaltern: Maya Figurines through the Generations
Iconographic analyses of Maya figurines often suggest that the images reflected social
reality. While this may be the case to some extent, a mimetic interpretation following
Michael Taussig and others highlight the subtitles in which humans are not merely passive
receptors of an external world, but creatively channel and engage with social categories
and situations to meet new needs and challenges. In particular, attention to mimesis carves
space for the subaltern and the negotiated relationships between dominant and
subordinated groups. This paper takes up these themes in relation to Maya figurines from
the Classic to Colonial periods.

[246] Surviving Catastrophe in Early Modern Iceland – Environmental Archaeology meets
Historical Archaeology in the Subarctic
The early modern period (1600-1800) in Iceland was a time of dangerously variable
climate, epidemics, a highly restrictive trade monopoly, and destructive volcanic eruptions.
Zooarchaeological analysis of middens from a range of settlements have, especially in
combination with other facets of environmental archaeology, revealed survival strategies
that show an unyielding, highly connected system that would fold under the many
pressures of the early modern period. Yet the seeds of a new system that would allow
Iceland to survive and eventually prosper are apparent in these analyses as well. Panarchy
theory offers an engaging framework to explain these transformations.

[261] Energy and information flows form complex networks in hunter-gatherer social
systems
Hunter-gatherer societies are embedded within complex ecosystems, systems structured
by the flows of energy and information between organisms and their environments. Hunter-
gatherers harvest resources from these ecosystems to meet basic energetic, reproductive,
and material requirements. Within the constraints of human life history we show that
hunter-gatherers optimize the flow of energy and information by forming complex social
networks. These complex networks are ubiquitous in nature wherever flows of energy
and/or information are optimized within system constraints. We show that the quantitative
signatures of such complex systems, scale-free probability distributions, are found in both
hunter-gatherer ethnographic and archaeological data.

This paper offers a critical evaluation of conventional scholarship surrounding early

view has deflected scholarship in the steppe region from questions concerning
metallurgical production, consumption, trade and value, and their connection to local
diachronic socio-cultural changes. This paper examines these key issues through recent
research programs in the steppe region and in so doing offers an important comparative
case study for early metallurgy and its relationship to trajectories of socio-cultural change.

environment constrained their cultural trajectory. Here, I examine the agricultural practices
the Hohokam employed as increasing population density and societal complexity escalated
the demands made on their food production system. I suggest that the necessary flexibility
of farming techniques and relatively low carrying capacity of the land countered a path
toward centralization.

The histories of Native Americans in the Eastern U.S. have been poorly recorded,

indigenous strategies of maintaining low visibility in those contexts. The Monacan Indians
of Virginia were one such 'low visibility group' for whom past and present became
disconnected. Now, the Monacans are rewriting their history for a broad public audience.
Collaborative archaeology has helped bring Monacan history into the present. This paper
examines that collaboration, which stresses listening, local interests, and an on-going
conversation which does not essentialize Monacan but examines the historical interplay of
continuity and change.

[54] Geophysical Investigations at Cahokia: Methodological Issues and Future Directions
Cahokia was the largest, most complex prehistoric settlement in North America north of
Mexico. Today a portion of this World Heritage site (2,200 acres and 68 mounds) is
preserved as an Illinois State Historic Site. Given the depth and complexity of deposits, and
emphasis on preservation, traditional archaeological techniques cannot be expected to
provide a comprehensive understanding of the site’s developmental history and internal
organization. Previous and ongoing investigations have demonstrated the benefits of
geophysical approaches. Methodological issues are discussed, including the development
of research questions, suitability of particular techniques, sampling, and need for
independent evaluation of geophysical results.

[23] Identity and Diversity in the Figurines from Chalcatzingo, Morelos, Mexico
The anthropomorphic figurines from Chalcatzingo have received a good deal of past
attention and studies have revealed correlations with emerging community stratification,
gender relations and, potentially, cult behavior associated with a ruling elite. Each of these
past studies has been limited either by the scale at which variability was addressed or by
concentrating on only a subset of the figurines. The present discussion attempts a broader
perspective on iconographic variation while at the same time employing a finer scale of
analysis to address issues of identity and diversity.

[163] Water, Wetlands and Problems of Landscape Change in Site Location Analysis: A
Case Study from the Late Prehistoric Eastern Woodlands
Proximity to water sources and wetland environments has frequently been identified as
strongly predictive of sensitivity for prehistoric archeological site location. While there are
strong correlations between site location and distance to wetlands or a water source,
landscape change following site formation often renders such spatial relationships
problematic, even for late prehistory. GIS-based research into the Late Woodland
settlement pattern of Southern Maryland indicates that such proximity data are best used in
multi-variate analyses, and in conjunction with data pertinent to additional physiographic
characteristics of surrounding landforms, such as distance to drainage features and soil
association.

Although archaeology programs have been established in Florida, it has been mostly a
grassroots effort by a passionate few. The creation of the Florida Public Archaeology
Network (FPAN) lends resources to this trend that were once not available. Staff at these

opportunity to develop, implement, and support archaeological curricula in schools.
Working with teachers, administrators, and volunteers, FPAN has started to highlight the

resharpening where edges are "rejuvenated" by steep unifacial flaking. Here, we
demonstrate that beveling the blade edges of bifaces also provides performance
improvements for ballistic properties. Using mathematical models and wind tunnel results
we demonstrate that beveling produces differential pressures on alternate sides of a biface
that causes rotation when velocities exceed 18 mps.

[149] Modeling Long-term Temporal and Spatial Patterns of Holocene Land Use at Lake
Turkana, Kenya
Archaeological investigations regarding land use, resource utilization, and population shifts
during the Holocene in the Lake Turkana region have been conducted since 2000. This
multi-scale landscape archaeological project implicitly incorporates archaeological,
geological and paleoenvironmental investigations conducted at varying scales to detect,
elicit and understand both the environmental and the human dimensions of temporal and
spatial patterning. By combining studies of the modern paleo-land surface of landforms and
remnant Holocene geomorphology (using aerial photography and satellite-based remotely
sensed data), paleoenvironmental and geological data of past faunal and flora populations,
with large-scale excavations and extensive surface survey hypotheses about land and
resource use, population migrations, and long-distance resource utilization can begin to be
addressed. This paper will report on the project and comment on the dietary and resource
utilization shifts between hunter-gatherers, fishers, and pastoralists during a 6,000 year
period.

[209] Influence of the Fur Trade on Northern Interior Plateau Social Organization:
Theoretical and Interpretive Implications
This paper questions the appropriateness of direct ethnographic analogies in
archaeological interpretation on the Canadian Plateau by exploring the direct and indirect
effects of the fur trade on Plateau social organization. Preliminary analysis of historic and
ethnographic data indicate introduction of the clan/class/potlaching system to the interior
ca. AD 1800, resulting from heightened interaction via trade and intermarriage between
coastal and interior groups beginning with the onset of the European fur trade in the Pacific
Northwest, ca. AD 1785. Implications of these findings include the need to re-assess
interpretive methodologies and to re-evaluate theories of emergent complexity in the
region.

[168] Chronological indicators in lithic debitage from the southwest German Mesolithic
Surface survey provides a means to address archaeological questions that cannot be
answered through excavation alone. However, survey data is often difficult to integrate into
regional views due to problems in dating surface assemblages, especially in earlier time
periods such as the Mesolithic where lithic assemblages are small. Analysis of diagnostic
artifacts alone can produce a distorted classification. Changes in production technology in
debitage can provide a more accurate means to assign a possibly mixed surface
assemblage to the correct time period or periods. An example from the southwest German
Mesolithic illustrates the potential for debitage analysis.

Styles of Terminal Classic Maya Ceramics
Current archaeological studies of social identity suggest that traits tend to merge or blur at
the margins of social units and scholars emphasize the need for more sophisticated ways

chemical and compositional analyses of ceramic material, this research seeks to address
the complexities of foreign interaction and integration that occurred in the Sibun Valley

[202] The Tyranny of Trajectories: Examining Land-Use through a Contextual Analysis of
Biface Use and Replacement
This study examines the topic of hunter-gatherer land-use by pairing production trajectory
models with systemic contextual analyses. Flaked stone tools from 29 assemblages on
California’s central coast dating between 9,500 and 500 cal. years B.P. are examined.
These analyses demonstrate that it is the manner and location of biface replacement,
rather than biface production, that is most revealing in terms of land-use patterning. A
dramatic shift in biface replacement patterns approximately 3,000 years ago coincides with
a sudden increase in population density and likely reflects a change from a forager to a
collector lifeway.

[315] Is the Hydraulic Hypothesis Dead Yet? Irrigation and Social Change in Ancient
Yemen
Irrigation played an important role throughout the history of ancient Yemen; large-scale

to reconsider links between irrigation and social change. The hydraulic hypothesis is
seriously, perhaps fatally, flawed and new perspectives are required to move beyond the
confines of unicausal determinism. This paper examines millennia-long connections
between sociopolitics and the increasing technical and organizational complexity of
irrigation in ancient Yemen. Irrigation not only generated food to sustain burgeoning
populations but additionally afforded leaders the ideological prestige of commanding

Over the last two decades, archaeological practice has been transformed as many
archaeologists have sought a more equitable discipline and research that promotes social
justice. Feminist critiques of research and practices, as well as the increasing numbers of

manifestation of these changes is the increasing collaboration among archaeologists and

[309] Technology Adoption and the Shift from Stone to Metal in Late Prehistoric Anatolia
Chipped and ground stone technologies, significant components of Neolithic and
Chalcolithic sites in the Middle East, began to decline in importance in the Bronze Age.
Previous studies of this shift from stone to metal have suggested that the generally
assumed superiority of metal tools was not the main cause for their adoption. Instead, the
shift was likely related to greater social complexity and developing craft specialization
(Rosen 1996). Using lithic data from Chalcolithic, Bronze Age and Iron Age sites in
southeastern Anatolia, I assess the gradual alterations in the lithic industry over this period
as the bronze industry emerges.

[268] One Man’s Castle is Another Man’s Dún: The Integration of Gaelic-Irish Tower
Houses into Old English Vernacular Architecture in Galway, Ireland
In the town of Galway, Ireland, in the late and post-medieval periods, the elite ‘Old English’
population marked its difference from the Gaelic-Irish hinterland even as it distanced itself
from the English colonial administration; it was ‘English’ to one and ‘Irish’ to the other.
Materially, this tension appears as the abandonment of the feudal feasting hall and the
adoption of individual ‘castles’ that were constructed for the elite families. These castles are
considered to be urban counterparts to a distinctly Gaelic-Irish tradition of tower houses
that are prominent in the Gaelic-Irish countryside as the seats of late medieval indigenous
power.

First Nations have begun asserting ownership of their own past. Archaeology in British
Columbia is inherently tied to this past and will be required to confront issues inextricably

The metamorphosis necessitates revisiting the role archaeology has played in First Nations
communities. This is necessary because First Peoples are healing and transforming and
becoming more proactive in their effort toward self-determination. Archaeology must adapt
as Indigenous and non-Indigenous roles and positioning shift. To resolve any conflicts
stemming from colonial concepts, Indigenous communities are insisting on indigenizing the

Claims of supernatural knowledge have probably always been used to claim superiority and

over surplus production provides in transegalitarian societies, ritual power must have
always been ephemeral. Precisely how exclusive ritual claims were used in consolidating
political power is still relatively unexplored. More obvious developments include: ancestor
cults, secret societies, and hierarchical shamanistic fraternities. In order to interpret these
developments, archaeologists need to know more about the kinds of ritual spaces
associated with ritual strategies, which is an issue.

Modern Western concepts of spirituality tend to compartmentalize individual and societal

fields, while deteriorated by modern farming, are identifiable. We have found more that
50km2 of raised fields in this area, making it comparable with the Huata and Pomata
complexes. Hydrological calculations show how the fields would perform under variability of
altiplano rainfall. We find that Rio Ramis, unlike water from runoff or qochas, would have
been a surprisingly dependable source. Variation in location, size and complexity of the
fields identified may reflect increasing complexity of underling economic and political
systems as the region developed.

[227] Formative Honduras and Olmec style
Excavations in northern Honduras produced evidence of local expressions of widely shared
Formative Period material practices and visual imagery often interpreted as signatures of
the Gulf Coast Olmec. Interaction with other regions is clearly indicated by obsidian
compositional analyses. Pottery with widespread Mesoamerican imagery is locally made at
Puerto Escondido. Iconographic analysis demonstrates unique Honduran choices of theme,
medium, and scale in pottery, and later in greenstone figures and monumental sculpture.
The use of cacao beverages is a precocious practice at Puerto Escondido. These findings
challenge the idea that Honduran communities were asymmetrical receivers of “influence”
from other regions.

[155] A Common Space: Lake Amatitlan and Volcan Pacaya in the Cosmology of Highland
Guatemala and Escuintla
This paper addresses the crucial role once played by Lake Amatitlán and Volcán Pacaya in
the lives of surrounding Maya groups, focusing particularly on the manner in which the
region is represented in the archaeological record of Kaminaljuyú and Escuintla. The
myriad ways in which this landscape was integrated into the iconography and ritual of these
areas demonstrate that it occupied a particularly sacred place in the cosmology of diverse
populations. In other words, Lake Amatitlán and Volcán Pacaya crossed linguistic and
ethnic boundaries, profoundly affecting, even shaping, the way in which a diverse region
viewed its world.

Groupings within Communities or Regions
The large site of Cerro Palenque and the Copan Valley, both in Honduras and both at their

analysis. The paper explores what can be learned about these societies through the study
of how domestic and monumental buildings are clustered within the community, in the case
of Cerro Palenque, or region, in the case of Copan, as a whole. The paper aims to work at
a scale intermediate between that of the individual building or group of structures and that

[278] Developing a Prey Choice Model for the Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene on
Idaho's Snake River Plain
In investigating the role of bison in aboriginal subsistence on the eastern Snake River Plain,
hypotheses generated through the quantitative analysis of behavioral ecological models
can be evaluated against archaeological evidence within the region. Although a prey choice
model comparing the net caloric return rates of bison with other available resources has
already been developed from sites dating to the middle and late Holocene, our current
understanding of prey choice on the Snake River Plain during the terminal
Pleistocene/early Holocene is extremely poor. Additional research at Owl Cave can
potentially provide tremendous insights into human subsistence during this time period.

[314] Formative Era Oaxacan Figurines and the Mimetic Faculty
This paper uses theories related to mimesis, alterity, and the development of human
sociality to propose a hypothetical reconstruction of the social contexts of ceramic figurines
as they functioned in ancient coastal Oaxaca, Mexico. The construction and use, perhaps
during public ritual, of such miniature ceramic models exemplifies what has been termed
the ‘human mimetic faculty.’ Figurines represent the interests of an ancient people who
sought to mimetically capture the essence of humans, animals, ancestor spirits, and
perhaps characters from spiritual realms through the production of small-scale depictions.

The large time period between the initial domestication of plant species in the southeastern

While human settlement proliferated in the Rub al-Khali desert of southeastern Arabia

thought to have been too harsh to support permanent occupation in subsequent periods.
However, the Dubai Desert Survey has recently recorded several archaeological sites
located far from modern hydrologic resources that suggest permanent desert settlement as
late as the Iron Age (c.500 BC). The existence of these sites challenges a presumed linear
relationship between settlement and climate change, and instead supports more complex
models for human-environment dynamics in arid regions like the Arabian Desert.

[184] Unresolved Taphonomic Histories, Interpretive Equivalence, and Paleoindian Faunal
Exploitation
Large scale inferences addressing Paleoindian faunal exploitation are grounded in direct
zooarchaeological evidence from only a handful of sites that, collectively, encompass large
geographic areas, long time spans, and diverse site settings. Research and documentation
protocols amongst these key assemblages are highly variable and too often characterized
by unresolved taphonomic histories. In order to make sense of this situation, interpretive
equivalency has traditionally been assumed, either explicitly or implicitly, with statements
about diet and subsistence activities couched in terms of monolithic, time-averaged
behavioral summaries. Drawing on examples from our research, this paper outlines a
series of analytical tools designed to move inferential methods in zooarchaeology beyond
static, monolithic generalizations toward more specific details of resource selection and
carcass transport and processing, with implications for social organization, mobility, and
technology.

Despite a growing corpus of innovative applications, soil micromorphology continues to be

more vigorous application of the technique. Toward that end I cite case studies that
demonstrate how the technique can both confirm and contradict site formation hypotheses
first proposed in the field. I emphasize micromorphology’s broad potential with examples

[168] Isotopes, collagen, and degradation: New evidence from pyrolysis GC-MS and solid
state carbon-13 NMR
Degradation of archaeological collagen changes its carbon-to-nitrogen ratio, suggesting
molecular alterations that could shift isotopic ratios used to estimate diet. We use pyrolysis
GC-MS and solid state carbon-13 NMR to track molecular changes in collagen as C/N
increases. Major chemical transformations begin at a C/N of 3.2, not 3.6. For degraded
collagen, Pyr/GC-MS yields fewer products of multiple compared to single amino acids,
while Pyr/GC-MS and NMR show oxygenated alkanes. This suggests collagen degradation
involves denaturation and deamination of R-group nitrogen, then hydrolysis, deamination of
peptide nitrogen, and association with non-collagen compounds or alkane formation from
deaminated amino acids.

[270] Where is That Job? Hunter-Gatherer Information Systems in Complex Social
Environments in the Eastern Kalahari Desert, Botswana
This paper addresses ways in which hunter-gatherers acquire and disseminate information
on the natural and social environments in which they reside. Drawing on data from
fieldwork among San hunter-gatherers in the eastern Kalahari Desert, Botswana, an effort
is made to explain how foragers obtain information (for example, by looking at tracks of
animals or talking to other about where jobs are or police or game scouts are operating)
and how that information is disseminated. The long-term viability of hunter-gatherer groups
is based as much on social information as it is on knowledge about the distribution of
natural resources.

[69] Continuity in Animal Resource Diversity in the Upper Paleolithic Diet of Central
Portugal
Current research shows anatomically modern foragers exploited relatively diverse animal
resources throughout the Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic of central Portugal. These
include large and medium ungulates, rabbits, birds, and marine resources. Regional
analyses indicate continuity in the intensity of rabbit carcass utilization from the Early Upper
Paleolithic to Early Holocene. Similar patterns are apparent in large game assemblages
although many sites lack necessary taphonomic analyses. Marine resources were utilized
as early as 30,000 BP but the intensity of use through the Upper Paleolithic is not well
known. The cumulative evidence suggests dietary diversification prior to the Terminal
Pleistocene.

[276] The emergence of ‘history houses’ at Çatalhöyük
This paper examines the quantitative evidence for variation in the ‘status’ of buildings at
Çatalhöyük. It is shown that there are positive relationships between the size and
architectural elaboration of buildings. There is also evidence that larger and more elaborate
buildings have more space for storage and production. When buildings are rebuilt over
time, in sequences which may cover 250-400 years, repeated changes occur. Buildings
become more elaborate, sometimes larger, and they have more burials. They seem to
accumulate ‘history’. It is possible that ‘history houses’ manage to convert productive
success into control of ancestors and ritual elaboration.

[60] Spit Growth and Architectural Space of Shell Middens: Three Case Studies in Puget
Sound, Washington
Shoreline features, such as spits, are often sensitive recorders of the land-ocean interface.
In this paper I discuss and compare the formation histories and depositional geometries of
three archaeological shell midden sites located on late Holocene spits in Puget Sound,
western Washington. Though the geomorphic processes responsible for spit formation are
similar for all three landforms, local spatio-temporal conditions have created distinct spit
histories. By examining changes in spit depositional geometry through time, the creation of
archaeological space on these landforms can be related to the geomorphic events and
processes of spit emergence and growth.

[240] Mobility and exchange from a pan-Caribbean perspective: an overview
Prehistoric Amerindian community members participated in interaction networks of human
mobility and exchange of goods and ideas, guided by their cosmovision, technology and
socio-political organisation. The urge to garner status, thereby defining group and individual
identity, and the desire for access to myriad materials and products formed important
motivations. This paper searches for interaction networks operating between 6000 BC and
the early Colonial period in the Caribbean from a pan-regional perspective. The adoption of
a diachronic, broad geographic perspective will help evaluate the structure through time of
these social networks at local, archipelagic and - uniquely - pan-Caribbean scales.

Excavations at a late 19th century cemetery in 2005 led to the recovery of 16 burials. One
individual (Burial 15, a young female), exhibited black stains on the buccal dentition,
marked on the anterior maxillary teeth. The unusual color and patterning of the staining
made macroscopic identification difficult. We were interested in determining whether
contamination was associated with a cultural trait such as smoking or chewing tobacco or if
staining occurred posthumously. LA-TOF-ICP-MS and scanning electron microscopy were
employed to address these questions. The results show heavy concentrations of iron on
the dentition were most likely caused by posthumous contamination.

composite organic projectile point with microblade insets, a weapon lethal enough to take
high ranked animals, e.g., mammoth, bison, and horse. Horses were likely hunted in central
Alaska until about 14,000 cal B.P. Mammoths were contemporary with humans in Alaska

Intensified interaction with “Kahiki” c. A.D. 1200-1400 altered Hawaii’s agricultural,
demographic, and political history. Adoption of the newly-introduced staple sweet potato
(Ipomoea batatas) made possible major expansion of cultivation in lands too arid for
previously available crops, resulting in rapid population growth between c. 1400 and 1550.
Having reached natural limits, significant agricultural expansion ceased, resulting in near-
zero population growth between c. 1550 and 1778. Competition among high-ranked chiefs
for newly limited resources and the decoupling of the chiefly and commoner classes
contributed to the emergence, during the 17th and 18th centuries, of competing archaic
states.

[315] Traces of Wear on Ceramics: Food Preparation at a Halaf Period Site
Our understanding of cuisines prepared in the ancient past is skewed by misconceptions of
time. Resulting from stereotypes of earlier societies as being less advanced technologically
and therefore unsophisticated in their food, it is dehumanizing to assume that prehistoric
peoples ate nothing other than raw meat and gruel. Ceramic use alteration allows for the
examination of ceramic vessel usage in food preparation activities through analysis of
sooting/carbonization, use wear and absorbed residues. This methodology has been
applied to the Halaf coarse ware assemblage from Fýstýklý Höyük, Turkey, to recreate the
community’s food preparation activities and how food shaped their labor.

[8] In the Crossfire of Canons: Military Laundresses at Fort Vancouver, Washington
Fort Vancouver in SE Washington was headquarters for Pacific Northwest military
exploration and campaigns in the last half of the nineteenth century. Living onsite in
designated quarters were officers and their families, soldiers, and various support workers.
Recent excavations at the laundresses’ quarters provides material evidence of how these
females negotiated their social identities in relation to the military community’s expectations
during a time of changing perceptions of womanhood and femininity in the larger society.
The Fort’s long-term archaeological and historical research programs provide contextual
and comparative information on social use of material culture by other segments of the
community.

and cold working small tools and implements to shape. After 1150 C.E. metalworkers used
copper alloys, copper-tin, copper-arsenic, to redesign the objects previously made in
copper. On-going archaeological work at sites in the Cuenca de Sayula Jalisco by Johan
Garcia and colleagues shows that around 1100 C.E. Jalisco metalworkers with cultural
affiliations around Autlan in southern Jalisco used copper-tin and copper-arsenic alloys. At
the site of Atoyac also in the Cuenca de Sayula, peoples with local cultural affiliations
(Amacueca) also used bronze, and objects made from these alloys and copper-silver
appear in a subsequent Tarascan-Amacueca ocupation. These Jalisco data provide the
first opportunity a decisively link cultural affiliations, dates, and metalworking materials and
techniques and provoke new questions concerning the evolutionary trajectory of this
technology.

[106] The Complexity of “Non-Complex” Societies: Mobility and Centrality among Mobile
Pastoralists of Central Mongolia
The tendency for pastoral groups to exploit marginal environments through high mobility
and spatially extensive economies has led many scholars to argue that nomadic
pastoralism is not conducive to political centralization nor to the emergence of
institutionalized social hierarchy without regular interaction with state-level societies, i.e. the
‘dependency’ hypothesis. However, the Mongolian case is particularly perplexing, since
impressive Late Bronze Age monuments suggest the appearance of early societal
complexity some time before regular interaction with large sedentary states such as China.
Ongoing settlement archaeology in Central Mongolia is slowly clarifying these issues—thus
evaluating how complex these mobile pastoralist societies actually were.

[257] Power in Production or Power over Production?
Lowland Maya elites played key roles in shaping patterns of demand, manufacturing
priorities and in the circulation of valued cultural materials during the Classic period. In the
Postclassic and Colonial periods, did these patterns remain consistent, or did they change?
Are emergent patterns connected to changes in elite structure and identity? Does what we
know about the production of material culture items provide insight into changing systems
of power and the economic implications of such changes? We draw from the results of
excavations and pottery studies at Lamanai to address these questions, shedding light on

Effigies
Ancient Maya cache goods are often seen as offerings to gods, to buildings, or to
ancestors, but analysis of cache items suggests that they often had previous use-lives, and
were not simply produced for the ritual. If these cache items were used, at least some of
them, then how were they socially transformed from one "type" of item into another, how
were they collected and chosen, and what might have been the relationship between how
they were used before they were gifted to the gods? Of particular interest are god effigies
that may not have been perceived as terrestrially owned.

[273] Geological Context of Shell Midden Sites along the Northern Sonoran Coast
Geological processes have played an important role in shaping the Sonoran coast and
creating foraging opportunities for indigenous peoples. Shallow offshore slopes in the
northern Gulf of California result in large tidal ranges and shifts in shoreline due to eustatic
sea level rise and localized tectonic uplift. Eustatic sea level began to stabilize ~ 6000-5000
years ago allowing the development of large estuaries and lagoons along tectonically
stable segments of the coast. New 14C dates on terrestrial organics from buried shell
midden layers indicate that Middle Archaic foragers were utilizing newly formed coastal
ecosystems soon after sea level stabilization.

[127] Assessing the 'Grip-ability' of Ceramic Surface Treatments in the American Northeast
Numerous studies have examined the performance characteristics of ceramics. One of the
areas that remains to be studied is the comparative ability of surface treatments to allow
the ceramic to be easily held – the "grip-ability". This is particularly important when forms
assumed to operate primarily as held artifacts, show considerable variability in surface
treatment. In the American Northeast this is particularly important because of the significant
variation in the types of surface treatment; namely, indention, corrugation, stamping, as
well as others. In this study, the grip-ability is quantitatively analyzed using several
measures of mechanical friction.

[175] The Ecological and Social Frameworks of Athapaskan Resource Use in Northern
British Columbia
Athapaskan traditional resource use strategies in British Columbia involved access to
various riverine, lake, and terrestrial resources. While kinship groups controlled key
production areas, fluctuations in the resource base were accommodated by various
strategies to access resources in other areas, facilitated by marriage ties linking groups in
the Fraser River, Skeena River (both of which supported salmon runs), and Peace River
watersheds. Key fishing lakes also provided an economic fallback in times of diminished
salmon runs. These resource use patterns influenced settlement patterns and, by
inference, the sharing of technology - likely reflected in the archaeological record.

Recent research refines previous interpretations about the role climate played in the
development of Mapungubwe. First, the Medieval Warm Epoch started at about AD1000,
rather than 900. Secondly, dry conditions between AD1200 and 1250 affected farming
societies over a wide area. Thirdly, Mapungubwe was probably abandoned about AD1300
in part because of cold conditions at the onset of the Little Ice Age, causing more flooding
and saturated floodplains. Agricultural failures probably undermined sacred leadership,
contributing to Mapungubwe's abandonment and shift in power to Great Zimbabwe.

farming practices. Strontium ratios of humans, domesticated animals, and local soils were
analyzed from an early Anglo-Saxon cemetery in the upper Thames River valley to
ascertain residential mobility and herding practices. The human ratios point to the presence
of several non-local women in a predominantly sedentary local population, and limited
mobility in herding practices.

later with European disease, slave trading, and other abuses.

produce cordage and fabric are possible solutions to this functional puzzle. Ethnographic
evidence and archaeological remains suggested activities connected with plant bast fibre
production. Experiments have shown the activities which best match the archaeological

evidence has been able to suggest new chaines operatoires for perishable organic material

In physical, biological, and social terms, a watershed acts simultaneously as both

occupying most, if not all, of a river basin. At some time in the Late Holocene, likely within
the last millennium, the Nooksack River avulsed from a channel flowing north, where it
terminated as one of the largest tributaries to the Fraser River, to a channel west into the
Strait of Georgia, where it created a new estuary. New evidence for this interbasinal
avulsion demands reconsideration of the sociocultural and archaeological consequences of
watershed reconfiguration.

[308] A Context for Missouri River Eagle Traps in North Dakota
Eagle trap sites are documented in Great Plains ethnographic literature and they are
occasionally found in archaeological contexts during river basin surveys. Eagles and their
traps remain as important to present indigenous groups as they were to pre-contact groups.
However, few studies of this fascinating site type exist. This paper summarizes both
ethnographic data and published archaeological evidence of eagle traps and compares
them to several traps recently relocated along the Missouri River in North Dakota.

[162] “Megadroughts” and the 15th Century Depopulation of Central and Southern Arizona
The 15th century depopulation of central and southern Arizona is a classic problem in
Southwestern archaeology with no consensus as to its causes. Two severe and sustained
“megadroughts” during the late 1300s and mid-1400s in the western U.S. have been
identified (by others) using tree-ring reconstructed summer Palmer Drought Severity
Indices. These droughts were more severe and prolonged than any witnessed in this region
during the period of instrumental weather observations. They are also temporally coincident
with the depopulation of central and southern Arizona. This presentation will evaluate the
possible influence these events had on the 15th century regional depopulation.

Excavations at the rapidly abandoned site of Aguateca have provided unique evidence on
the production, exchange, and possession of symbolically charged objects. Some of them
were left in elite residences where high-status artists produced such objects, while others
were placed in a storage room of the royal palace. Some items were broken and deposited
during terminal rituals of the palace and temples. Artifacts found in these different contexts

[29] Reversed ontogenies in stone tools: a new method for investigating use-lives of
Paleolithic artifacts
Resharpening has been used to explain lithic variability within Paleolithic, Paleoindian, and
Australian contexts, by proposing that morphological types represent stages in a continuum
of re-use. The focus of this paper is to switch the emphasis from individual tool morphology
to the geometric properties of the reduction continua. This is similar to comparing
ontogenetic trajectories in biological organisms, except that size decreases. The method
presented is based on elliptical Fourier analysis of tool contours and its application pertains
to comparing bifacial and unifacial industries from the Middle Paleolithic of Europe from a
use-life point of view.

[257] Producing Power: Textual Documentation of Specialized Resources and the
Construction of Difference in the Classic Maya World
Archaeological understanding of hierarchical differentiation in Classic Maya society rests
upon a conception of differential distribution of key materials. These important substances

this context must treat the production and distribution of both tangible and intangible
containers of power, and examine the ways in which particular segments of the population
controlled these special stuffs. This paper examines emic assertions of power production

The ancient American Southwest was occupied at a low density of settlements who
experienced a large variability of rainfall and resource availability. Based on ceramic
remains, it is believed settlements interacted with each other at large distances in order to
cope with the spatial and temporal variability. This paper describes an agent-based model
to explore the ways settlements may have developed exchange networks to buffer

[101] Dune Dwellers of the Gobi: Specialized Use of Holocene Playas in the Mongolian
Desert
The term “specialization” is commonly used to describe the adoption of an adaptive
mechanism that allows hunter-gatherers to heavily exploit one type of plant or animal.
During the Holocene, post-glacial foragers in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia began
seasonally exploiting resources along playa margins using a new range of technologies,
like pottery and grinding stones. This shift in exploitation strategies has been taken as
evidence of incipient cultivation, but the distribution of such technologies – small numbers
of pottery sherds and grinding stones amidst large flaked stone assemblages – suggests
instead, the specialized exploitation of various seasonal playa resources.

Witchcraft played an interesting and potentially subversive role in colonial New Mexico. In a

Spaniards outranked Castas and Pueblos within colonial society, in the context of witchcraft

Settlement ecology encompasses research into the factors, both environmental and
sociopolitical, that influence the settlement patterns of a culture. The Haudenosaunee
(Iroquois) had a semi-sedentary settlement pattern and a horticultural subsistence system
in a temperate climate. In addition, evidence of intergroup violence in the Northeast/Great
Lakes region stretches far back in history. Consequently, Haudenosaunee settlement
patterns from AD 1500 to AD 1700 reflect the often-changing constellation of environmental
and sociopolitical factors that influenced the settlement decisions of communities just prior
to contact and during contact.

[319] Pre-Columbian Human/Environmental Interactions on Antigua, West Indies:
Palynological Implications from a Sediment Core
The analysis of pollen from a continuous sediment core collected in Antigua has revealed a
complex history of human activities over the past several thousand years. Samples from
near the base of the 4.7 meter core document Archaic period activities and possibly the
period of earliest human colonization of the island. A sequence of volcanic ash lenses,
although undated at present, appear to coincide with Saladoid occupations, and
fluctuations in particulate carbon identify past human activities in the area. Agricultural
efforts, regional site abandonment and colonial historical activities are also documented in
the first core from this little-studied island.

Recent excavations at four sites along Jones Spring Draw at the base of Red Mountain in

desert of southwest New Mexico. The suite of sites was occupied during the Early and Late
Pithouse periods and the attractiveness of the study area to the prehistoric populations

Quebrada Jaguay in southern coastal Peru is one of the oldest fishing sites known in the
Americas. Radiocarbon dates on charcoal from site QJ-280 range from terminal
Pleistocene (11,343 ± 300 14C yBP) to early Holocene (7500 ± 130 14C yBP). We
summarize the radiocarbon chronology of Quebrada Jaguay, report new pairs of
radiocarbon dates on charcoal and mollusk shells that we consider to have been deposited
contemporaneously in the early Holocene, and discuss implications of these paired dates
for the marine reservoir correction and thus radiocarbon dating of marine samples in Peru.

comparative highland forms and a contextual analysis of the plaza’s visual program, I posit
that the object represents a bodiless head with looped hair. This identification prompts

Sea otters are the primary keystone predator in kelp forests along the coast of California. A

suggest that while the species was taken in large numbers in a seemingly non-conservative
fashion, populations remained viable throughout the span of prehistoric exploitation and
habitats remained stable.

Investigations of environmental dynamics and archaeology in the western Gulf of Alaska -
eastern Aleutian archipelago reveal patterns of long-term resilience and adaptation of
human populations to pronounced climatic, geologic, and ecologic variability. Middens,
terrestrial and marine sediment cores, and coastal geomorphology record fluctuations in
regional climate (e.g. Neoglaciation, MWP, LIA), short and long-term geological
disturbance, and changes in marine productivity (regime shifts) that co-occur with shifting
human adaptive strategies manifest in house form, village organization, and artifact and
faunal assemblages. The integration of these proxy data sets suggests strong, multi-scale
reciprocal links between humans and the North Pacific ecosystem.

[71] Practising Meaning in the Rock Art Traditions of Northern Eurasia
The hunter gatherer cultures of northern Eurasia share striking similarities in cosmology,
worldview and the ritualised veneration of 'natural' landscape features. Close analysis of
these ethnographic accounts provides archaeologists with productive frameworks for
understanding the creation of meaning in the rock art traditions of northern Europe. This
approach rejects the notion that rock art is merely a static 'reflection' of prehistoric
cosmology, and emphasises the 'active' roles played by key rock art sites in the wider
landscape. It also demonstrates that the ritualised experiences of creating the images hold
the key to understanding the art's original significance.

[243] Alternative Explanations of Prehistoric Shellfish Collecting Along the Central
California Coast: Human Behavioral Ecology or Spatial Variation in Intertidal Communities?
Determining evidence of subsistence intensification in faunal assemblages include
observable shifts in shellfish procurement strategies. Indications are often evidenced in an
expanded diet breadth and a reduction in size of taxa over time due to increased
harvesting. Although useful heuristic measures, an analysis of shellfish collections
spanning the Holocene along the northern San Luis Obispo coastline is revealing. Both the
relatively balanced array of shellfish species and the size of California mussel (Mytilus
californianus) are reflective of minor temporal variations in the productivity of intertidal
communities that appear more indicative of environmental conditions constraining the
growth of mature mussel beds.

[81] A Proposed Formal Definition for an Archaeological Site Using Basic Formal Ontology
This paper applies basic concepts from Basic Formal Ontology to the problem of identifying
and defining archaeological sites. Site identification has been the subject of controversy,
and somewhat radical solutions have been sought, ie. the advocation of removing “site”
from archaeology by Dunnell. By relying on a strict formal ontology this ambiguity can be
eliminated, allowing for standardized definitions which will facilitate data interoperability
between different archaeological projects. This application of BFO demonstrates that we
often use one word, “site,” to identify two different contexts, one present, and one past, and
that these meanings must be separated.

Models of sedentarisation among gatherer-hunter societies suggest that as residential shift
practices become focused on a smaller number of specific locations, so there is a
propensity for longer distance journeys to be undertaken. This paper will address how
disruptions in long-established residential shift patterning in the prehistoric Jomon period of

exchange networks. Exploring the animal imagery that appears in central Japan c.2500 BC,
and the nature of possible 'influences' from the East Asian mainland, the paper examines

[269] Upper Paleolithic emergence in Northern, Central and East Asia
Different models of the appearance of the Upper Paleolithic (population replacement,
independent development from local Middle Paleolithic complexes) are examined in
relation to tool typology, chronology, and environment. In Siberia, Central Asia, and
Mongolia, the Upper Paleolithic emerged from the local Middle Paleolithic from ca. 43,000
BP onwards, and the earliest Upper Paleolithic assemblages include Levallois-like artifacts.
The very early examples of art in southern Siberia testify in favor of the Upper Paleolithic
nature of these sites dated to ca. 35,000-40,000 BP. In China, continuity of Lower
Paleolithic technology with late Upper Paleolithic elements is characteristic after ca. 30,000

organized townships to exploit economic advantage in isolation. This island was the site of
an 18th century, isolated homestead. Following the historical sources, the university of
Mississippi in conjunction with the university of Connecticut conducted geophysical
prospection and archaeological excavations locating the 18th century Euro-American
settlement on the island. Project was directed by Benjamin Kelsey, masters candidate at
the university of Mississippi. Results include excavations of Euro-American settlement and
site formation processes.

[223] Ancient DNA: 20 Years of Research in the Americas
2008 marks the 20th anniversary of the first publication on DNA extracted from the remains
of a prehistoric Native American. Research in the ensuing two decades of this pioneering
study has produced dozens of reports on the genetic composition of ancient populations
from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. Temporal changes in genetic variation have also been
recorded by these studies, with data retrieved from specimens ranging in age from
hundreds to over 10,000 years old. What insights about the ancient Americas have we
gained through this line of inquiry? A summary of this research will be presented.

[311] The Challenges of Stone Circles at Camp Guernsey, Wyoming
Stone circles or “tipi rings” are relatively common across the American high plains. Thought
to represent the location where Plains Indians placed hide tents, they have posed
challenges to archaeologists when evaluating site significance and National Register
eligibility. They can also create unique management challenges. At Camp Guernsey, the
premier Wyoming Army National Guard training center, over 500 stone circles have been
documented. Native Americans have expressed particular interest in the protection of these
features. This paper presents the archaeological and ethnographic methods used to
consider the concerns of tribes while meeting the military training mission.

[306] Evidence of Pre-Clovis Butchering on a Bison antiquus from the Ayer Pond Site,
45SJ454, in Northwest Washington State
An apparently butchered Bison antiquus was found recently beneath a peat deposit on
Orcas Island. This discovery included a well-preserved skull dated to 11,760 ± 70 RCYBP,
and nearly 100 postcranial skeletal specimens. Recognized modifications include over 30
green bone fractures, two sets of rodent gnaw marks, three polished edges, eight points of
impact, three sets of parallel scratches, and at least two deep "V" section cut marks.
 Morethan 60 lower limb bones were whole and unmodified while the meatier elements
were missing. Significantly, no canid or scavenger "U" section gnawing marks were found
and artifacts in association were absent.

[246] Material Culture and Viking Age Trade: Comparison of Artifacts from Icelandic Farm
Sites

By analyzing and comparing the material culture from three Viking Age farm sites in north
central Iceland two competing hypotheses regarding North Atlantic trade are addressed.
Based on the quantities of imported material, the temporal change in composition of the
material assemblages, as well as considering the faunal analysis and fuel resource
utilization for these farms, it appears that the data supports the notion that trade between
this region of Iceland and continental Europe was minimal during the Viking Age.

[307] The Trouble with Lithic Scatters
Existing predictive models of prehistoric site location tend to be focused on subsistence
resources and environments. Archaeological sites preserved at locations where human
activities had little relation to subsistence remain the most difficult to effectively predict
using these methods. Lithic scatter is an example of a site type that can represent just such
a situation. The inability to predict these sites is of little consequence when the models are
created for facilitating CRM activities because encountering this site type during a
construction project would likely not significantly affect the cost of its completion. Missing
lithic scatters does, however, create a gap in the archaeological record. It is now possible
for archaeologists to restructure existing models to predict more specific site types, and
recapture this tool for archaeological investigation outside of commercial purposes. Critical
to this restructuring is pushing beyond how well models can predict in general and
redefining what these models can predict. Different site types in Allamakee County, Iowa
tend to be patterned differently in relation to the to chert outcrops. This factor can then be
used to differentiate areas where specific site types are more likely to occur.

The Joe Miller site in southern Wyoming offers a rare glimpse of elk processing during the
terminal Archaic. This is the only such elk processing site known in the plains/Rocky
Mountains region. Excavated in 1980 and 2006, the bone bearing component occurs in a
charcoal stained horizon with abundant fire-altered, charcoal stained rocks and rock-filled
basin heaths. At least 16 elk and four pronghorn appear to have been harvested in a spring
event that included intensive marrow extraction. This paper provides an overview of the site
with a focus on these faunal processing activities.

[225] Breath from the Stone: Black Mesa's Basalt Caves and Puebloan Emergence
Mythology in Central Northern New Mexico
Two basalt formations named Black Mesa exist along the Rio Grande in central northern
New Mexico. One, a well documented, small volcanic plug, occurs just north of San
Ildefonso Pueblo. Though known for the petroglyphs at its base, the more northern and
much larger Black Mesa has been, for the most part, neglected in early literature and
modern documentation. Atop this mesa is a series of basalt terraces riddled with crevices,
canyons, and caves. Tunnels and holes exist that open into the ground, emitting cold air.
These caves in relation to surrounding archaeology and Puebloan emergence mythology

[301] Northeast Yucatan in the Postcolonial Era: the development of underdevelopment
The northeast corner of modern Yucatan state, an affluent production zone on the eve of

How did radical 19th century world systems shifts – the rising economic power of the
United States and the rise of independence among Spain’s New World colonies – affect
this far corner of Mesoamerica? In this paper I consider the archaeological and
documentary evidence for this crucial period, during which local bootleggers and
international speculators plundered the region’s abundant resources and set the stage for
today’s unfortunate economic conditions.

Three extensive Early Bronze Age (c. 3500-2000 BCE) cemeteries on the southeastern
Dead Sea Plain in Jordan offer a unique opportunity to study mortuary practices at a time
when the social landscape changed dramatically as people moved into fortified towns for
the first time. Unfortunately these sites have suffered through decades of plundering due to
demand for whole vessels from Bab edh-Dhra, Safi, and Feifa. Beyond the immense loss of
data, this case study highlights the dynamic web of motivations and meanings attached to
looting and the illegal antiquities networks of the region.

[168] Rethinking Magdalenian Mobility
The image of highly mobile Magdalenian groups traversing the landscape has long been
considered conventional archaeological wisdom. However, recent studies suggest that
Magdalenian groups had varying mobility strategies. A number of researchers working in
the Périgord region of southwest France have hinted that Magdalenian populations in this
area may have even been sedentary. That any Magdalenian group may have been
sedentary challenges long-held assumptions about the lifeways of early European
populations. This research, focused on Magdalenian lithic assemblages, attempts to shed
light on the issue using principles of lithic raw material economy and efficiency to identify
changes in population mobility.

[19] What is a Hunter-Gatherer? Reflections from the Southeast
Recent developments in Southeastern archaeology indicate many populations employing
hunter-gatherer subsistence practices have levels of social, political, and economic
organization equal to or in some cases greater than food producing groups. I explore
dimensions of Southeastern “hunter-gatherer” social, political and economic complexity and
argue that a priori privileging of food production as the basis for persistent complexity
cannot be empirically sustained. This conclusion suggests we deemphasize
neoevolutionary stage typologies and consider specific variables that affect particular
societies, such as the capacity to create surpluses, to mobilize labor, and to situate change
within endogenous social and cultural processes.

[280] New Cave Discoveries at Quen Santo, Huehuetenango, Guatemala
In his exploration of the fissure containing Caves 2 and 3, Eduard Seler overlooked at least
five additional caves, all containing cultural material. While two are rather small, the
remaining caves add significantly to our understanding of the fissure. Cave 4 is the largest
enclosed space within the fissure and contained a masonry tomb. Cave 4 is only the
second cave to produce such features and its presence argues persuasively for elite
appropriation of the fissure. Expanding the distribution of elite cave burial into the western
Maya area suggests that the practice may be more common than previously appreciated.

At this stage it is only possible to comment on the social context of the earliest metallurgy
for the Nile Valley and for southern Africa - the intervening areas have seen too little

distinguish between adoption of metals and adoption of metallurgy; in southern Africa,
however, metals and metallurgy are synchronous and coincide with the adoption of

[227] Archaic to Formative Transition to Agriculture: The Gulf Coast Lowlands in
Mesoamerican Context
The transition to cereal based agriculture in Mesoamerica was a protracted process
stretching back in time several millennia in most areas. In the lowlands the process
appears to have involved a reliance on wild foods supplemented by cultivated plants such
as maize well into the Early Formative (1500-1000 B.C.) period and the rise of complex
societies such as the Olmec. This paper compares what is known about the transition in the
Gulf Coast lowlands to data from other areas of highland and lowland Mesoamerica. A
Mesoamerican-wide focus is argued necessary for understanding the early adoption of
cultigens, their slow rise to prominence in overall subsistence, and the effects of cereal
based agriculture on settlement patterns in most areas of the lowlands by Middle Formative
times (1000-500 B.C.).

[15] Opportunistic Leadership and Moving People: Political Economy and Population
Reorganization in the Bronze Age, Central-Western Korea
The transition from Early to Middle Bronze Age in central-western Korea witnessed drastic
regional-scale population reorganization accompanied with utilization of intensive rice-
farming technology and the emergence of complex social organization. The relationship
among these social, economic, and political shifts is explored, focusing on how differences
in rice production/distribution patterns among polities within the area, despite their
geographical proximity and similar environmental conditions, developed. It is argued that
regional-scale socioeconomic changes were spurred by the elites employing an
opportunistic leadership strategy to finance their newly-established political institutions and
that the inter-polity difference is attributable to the differing politico-economic interests of
elites.

Century BC in Southern Korea
In characterizing the post-migration relationship between hosts and migrants, some studies
consider it a one-to-one game. However, neither the hosts nor migrants are internally
coherent participants. Each consists of members/subgroups with different interests, and
constituents of each group respond to the opponents in different ways. An examination of
the migration of refugees from northeast China to southern Korea around the 4th century
BC shows that the elite of the host population selectively accepted the elite of the refugees
as a political partner to reinforce their political power. By contrast, lower class refugees
were neglected, sparsely distributed in marginal areas.

[94] Neanderthals and Cave bears in the Balve Cave, Germany
European caves are rich in remains of Cave bears which died during hibernation. Even in
caves which also yield Middle Palaeolithic occupations it is generally assumed that
Neanderthals didn’t contributed to the Cave bear thanatocoenosis and that both never met
inside these caves. So Cave bears in Middle Palaeolithic faunal assemblages serve as
indicators for palimpsests of alternating cave utilisations. The results of archaeozoologic
and thaphonomic analysis of the Cave bear population from the Balve Cave show that
Neanderthals had exclusive claims of using this cave and killed hibernating bears on a
regular basis.

dates firmly establishing Uxbenká as the earliest known center of sociopolitical complexity
in southern Belize. Continuing excavations in the site core and surrounding settlement
examine possible connections between southern Belize and the central Petén during the

rather than simply being the product of diffusion of political structures from external areas,
may have been to a significant degree a locally-based phenomenon.

[52] Building Relationships between Diverse Communities: Heritage Management,
Governance, and Distinct Identities in the Fraser Valley, B.C.
The Fraser Valley is home to communities with diverse interests, including the
management of heritage. These communities are represented by their local First Nations
and Municipal governments, who make decisions on heritage matters on behalf of their
residents. By assessing results from the perspectives of local representatives on
archaeology, I explore the relationship between heritage, governance, and community
identity. Rooted in heritage and expressed through governance, identity shapes Aboriginal
and non-Native communities in the Fraser Valley, and their interaction with each other.
Building relationships across these communities is necessary for effective heritage
management within the rapidly developing Fraser Valley landscape.

[267] The Social Dimensions of Production and Consumption Inside Late Classic Colha,

Research in the Late Classic Colha settlement revealed important internal differences
within the community. Significantly, not all households were engaged in tool production.
Many were involved in farming, some even in intensive agriculture. Excavation of selected
non-chertworking households showed there were differences, too, in the range and
qualities of tools and other materials available to their inhabitants. Simultaneous
investigations in chertworking households showed a more uniform distribution of goods
among them. However, analysis revealed important differences between workshops in how
tools were made. This paper explores the social implications of such variability within a
well-established, major production center.

Mortuary rituals include multiple meaningful acts that may both construct and convey social

statements about social life and community. Mortuary rituals there materialized interactions
of biological and social relatedness within the built prehistoric landscape. Using mortuary
and biodistance data, this study tests the hypothesis that ancestorhood was generated via
differential access to limited access mortuary program tracks. Changing mortuary practices
are argued to reflect shifting ideas about the relevance of ancestors to social life.

previous perceived, and the need for high-resolution archaeological and climate data in
order to understand middle-Holocene cultural reorganizations.

Indigenous archaeology is a growing force in the discipline in B.C. The idea of Indigenous

engaged in archaeological practice. These include the nature of Indigeniety, the politics and
practice of “archaeologies of protest”, and the concept of decolonization. Given the political
dimensions of these issues, it is not surprising that multiple and at times conflicting
theoretical voices inform this practice. Nonetheless, the emerging shift from a politicized
“Indigenous archaeology” to a theorized “internalist archaeology” may lead to a distinctive
practice that incorporates Indigenous perspectives and values.

considers a range of material evidence to critique the ‘colonization narrative’ that dominates
most interpretations of the end of the Late Bronze Age on Cyprus (1200-1000 BCE).
Cyprus’s material culture at this time reflects an amalgamation of Cypriot, Aegean and
even Levantine trends, and is representative of a new élite identity emerging on Cyprus.
Neither colonists nor conquerors, these migrants established new social identities as a
result of cultural encounters here defined as aspects of hybridization.

[235] Microwear Analysis of Slate Tools from a Paleoeskimo Site in Newfoundland
Microwear analysis was implemented in an attempt to determine the use of slate tools
found at Phillip’s Garden (EeBi-1), a Dorset Paleoeskimo site on the Great Northern
Peninsula of Newfoundland. It was hypothesized that slate tools were used in skin
processing activities. In an effort to test this hypothesis, reproductions of thirteen slate tools
were made and used to process two seal hides. A high-powered microscope was then
used to determine whether the artifacts’ microwear resembled that of the reproductions.

[261] Articulating scales in studying past social networks: a transdisciplinary approach
While archaeologists are perennially aware of various forms of human interconnectedness,
they have largely lacked workable methodologies to capture their nature. One means,
overlooked until recently, is social network analysis. Within this a gap is emerging between
‘microscopic’, agent-based approaches and ‘macroscopic’, systems-based approaches. In
our work, combining archaeology and statistical physics, we seek to avoid this polarity. Our
particular focus has been regional interaction networks in the Aegean Bronze Age, but here
we make some methodological points concerning this micro-macro split. We advocate a
‘mesoscopic’ approach that pays close attention to the nature and scale of both network
nodes and links.

[53] The Organization of Late Paleoindian Cody Complex Core Technology at the Hell Gap
Site
This paper continues with and expands on themes addressed in the Organization of Core
Technology (1987). Minimum analytical nodule analyses on core-bearing nodules from two
Cody complex components at the Hell Gap site provide clues to the on-site tool production
and off-site transport trajectories employed by these hunter-gatherers. The trajectories
include: (1) expedient on-site flake tool production, use and discard; (2) failed projectile
point production from a blocky-core flake blank; and (3) production and off-site transport of
flake tools or blanks from blocky and bifacial cores as part of a gearing-up trajectory.
Intercomponent patterns of technological organization are evaluated.

[179] All-seeing Eye: Lewis-Williams and Dowson’s entoptic model applied to the Andean
Huarpa ceramic art of the Early Intermediate Period.
Shamans communicate with spirits through an altered state of consciousness (ASC) from
induced hallucinogens. Initially, neurophysical processes affect the visual system to
produce involuntary “entoptic” images. Homo sapien sapien has not changed in 30,000
years so such images are depicted in many cultures. Geometric forms are common but,
also, unusual rotational symmetry occurs. Lewis-Williams and Dowson’s (1988) entoptic
model for the Upper Paleolithic rock art might also represent ASC and, perhaps,
shamanism. Their model and additional entoptic images are compared to the Huarpa
pottery style that displays many entoptic-like designs. Thus Huarpa society may have had a
shaman-based religious system.

In this paper I demonstrate that many celestial references contained in Classical Yucatec
language creation myths extant in colonial manuscripts were drawn from the literary
tradition that had produced the hieroglyphic codices in prehispanic times. Using references
to Venus as a test case, I address the methodological pitfalls involved in the use of
ethnohistorical sources to enrich our reconstructions of ancient cosmologies. Like Homeric

indicate that they and the cosmologies they contain are composites of several epochs.

[16] The Inalienability of Jades in Ancient Mesoamerica Among Elites and Nonelites
The rarity of the jade, its hardness, durability, and its sacred color gave it a value
incomparable to other materials in Mesoamerica. The investment of labor of the crafter, the
esoteric knowledge used create the objects, and the identity of the possessor(s) all
contributed to the legacy of jades as inalienable possessions. Jades were gifted, kept out of
sight, displayed, interred and even destroyed in honor of the inalienability, memory,
prestige, and identity of the object and the possessor, which were mutually constituted.
Evidence suggests that nonelites also possessed certain jades, which may have been
inalienable wealth.

the relationship of the archaeological site, including the archaeologists, to the local

continue to increase, such research has become critical, as there is a growing need for
archaeologists to view themselves more as cultural brokers with their own competing
interests in the site alongside other stakeholders.

(Fuller et al. 2007). It is clear that pottery in Northeast Asia preceded agriculture, and clay
containers were used by sedentary hunter-gatherers to store and process different types of
food.

[137] The Dynamics of Tribal Politics and the Distribution of Material Wealth: An Agent-
based Simulation
Archaeologists often use inequalities in the distribution of material wealth to infer social
complexity. I use data from the Kapauku of Irian Jaya, indicate that substantial inequality
can be present, even in tribally organized and simply ranked societies. Complex social
dynamics underlie this distribution of wealth, and I present results from an agent-based
model that elucidates some of the dynamic decision-making that leads to the complex
alliance building that results in inequality. This same model demonstrates the dynamism in
careers as men compete for social status. I conclude with implications for drawing
inferences on social complexity from the archaeological record.

[219] A Stone’s Throw Away: Local Sources for Olympic Peninsula Dacites
Within the boundary of Olympic National Park over 95% of flaked stone artifacts have been
visually identified as a single raw material type – dacite. However, uncertainty exists
concerning the provenance of this material. Though no bedrock outcrops have been
located on the Olympic Peninsula, this paper presents complementary lines of evidence
including x-ray florescence assessment, lithic technological assessment, and human land-
use patterns to suggest that the material is likely derived from glacial outwash found in local
river valleys and lowlands. Future research is directed toward pinpointing a local primary
source while strengthening the limited fine-grained volcanic library for x-ray florescence
characterization studies.

[7] Phylogenetic relationship of mid-Holocene canines from California and their relationship
to dog domestication
This poster presents the methods and results of the sequencing 262 base pairs of the
mtDNA hypervariable region of ten prehistoric dogs (Canis [lupus] familiaris) recovered
from California archaeological deposits. These remains span the time period from Early to
Late Holocene, circa. 7000 to 200 years BP. These data on the mitochondrial genome will
help clarify the phylogenetic relationship between North American prehistoric canids and
modern day dogs and wolves. These results will also help assess the significance of
haplotype variability during the early stages of canid domestication in North America.

[143] Landscape Investment among Folsom Foragers of the Rocky Mountains of Western
North America
Folsom landscape organization changed dramatically during the Younger Dryas, known
locally as the Satanta Peak advance in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Regional
reorganization follows hundreds if not thousands of years of colonization efforts by earlier
populations. Folsom sites, while numerous, are hardly uniform in size and structure.
Logistical camps, such as Lindenmeier, were repeatedly reoccupied and used during cold
weather seasons. Their importance suggests an increased need for predictable and
sustainable resources. Stylistic diversity among contemporaneous projectile point types
suggests a complex social landscape. Thus, the period marked a time of mapping of
resource structure, settling in, and intensification.

[79] Animate Versus Inanimate: The Conflict between Mayan and European Astronomical
Traditions in Mayan Colonial Documents
In colonial Mayan documents there is a contradiction in how celestial bodies are counted, in
some cases using the numeral classifier –tul (for human and supernatural beings) and in
others the numeral classifier –p’el (for inanimate beings). In this work it is proposed that
such contradiction is only apparent, reflecting the conflict between two great astronomical
traditions: the original pre-Columbian Maya, who conceived of celestial bodies as animate
beings, and the recently acquired European one, which considered celestial bodies as inert
objects.

[81] Simulated ground-penetrating radar anomalies as a tool for survey planning and data
interpretation
The use of geophysical surveys in archeology is gaining importance; however, results are
often used solely as a mapping tool rather than as a primary line of evidence for
archaeological interpretations. Limitations are due to the inherent complexity of geophysical
datasets. Although rarely used in archeology, computer simulations are omnipresent in
environmental geophysics when interpreting complex subsurface geometries. Synthetic
models are simplified representations of buried features and stratigraphy. These are
subjected to virtual conditions that replicate geophysical survey conditions. Case studies
are used to demonstrate the value of using synthetic models to help archaeological survey
planning and data interpretation.

[33] Modeling Life Expectancy and Surplus Production of Dynamic Pre-contact Territories
in Leeward Kohala, Hawai‘i
Hawaiian territoriality evolved in response to the ecodynamics of changing populations set
within shifting socio-political structures. Modeling agricultural surplus production and life
expectancy of various prehistoric and protohistoric territorial configurations in the leeward
Kohala dryland field system identifies the costs and benefits associated with dynamic
territorial units. The analysis suggests that in the most recent territorial configuration certain
segments of society had enhanced fitness in terms of access to agricultural resources at
the expense of others. While this territorial configuration created differentials in individual
fitness, the overall potential for surplus generation and possible redistribution was
maximized.

[2] Archaic Structures in the Trans-Pecos Region
Although rare in the Trans-Pecos region, Archaic pit structures have been previously
reported at the Keystone Dam near El Paso. Due to their simple construction, structures
such as these have sometimes been interpreted as reflecting short-term occupations (Miller
and Kenmotsu 2004). However, O’Laughlin (1980) reported that the Keystone Dam
structures most likely reflected seasonally sedentary occupations. Excavations at site
41CU660 recovered additional data from a Middle Archaic activity area with a simple brush
structure and a Late Archaic pit structure. The new data are presented here and the
implications regarding Archaic subsistence and settlement patterns are explored.

This study examines a hoard of Anglo-Saxon pewter brooches, rings, and beads found in
Cheapside, London, now in the Museum of London, representing a jeweller's stock. Non-
destructive XRF and SEM-EDS analyses were performed to determine the composition of
the individual items within the hoard, while stereomicroscopy and SEM imaging shows their

pewter material. These analyses allow the objects to be placed within a larger framework of
late Anglo-Saxon material culture and to better understand the development of pewter as a

[291] The Status of Approaches to Archaeological Human Remains in Greece
Much of the history of the study of human skeletal remains in Greece placed an uneven
emphasis on the excavation, curation and analysis of "eminent" skeletons, and the
application of craniometrics to investigate racial histories. Concurrently, research pioneered
by Angel focused on questions of demography and population health. During recent years
research has shifted increasingly towards the a) exploration of archaeologically or
historically based research questions, b) use of standardised recording systems c)
application of current techniques (eg stable isotope analysis, aDNA, SEM), and d) the
integration of concepts rooted in archaeological theory and the Osteological Paradox to
interpretation.

[137] Agent-based simulation of hunter-gatherer - farmer interaction in the spread of
farming
This paper discusses the use of agent-based simulation to study hunter-gatherer - farmer
interaction in the spread of farming during the European Neolithic. Whereas researchers
have traditionally tended to assume either rapid replacement of hunter-gatherers by
farmers or indigenous development, a significant benefit of an agent-based approach is
that it allows the nature of the interaction to emerge as the simulation is run.

[75] Accounting for Taphonomic Processes in the Interpretation of Archaeological Faunal
Assemblages: An Example from Xujiayao
Taphonomic processes – in particular, the preferential destruction of certain types of bones
by both humans and natural agents – represent an obstacle to the efforts of
zooarchaeologists to reconstruct the nature of prehistoric hunting strategies. Bone density
is an important predictor of the ability of skeletal elements to resist such processes.
Accurate bone density values have helped to shape our analytical methodology in
quantifying archaeological faunal remains. Bone density values for equids derived by
computed tomography show a high correlation with the long bone representation of equids
from the site of Xujiayao in the western Nihewan basin.

upland Mesolithic sites along the Pennines. In total, six geological sources have been
sampled and analysed, along with black chert artefacts from two upland Pennine
archaeological sites. The results demonstrate that the sources can be differentiated from
one another, revealing the potential of this approach for a larger scale project.

[276] Gender, diet, and mobility at Catalhoyuk: health and lifestyle in the Anatolian Neolithic
At its peak, Çatalhöyük was the home of some 3500 to 8000 people. Study of the skeletal
remains (n=304) reveals differences between men and women in health and physical
activity. Dominance of relatively short stature for both males and females suggests
suboptimal nutrition. However, the higher prevalence of dental caries in females and
greater skeletal robusticity in males reveals important sex differences in diet and lifestyle.
These differences provide new perspective on how these Neolithic farmers navigated a
complex landscape in their acquisition and consumption of food resources and explain the
relative success of this long-term settlement.

This presentation examines patterns of interaction of Recuay tradition groups, comparing
research at a village (Chinchawas) and a large regional center (Yayno). Two types of
coast-highland interaction are discussed: trade and stylistic. Whereas stylistic interaction
was most prevalent during early periods, trade interaction with the coast became more
prominent later. Wari expansion helped to open up coast-highland networks in the Callejón
de Huaylas, but not in the eastern highlands. Also, settlement size or economic power
appear less important for the intensity/type of long-distance interaction than location and
local cultural prerogatives (cults, traditions in making, use contexts).

problems distinguishing cultigen from the wild. Soybean-bearing sites are in the regions
where wild soybean is distributed and that have a long history of agriculture and social
complexity. This paper integrates interdisciplinary evidence to provide a more holistic

[35] Testing the assumption of faunal migration in the hunter-gatherer seasonal mobility
model of Mediterranean Europe
We address animal mobility, a key assumption of the hunter-gatherer seasonal mobility
model in the European Upper Paleolithic, using a combination of oxygen, carbon and
strontium isotopes, as a prelude to addressing human mobility. Sequential isotope profiles
for teeth of Equus hydruntinus and Cervus elaphus from four archaeological sites located
on the central Italian coast and uplands show that seasonal changes dominate 18O/16O
profiles. Evidence for high elevation exists in some teeth, but altitudinal changes are not
apparent, although there are challenges to establishing this from 18O/16O. Our data also
suggest that the ranging behaviors of the two taxa differed.

[202] Bedrock Mortar Morphology and Placement in the Sierra Nevada
Bedrock mortars, one of the most ubiquitous cultural features of the Sierra Nevada, vary in
their morphology dependent on their function. Utilized mainly for processing acorns,
bedrock mortars in this region have the potential to be prime indicators of prehistoric
behavior, particularly of settlement patterns and decision making. Using quantitative
analysis, GIS modeling, and the ethnographic record, this study attempts to address these
aspects of behavior from data collected from hundreds of bedrock mortar sites from the
central Sierra.

[165] Recent Research at Kerkenes Dað
Recent research at Kerkenes Dag, the site of a major Iron Age urban center in Central
Anatolia, consisted of three main efforts. The combined results of a remote sensing survey
of the Palatial Complex and environs further clarified the characterization and organization
of internal structures, possible architectural phasing and the relationship to adjacent
compounds outside of the complex walls. A new technique for testing pedestrian simulation
models was further tested by excavating and sampling street sections. A detailed/multi-
faceted analysis of metals began in order to elucidate the heretofore unknown metal
acquisition networks and economy during the Central Anatolian Iron Age.

[14] Neighborhoods in Classic Lowland Maya Societies: Identification and Definition
In Classic Lowland Maya settlement pattern archaeology there is a very recent interest in
intermediate residential units, due to new ethnohistoric, epigraphic and archaeological data
bearing on elites competing for the power with kingly dynasties. Their residences dispersed
all over the residential zone among commoner settlements, would have represented a
barrio focus (Ashmore 1988). But these neighborhoods, not easily defined morphologically,
pose a methodological issue: how can we identify them archaeologically? This paper will
attempt to answer this question by studying the La Joyanca settlement pattern compared to
Cobá and Copán.

[52] Community-Level Interaction at Sxwoxwiymelh
Sxwoxwiymelh (the Katz site) is the largest pithouse settlement in the upper Fraser Valley,
composed of 39 houses. We analyze artifacts, household size, and village layout to
document community interaction 2500-2000 BP. The data indicate an initial, slow
development of the community, followed by rapid growth ~2200 BP. Most houses fall within
a narrow size range, with one or two distinctly larger ones. The artifacts suggest that all
households are involved in the same economic tasks, including the domestic production of
nephrite celts. These data indicate a cohesive social unit, with perhaps only marginal social
and economic differences among households.

[139] Dental Caries in a Mesolithic Shell Midden: Ideas on Subsistence and Society
The fragmentary collection from the Mesolithic shell midden of Cova da Onça, Portugal,
yielded 195 teeth. Breccia obscured tooth surfaces limiting observation to visual and dental
probe inspection. Caries were most prevalent in posterior teeth, with the occlusal surface
most commonly affected. Caries prevalence by tooth type is 18.72% which is considerably
higher than would be expected for a foraging population, but comparable to Muge Valley
samples. Caries prevalence and distribution can be suggestive of subsistence patterns,
which are integral to understanding cultural context. No inferences about differential access
to resources were drawn since sex and age determinations were impossible.

[52] Interaction, Identity, and Fraser Valley Archaeology
For millennia, the Fraser River and its tributaries has encouraged and enabled intense
interaction among communities living along its length. Such intense interaction has resulted
in both the formation of distinct identities and of social alliances. Our research over the past
decade on ancient settlements of the upper Fraser Valley has provided insights into the
nature of this interaction both among and within communities. This poster summarizes
some of the background and grand results from this research and provides context for the

[189] Raw Material Variability and Reduction Trajectories in the Late Archaic of New
Mexico
Use-wear accrual should be viewed as a small-scale form of reduction. Use-wear analysis,
therefore, can be approached from a chaines operatoire perspective. Experimental and
archaeological analyses by the author have shown that differences in rates of use-related
wear accrual attributable to both the use of different raw materials and the working of
different contact materials can be quantified in a systematic manner using digital imaging
and GIS. This paper reports on the progress of continued research to further refine these
methods as a means of clarifying the nature of use-related reduction trajectories. It builds
on prior work by adopting both macro- and microscopic approaches to enhance our ability
to assess tool function and the nature of use-related reduction processes.

museums within this debate? Prior to the arrival of J. A. Sabloff to Penn, Penn Museum
stopped the acquisition of material with a questionable or unknown provenience. Sabloff’s
tenure at Penn re-enforced this approach. And new relations between universities,

[58] Competition and Cooperation in the Formative Lake Titicaca Basin: New Insights from
Taraco, Peru
Recent research at Taraco has exposed a sequence of construction periods and land use
shifts from at least 1300 BC. Excavation data suggest that Taraco was the major regional
center during the late Qaluyu and early Pukara periods. Significant finds include the
contemporaneity of Pukara and Qaluyu fineware, and a site-wide burning episode that
marks the end of Taraco as an economic center. These data suggest that Taraco was a
competitor with the site of Pukara, and that cooperation and competition were defining
characteristics of increasing social complexity in the northern Basin during the early Late
Formative Period.

[60] Holocene Sea Level and Environmental Change in Central Puget Sound, Washington:
Implications for Settlement Pattern Models
Local sea level curves for Central Puget Sound provide estimates of probable marine
shoreline positions throughout the Holocene. The Early and Middle Holocene marine littoral
was less extensive and had less environmental diversity than Late Holocene marine
shorelines. Changes in climate and vegetation regimes, shoreline position, and seismic
activity affected resource distribution and productivity throughout the Holocene. Extant
archaeological and environmental data are used to estimate probable settlement types and
locations through time. Many Early and Middle Holocene marine littoral settlements were
inundated or eroded, and are underrepresented in the archaeological database.
Implications for subsistence-settlement pattern models are discussed.

[19] The Production of Mounded Landscapes by Hunter-Gatherers: A Perspective from San
Francisco Bay, California
There is growing recognition among North American archaeologists that hunter-gatherers
produced mounded landscapes. This is particularly true for coastal hunter-gatherers who
sometimes produced extensive shell mounds. Most traditional interpretations of these
coastal sites privilege explanations grounded on specific kinds of subsistence and refuse
dumping practices. More recent studies are now examining various social and political
factors that contributed significantly to the regional distribution and spatial layout of
mounded sites. This paper examines these issues by presenting a case study from an on-
going study in the greater San Francisco Bay Area.

[153] Societies Against the State, or The Failure of the State in Iberian Prehistory
The debate regarding the emergence of the State has galvanized archaeological research
in the Iberian Peninsula. However, this debate also tends to mask the full range of social
formations that existed prior to Roman conquest. From the vantage point of western Iberia,
specifically Portugal, a spectrum of social formations characterized the Neolithic through
the Bronze Age. A diachronic view of settlement patterns, exchange systems, and mortuary
complexes in western Iberia suggests that human populations regularly resisted material
expressions of power. This paper reviews this evidence and explores some factors that
contributed to the failure of the State in Iberian prehistory.

[96] Beginnings of Metallurgy in Ancient East Asia: Who, When, and Where?
Metallurgy has been taken as essential to the development of Chinese civilization.
Archaeological study has been particularistic and evolutionary, tied to traditional Chinese
historiography, and modern Marxist model of social development. Modern studies suggest
that it emerged independently in a "core" area and then spread to "peripheral" areas by
way of political expansion and cultural diffusion over many millennia, and that metallurgy
was also homegrown. New excavations suggest: multiple early centers of production; that
the Chinese case belongs to a regional context; that native sources of ores were
significant; that metals were used in several pre-state level societies.

[16] Toward Understanding Commoners through Wealth Fetishism, Materiality, Labor, and
Alienation
Notions of impartable and inalienable wealth strongly influence how archaeologists
understand the internal ordering of societies. Focus on wealth as the materialization of
value, coupled with restricted access or displays of specialized skill or knowledge, often
approaches a fetishism that actually masks many of the processes through which social
identities were crafted, alliances forged, and hierarchies established or defeated.
Centralizing the labor dimension of wealth, alongside materiality, reopens these processes
for examination, and leads to a fuller understanding of processes of alienation. Moreover, it
brings to light the contributions of both commoners and non-commoners as participants in
ongoing social reconstitution.

[313] Why We Do Not Want to Close Morphometric Space in Classifying Artifacts
Biological models, often applied in normative archaeological classification, assume
concordance on nomenclature, complete knowledge, and defined hierarchical relationships
that are difficult to defend in practical archaeological research. Fuzzy logic better
represents pragmatic archaeological research goals and priorities. Fuzzy truths allow
approximations in vaguely defined sets. If we impose accepted classifications on our data
we risk failing to refine our analytical systems, and we may not recognize significant
variation that requires new models for adequate interpretation. This paper presents an AI
system for classifying stone projectile point types that is extensible and learns as new data
are added.

[278] Exploring Habitat Preference on Idaho's Snake River Plain: An Ideal Free Distribution
Model of Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene Land Use
Human land use decisions on Idaho’s Snake River Plain during the terminal
Pleistocene/early Holocene are explored using a population ecology model known as the
Ideal Free Distribution. Paleoenvironmental data are used to rank three regionally available
habitats according to their relative resource richness and predictability. The study area’s
pluvial lake complex is given primary ranking; river corridors and sagebrush steppe are
given secondary and tertiary rankings, respectively. Fluted point distributions, including Owl
Cave specimens, indicate that Clovis groups did not tether to pluvial lakes as predicted,
instead favoring river corridors, while Folsom/Midland distributions demonstrated no
statistical habitat preference.

[237] Inca Appropriation of Sacred Shrines in the Lake Titicaca Basin: Preliminary Results
of an Archaeological Survey of the Copacabana Peninsula, Bolivia
The economic, political, and ideological motivations for the incorporation of the Lake
Titicaca region into the Inca Empire have been the focus of several archaeological studies.
The stimulus of ideology is particularly complex since the Inca domination of sacred places
such as Pachacamac, Tiwanaku, and Copacabana, also served political ends of
legitimizing sovereignty and control over other Andean societies. The Inca materialized
their cosmology and mythic history through the appropriation and transformation of these
important, pan-Andean sacred places. This paper will discuss the varied ways in which the
Inca modified preexisting shrines, and thus re-altered the landscape of the Copacabana
Peninsula, Bolivia.

[142] Late Holocene Fish Traps in the Transforming Landscapes of Willapa Bay,
Washington
Intertidal fish traps are now widely investigated on the Northwest Coast. Most fish trap
research focuses on identifying prehistoric traps, and interpretations tend to focus on trap
construction and function. In this presentation, I emphasize instead the changing nature of
fish trap use during the late prehistoric and early historic periods on Willapa Bay,
Washington. Traps are envisioned here as being consciously employed to do more than
just catch fish. I argue that the placement of both historic and prehistoric traps relates in
part to issues of territory, routes of travel, shifting demographics, and altered settlement
patterns.

[146] L'Exclusif? : European Colonial Wares From French Guyana (1652-1789)
During the French Guyanese Old Colonial Regime, the Metropole enforced mercantilism,
which designated itself as the exclusive trade partner for the exchange of goods with the
colony. However, the historical data show that this mercantile principle was not always
complied with in French colonial settlements; in Guyana as well as in the rest of the
Caribbean area. The European wares found on several sites of French Guyana allow us to
untangle the relative importance of commercial protectionism mandated by the Metropole
and the illicit contributions of other European powers in the French Guyanese trade
network.

[249] Climate Change and Human Adaptation in the Bonneville Basin: The Blue Lake
Pollen Record and Archaeology of Bonneville Estates Rockshelter
The latest Pleistocene and early Holocene in the Great Basin were periods of significant
climate change and landscape evolution. From 11,000-5000 B.P. wetlands expanded and
contracted, vegetation compositions and distributions changed, and range shifts and local
extinctions in fauna occurred. For humans, these climate-driven environmental changes
significantly impacted resource structure and availability. In this paper we present new data
of vegetation change obtained from the Blue Lake pollen record, and evidence of human
technological, subsistence, and settlement change from Bonneville Estates Rockshelter, to
show how climate change ultimately induced evolution of human land use strategies in an

El Mesón emerged as a secondary center to the large EpiOlmec site Tres Zapotes during
the Late Formative period (BC 400-1 AD). Despite the decline of the larger center, growth
in the El Mesón area continued into the Early Classic period (1 – 600 AD). In this paper I
examine the relationship of economic production and exchange to the political organization
of the El Mesón area. Specifically, I consider how the political economy of the area
changed with the decline of Tres Zapotes, and whether new opportunities became
available that allowed the El Mesón area to prosper into the Classic period.

[155] Identity, style, and household ritual at La Blanca, Guatemala
Multiple sources of identity exist in all societies and the choices made by individuals and
groups about how to construct identity are fluid and situational. Overlapping categories of
style in Middle Preclassic domestic assemblages may reflect the complex practices that
went into the construction of identity. People at La Blanca drew upon pan-Mesoamerican
symbols, regional styles, local elements, and idiosyncratic forms in the making and use of
material culture. Forms of material culture style probably used in household ritual reflect the
participation of local people in many different types of group identity, as well as the
construction of individual identities.

Late Aztec period chinampa production of Lake Chalco and Xochimilco has been credited

[76] Authority and power at the DGB sites, northern Cameroon
The DGB sites of northern Cameroon provide ambiguous messages about power and
authority. The restricted distribution and small size of many of these sites would necessitate
only minimal access to resources, and the sites probably display features associated with
the authority today held by ritual experts who control rainfall. At the same time, the DGB-1/-
2 site complex is much larger, and construction was contemporary with first contacts
between the region and the Kanuri state to the north. Considerations of political power,
especially through contacts with centralised polities, must be kept in mind as we interpret
the DGB phenomenon.

[31] Building Landscapes and Technologies: Ethnoarchaeology in the Mouth of the Amazon
River
Located on the mouth of the Amazon river Caviana Island conforms a landscape mosaic of
forest-covered elevated areas and low natural fields. Ethnohistorical documentation and
previous archaeological works realized in this area lead to the implementation of an
ethnoarchaeological research within the riverine communities of the island. The occupation
dynamic in a long term perspective will be addressed in this paper focusing on the
processes of continuity and change in the management of the landscape and production
and reproduction of technological systems within riverine communities and the indigenous
groups that occupied the region in pre-colonial past.

[260] The Artifice of Dene Travel Technologies
Travel is central to the identities of Athapaskan (Dene) peoples living in the Northwest
Territories. In the context of community-based archaeological projects, we have
documented the material culture of travel technologies, and, traveling through the
landscape with Dene elders, have also gained an understanding of the cultural principles
for traveling in a sacred landscape. Drawing on Robin Ridington's distinction between
'artifact' and 'artifice', we discuss the social and cultural dimensions of Dene travel
technologies, which, we argue, are important factors for understanding how artifacts were
used in the context of a cultural landscape.

[275] Early Holocene technological transitions at the multicomponent Richardson Island
archaeological site, Haida Gwaii, B.C
The Richardson Island site contains cultural material dating between 9300 and 5000
14CBP (10,500 to 5700 calBP). The earliest component, the Kinggi Complex, includes
bifacial/unifacial toolkits, while the latest component, assigned to the Late Moresby
Tradition, lacks bifaces entirely but contains abundant microblades. Between these, finely-
stratified deposits record the addition of microblade technology around 8750 14CBP (9750
calBP), resulting in several hundred years of a mixed bifacial/microblade component: the
Early Moresby Tradition. This transition is examined with reference to typology, raw
material, and environmental change, as well as broader spatial and temporal trends across
the northern Pacific.

Over the past ten years, investigations of the relict agricultural terracing found in the hilly
terrain surrounding Minanha have been multi-faceted. While work is on-going and

terrace construction and use. The spatial proximity of the densest concentrations of
terracing and associated settlement remains to the site core, as well as the coincidence of
the rise and fall of Minanha’s royal court with the widespread adoption and eventual
abandonment of terrace farming, suggests strong linkages between this form of intensive

suggests that accounts of mythological events may have had a significance unrelated to
Western concepts of a prime-mover who creates the universe from nothing. Many so-called
creation stories are metaphorical explanations of natural phenomena, some referring to

of a cyclical organization of time, reflecting a focus on repeating and predictable cosmic
events.

Flaked stone reduction is often dichotomized as either “formal” or “expedient.” Expediency
refers to reduction of stone for imminent, short-term use without appreciable concern for
tool elaboration or conservation of stone. Within this general strategy there remains wide
scope for variability in application. Samples from Viejo period and Medio period
assemblages collected in central Chihuahua are compared using a standardized analysis
to identify intersite consistency and variability. Differences in reduction intensity and tool
design exist, reflecting the flexibility of expedient reduction. Possible reasons for observed

Mission bells were the symbolic cornerstone of Spanish control over native populations in
the Americas. It is our belief that many of the bell fragments recovered at Mission Santa
Catalina are a result of the Guale Uprising of 1597 during which it is theorized the first
occupation of the mission was destroyed. To test our theory we combined the spatial
analysis of the fragments recovered within the mission complex with elemental data
gathered using portable x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy. A comparative collection of
mission bell fragments from the American Southwest was also analyzed in this study.

[303] Tracing Traditions through Time: New Insights into the Epipalaeolithic of the Southern
Levant
Current explanations for the origins of sedentism and social complexity in the Near East
focus on the sudden appearance of villages, architecture, intensified plant and animal use,
a flourishing of art and elaborate personal decoration, and mortuary traditions including
burial of the dead in formal cemeteries during the Early Natufian. Climatic and other
conditions provide the impetuses and the resulting societal shifts are often considered
necessary pre-cursors for farming and village life. But, do these pre-conditions really occur
suddenly in the Natufian? New and old data from sites Jordan now forces us to re-examine
these old paradigms, particularly the evidence for sedentism, technological change, and
mortuary practices, and demonstrates a deeper time depth for many of the features thought
to emerge abruptly during the Natufian.

[309] Store, Save, Accumulate, Keep and Remember: Exploring the Many Dimensions of
Food Storage in Late Bronze Age Northern Greece
The paper focuses on food storage; a neglected topic in archaeological research. Storage
is considered still within frameworks that stress the determining role of “subsistence
needs”, and is viewed as material evidence for inequality (via surplus). I propose that
storage needs to be considered within a framework that stresses social interaction,
historicity, and agency. I consider old and new pertinent evidence from LBA Northern
Greece. It becomes possible to identify multiple dimensions of storage and to explore how
these might have been implicated in the complex power relations within and among local
communities at the end of the Bronze Age.

[18] Building Heritage Consciousness: Cultural Resource Managers, the Public, and
Aboriginal Communities in British Columbia
Aboriginal communities wishing to preserve and control their cultural heritage face
considerable challenges. Such challenges include implementation of heritage protection
policies, capacity building, consultation, heritage research education, and the resolution of
land claims. Furthermore, the Canadian public remains unaware of the importance of
preserving heritage. Cultural resource managers are in an advantageous position to inform
public education, consult with Aboriginal Communities, and contribute to capacity building,
yet there appears to be an absence of their participation in the resolution of these important
matters. I explore issues fundamental to developing a public consciousness towards the
protection of ancient cultural heritage.

[11] Is Costly Signaling Costly?
Previous studies have argued that signaling is costly because one never sees returns
consummate with the expense of the signal. On average, this may be the case. But for
those for whom the signal works, the costs may be less than the return on investment.
Using game theory, we model the effects of costly signaling on those individuals who have
a substantial return on their investment. Using the organizers of successful feasts and wars
as examples, we show that the overall costs of signaling may be much smaller than the
long-term return for the individual and his kin group.

diachronic changes in human niche breadth. Changes in species abundance data from six

Electron and laser probe microchemical analyses were performed on Hopewell meteoritic
iron necklace beads from Havana, Illinois and their suggested source, an iron meteorite
found near Anoka, Minnesota, to evaluate the Havana-Anoka provenance relationship.
Laboratory and experimental simulations were performed to discern manufacturing
techniques. Results show significant microchemical similarities between the Havana bead

heating. The Anoka iron was likely traded by local people to a region knowledgeable in
metal working technology where the iron was made into beads and finally traded to Havana

[148] A Historical Ecology of the Calusa of Southwest Florida
Our work is guided by historical ecology, the interdisciplinary, empirical, and holistic study
of human societies in their dynamic environmental contexts. Environmental archaeological
findings demonstrate that longer-term (100-300 year) sea-level fluctuations and shorter-
term storm episodes (e.g., hurricanes) stimulated specific socio-cultural responses.
Competing models emphasize only one "sea-level transgression," ca. 750 B.C., which led
to population growth and ultimately a complex Calusa chiefdom. Adopting a more nuanced
approach, I assert that multiple climatic fluctuations helped stimulate an episodic,
punctuated cultural trajectory, and that some of the trappings of complexity observed
historically (hierarchy, tribute, warfare) were late responses to European influences.

The Late Bronze Age (LBA) archaeology of the South Caucasus has been dominated since
the 19th century by the excavation and analysis of burial data. Traditional interpretations
have used burial materials to trace chronological and periodizational distinctions, largely
disregarding the potential for burial practices to shed light on social dynamics. Particularly
representative of this analytical model are the 640 catacomb tombs excavated in the Artik

objects, and burial construction methods, we examine how the social relationships of the

A survey of healed cranial depression fractures from Ancestral Pueblo groups across time

head wounds by age and sex. These data provided two distinct avenues of questioning; (1)
What were the victim’s long-term behavioral sequelae based on the relationship between
point of impact and traumatic brain injury? (2) Does the patterning infer information on the
perpetrators of this kind of non-lethal violence? Results suggest that individuals with head
wounds had high recidivism rates (they were attacked repeatedly and suffered from
neurological disorders). Head wounds across time are highly varied, but patterning within

[101] Late Holocene Forager adaptations to an arid Pampean-Patagonian transitional
region of Argentina
The Colorado River lower basin is an arid-semi-arid region crossed by an important
aloctone watercourse and it is an ecotone defined by different vegetation communities and
by the fringe effect between the interior and the Atlantic coast. Even though subsistence is
mainly based on artiodactyls (guanaco), the environmental distinctiveness of the area
allows for a more diverse range of prey exploitation and flexible behavioral responses, as
opposed to a consistent specialization. This paper discusses subsistence, lithic technology
and settlement systems in order to illustrate the adaptive and cultural traits of foragers in
this area during the late Holocene.

Then, modern Native American maize of four morphologically distinct ear groups, grown in

kernel traits to also clearly distinguish the four groups. Controlled burning experiments then
re-tested the usefulness of these traits for archaeological specimens.

[185] Production and Exchange in the Casas Grandes Region: A View from the East
Investigations to the east of Paquimé offer new information on the nature of production and
exchange in the region. Archaeological evidence from recently excavated sites provides
data that permits us to evaluate some of the existing perspectives on manufacture and
trade. We examine the distribution of various trade items among eastern Casas Grandes
sites and compare the differences and similarities in their occurrence with reference to
Paquimé. Our research indicates that individual patterns in the distribution of exchange
commodities present a different picture of the Casas Grandes economy than results from
looking only at Paquimé.

[9] Bison, Blisters, and the “Teachable Moment:” Experiment and Experience in
Archaeological Training
During the summer of 2007, 25 undergraduates took part in a participatory field exercise,
butchering a bison using stone tools as a component of a larger lesson plan on prehistoric
Native American use of bison, modern bison ecology and management, and stone tool
technologies. Drawing on a tradition of field training and experimentation in American
archaeology, this project highlights the role of experiential knowledge in the learning
process. We argue that classroom-based and field-based instruction are complimentary,
and that field experience, with it’s wealth of “teachable moments,” must be preserved as a
component of an integrated, interdisciplinary education in anthropology.

During the field seasons of 2006 & 2007 we studied the geomorphic features associated
with the Mississippian Period occupation at Winterville Mounds, which is located in the
Mississippi Alluvial Valley, in northwest Mississippi. Here we present our main findings
regarding landscape reconstruction during occupation, characterization of archaeological
strata and features through physical and chemical analysis, and also micromorphology, and
the results of coring a minor mound at Winterville. These efforts are part of a multi-year

[184] Geoarchaeological Context of Paleoindian Sites in Middle Park, Colorado
Geoarchaeological investigations in Middle Park, Colorado, have produced important
information regarding the soil-stratigraphic context of Paleoindian sites. Early and Late
Paleoindian components in upland settings occur in a buried soil formed over thin, fine-
grained eolian and slopewash deposits. The soil is an important pedostratigraphic marker,
reflecting an episode of landscape stability between ca. 9000-5000 14C yr BP. Soil
morphological properties indicate expansion of forest and grass cover in areas currently
supporting sagebrush steppe, comparing well with regional paleoenvironmental records
that suggest expansion of upper and lower tree lines in response to warmer and probably
wetter early to middle Holocene conditions.

[74] The Adhesive and Repair Material on Lord Pakal’s Funerary Mask: some broader
implications
Lord Pakal, ruler of Palenque from 615 to 683 CE, is perhaps best known through his
magnificent greenstone mosaic funerary mask. The adhesive used to glue the greenstones
to their backing on this mask has been analyzed by GC/MS, revealing copal as the
adhesive. The same technique has revealed that beeswax was used in a repair to the
mask. This paper presents these data, and further explores the use of copal and beeswax
on other ancient Mesoamerican objects, their inherent qualities as adhesives, their
availability, and the production processes behind their use in the manufacture of mosaic
objects.

[282] The Maya Cultural Heritage Initiative and Grassroots Education Efforts
Archaeologists have made tremendous strides towards revealing and interpreting Maya
cultural heritage but little has been shared with descendant communities within Honduras,
Guatemala, Belize, and southern México. Local communities struggle further with under-

Maya Area Cultural Heritage Initiative seeks to redress this situation through grass-roots

presented by Maya educators in local languages whenever possible. One of the goals of
this initiative is to strengthen links between stakeholders and the past and to increase the
perceived value of archaeological heritage.

[149] Implications of Variability in the African Acheulian and Middle Stone Age
The division of African prehistory into Earlier, Middle, and Later Stone Ages has had
heuristic utility, but now impedes our understanding of the past. The Middle Stone Age and
the Acheulian portion of the Earlier Stone Age in particular are assumed to be
technologically uniform through space and time. In fact these supposedly static entities
exhibit internal variability that sometimes exceeds the differences between them. It is
recommended that future research focus upon this variability and the environmental,
temporal, and behavioral differences that it represents.

will present ethnohistorical expectations and archaeological inferences to suggest that,

[138] Shields of Clay: The Symbolism of Spindle Whorls from Postclassic Cholula
This case study considers decorative imagery found on fired-clay spindle whorls from
Postclassic Cholula as an iconographic system relating to female discourse. The images
are related to symbolism associated with the deity complex in pre-Columbian and early
Colonial pictorial manuscripts. We conclude that the symbolic system used on spindle
whorls and other aspects of female practice created a communication network shared by
Postclassic women, and may therefore record arenas of social conflict not recorded in
ethnohistorical sources.

[19] Visualizing Ancient Social Networks in the Eastern Subarctic
Thirty years of cultural resource management projects in northern Québec have produced a
rich data set that challenges deeply help assumptions about subarctic hunter-gatherers.
Clearly, options were constrained in this ambiguous environment, where groups and
individuals needed to be both adapted and adaptable in order to survive. Nevertheless,
changing patterns of lithic use over 4000 years suggest the importance of social and
ideological factors in group mobility and interaction. Concepts and modeling tools borrowed
from the scientific study of complex adaptive systems offer new ways to think about the
past and a more nuanced understanding of eastern subarctic life.

[238] A Wide View of Hominid Faunal Exploitation Strategies: Comparative Perspectives on
the Early and Middle Pleistocene
Modern archaeological studies have focused on the explanation of variability in
assemblage characteristics over space in time. Contrary to this approach, many highly
important inferences about early hominid faunal exploitation have rested upon the evidence
from a single set of localities—Olduvai—and, more specifically, a single site—FLK “Zinj.”
This paper examines a wide selection of Early and Middle Pleistocene faunal assemblages.
It finds the ubiquitous influence of taphonomic variables, especially density-mediated
attrition. Despite this, the paper also recognizes significant variation stemming from
differences in hominid behavior, including adaptation to latitudinal conditions and temporal
trends across the Pleistocene.

[20] Southwestern Bioarchaeology in the Context of Repatriation: Standards, Qualifications,
and Sharing Data
In the Southwest, the implementation of repatriation legislation has limited osteological
observations to nondestructive analysis, restricted the time available for observation, and
generally prevented reexamination of remains because of prompt reburial. At the same
time, it has increased reporting of burial discoveries, raised the minimum level of
osteological documentation required, and increased interaction between bioarchaeologists
and descendant groups. Establishing higher standards and qualifications for osteological
data recovery is essential to enable synthetic bioarchaeological research which can
address larger archaeological research questions rather than being relegated to an
osteological appendix.

interred under the features of Mound Unit 1. Mound Unit 2 consisted of two stone box
tombs each containing an extended burial. Mound Unit 3 had an extended burial laid on the

Mound changed through time. This paper explores those changes.

earliest evidence of this behavior may exist in the fossil record in the form of hominin
modified bone and may be present even in the absence of stone tools. It is possible that if
this evidence exists, it involves tool typologies and bone modification patterns specific to

of this novel new and evolving behavior may require investigation based upon an entirely

chosen in relation to achieving maximum agricultural output; in the second, farmers initially
selected low-risk, low-effort areas and later moved to locations that would require a greater
labor investment for farming. In Wailau, production output was a major consideration in
initial field construction and large amounts of effort were invested in fields that could
produce high yields.

[300] The Power of Shoshone-Bannock Intangible Properties
Many Native American tribes believe that intangible knowledge can only be owned by one

of their power. As many native intangible properties (i.e. photographs, songs,
anthropological field notes) are currently in the possession of non-native groups, the
Shoshone-Bannock Tribes are concerned about their heritage. Therefore, they want federal
legislation that addresses the possibility of interpreting or revising the Native American
Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) to allow for the repatriation of intangible
knowledge. The research, however, does not support this potentiality.

Influence on the Development of Acorn-Intensive Economies
Central California estuaries reached maximal levels of productivity during the Middle
Holocene at the same time that interior California and the Great Basin faced resource
stress. Archaeological data indicate human populations reached relatively high densities at
estuaries during this interval, and show the earliest evidence for intensive mortar and pestle
use in the state. While the estuaries provided an abundance of protein-rich resources, it
became necessary to intensity the production of carbohydrates to take full advantage of
this expanding source of marine food. This relationship may signal the origin of the acorn-

Archaeological data from 23 sites in the Pampa Colorada demonstrate three key settlement
transitions from the Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene to the end of the Middle Holocene
and a shift from intensive specialized fishing and foraging to diverse marine-based
subsistence strategies. This pattern is consistent with Jaguay and Machas Phase culture,
as represented in the Quebrada Jaguay region, though more variability in land and
resource use is apparent in the Pampa Colorada sample. Comparison of the study areas
suggests that dynamic economic strategies were directly related to changes in shoreline

[240] Ancient Maya Canoe Navigation and its Implications for Classic to Postclassic Maya
Economy and Trade: A View From the South Coast of Belize
Ancient Maya economy and sea trade are evaluated with data from the Classic to
Postclassic trading port of Wild Cane Cay and the nearby Late Classic salt works, now
underwater. Wild Cane Cay brokered goods and resources from near and far, including
jadeite, copper, gold, pottery, obsidian, and marine resources, among others. The
discovery of a Late Classic wooden canoe paddle at the K'ak' Naab' salt works provides a
tangible record of ancient Maya canoe navigation. The massive salt industry developed to
meet inland salt needs and collapsed with the abandonment of the inland cities.

[225] Bear Ceremonialism and Pleistocene/Holocene Transition Cave Archaeology from
Haida Gwaii, Coastal British Columbia
The co-occurrence of bear and archaeological remains in cave and non-cave sites reveal
that significant human and bear interaction occurred on the islands of Haida Gwaii at the
Pleistocene/Holocene transition. In this paper, patterns of archaeological materials and
bear remains revealed during recent archaeological investigations are considered in
relation to aspects of bear ceremonialism, ethnographically recorded as being practiced
pan-boreally in northern North America, Asia, and Europe. It is argued that at least the
seeds of bear ceremonialism were in place in the early archaeological record of the
Northwest Coast.

[295] The Antiquity and Diversity of Archaeological Settlement Patterns on Valdes Island
This paper presents a series of over 30 radiocarbon dates obtained from a range of
archaeological sites on Valdes Island in the southern Gulf Islands, British Columbia. These
dates indicate that the frequency of site types and their positioning within this island
environment shifted substantially in the Middle Pacific Period, or Marpole Phase (2400-
1400/1100BP, reflecting an overall intensification of habitation and diversification of
resource acquisition. This local pattern is hypothesized to reflect contemporary changes in
socio-political and economic priorities in regional settlement and subsistence activities in
the Gulf of Georgia region on the Pacific Northwest Coast.

[227] Mapping Formative Period Sculpture: A Look Across Mesoamerica
The Olmec Cultural Phenomenon that emerged along the Southern Gulf Coast of Mexico
during the Formative period is often recognized by monumental stone sculpture. These
monumental sculptures, through distinct artistic style, express various themes central to
Olmec beliefs and practices. Across Mesoamerica stylistic and iconographic features found
on monumental sculpture demonstrate a resemblance to this artistic style, which provides
insight into the sociopolitical and ideological interaction across these regions through time.
By examining monumental sculpture using geospatial techniques this paper explores the
nature and distribution of these artistic expressions in Formative period Mesoamerica.

houses. Excavation at Huu7ii in Barkley Sound exposed a substantial portion of the floor of
a large rectangular house, last inhabited about 400 years ago. Architectural features are
described, as are problems in reconstructing house form through excavation. The
distribution of artifacts and faunal remains provides insights into the social realm.
Comparisons are made with ethnographic descriptions of later Nuu-chah-nulth houses and

[233] The Fragrance of Elite Identity: Flowers in Maya Temples and Tombs at Copan,

Analysis of microbotanical remains from Copan demonstrates that the Maya filled temples
and tombs with flowers and that certain species were used over at least a two hundred year
period in ritual practice. Flowers, such as Bourreria, may have been utilized to fill the air
within temple precincts with an intense fragrance imbuing such areas with a paradisiacal
feel, and playing an important role in the pageantry which reinforced the rights of the elites
to control the populace. Other plants such as Typha (Cattail) were employed to recall
ancient watery origins, possibly linking this city to Teotihuacan.

Neandertal behavior of the similarities between of these two sequences and other similar
stratified sites in region.

[248] Lithic Scavenging in the Upper Dan River Drainage of North Carolina
The use of older stone tools as raw materials for the production of new ones appears to
have been common in the upper Dan River drainage of North Carolina during the Contact
period. Efforts to begin quantifying the prevalence of this practice during the Late Saratown
phase (A.D. 1670-1710) suggest it may have been a pragmatic response to changing
economic conditions accompanying the spread of European settlers and diseases into the
North Carolina Piedmont. A better understanding of the spatial distribution of scavenged
tools is needed to explore the possibility that lithic scavenging also had social or ritual
significance.

and a GIS (Geographic Information System) to process and present the field data in
spatially meaningful maps. This poster presentation demonstrates some of the analytical

[306] Clovis on the Western Landscape
There remains a paucity of Clovis occupations in the Pacific Northwest. Especially when
viewing the continental site distribution patterns. What can we infer from this patterning?
Data on the distribution of Clovis in the region is reviewed. It is argued that regional
distribution patterns of sites suggest Clovis employed a ranging strategy designed to
explore vast amounts of terrain with few return visits. This implies low population densities
and explains the need for a caching strategy to disperse equipment (insurance caches)
across the landscape. Winter sedentism may be another trademark of this subsistence and
settlement pattern.

[147] The Wari state, ancestors, rural hinterland and agricultural infrastructure
Environmental data from the Chicha valley suggest there were three significant phases of
landscape instability. The 1st after 70 AD, the 2nd just prior to 1220-1330 AD, and the 3rd
after 1720-1890 AD. First terrace construction in the valley dates to the early Middle
Horizon, re-building occurred in the Late Intermediate Period. The introduction of maize
focussed agriculture occurred in the Early Intermediate Period. The archaeological
evidence demonstrates a rapid population increase for Middle Horizon epoch II associated
with the first use of terraced agricultural systems. Management of these developments
appears to be rooted in concepts of ancestor worship.

[291] The Bioarchaeological Approach in Study of Human Skeletal Remains in Russia: Past
and Present
Approaches to archaeological human remains in Russia can be divided into distinct
periods, related to the changing history of the country. Earliest studies date to the late 19th
century. The Soviet period of palaeoanthropological research was mainly concerned with
studies of skull morphology, which discussed problems of origins and the human
colonisation of Eurasia. The current period in Russian investigations of archaeological
remains began about 20 years ago with an interest in palaeoecology of ancient societies.
Studies in palaeodemography and palaeopathology are more common. Current
developments can be characterized as a "return to archaeology" with a renewed emphasis.

trauma in several regions across the southwest. Analysis of macrobotanical and faunal
data will provide indirect evidence of diet and inferred nutritional stress at sites with skeletal
material available. Skeletal data are used to directly evaluate the presence and severity of
disease, trauma, and nutritional stress.

as American Frontier-folk; they arrived with their native ethnicity, for example Irish, French,
German, or even Yankee. How, and to what extent, does an immigrant family make the
transition from their native ethnicity to that of the fabled American Frontier? Does it begin
upon arrival? Are there archaeological markers? The question of ethnic markers at these
sites was considered throughout the research process with some surprising results.

[35] Gradients in caprine ä18O intra-tooth profiles from Neolithic Gritille, Turkey:
Implications for herd management, human mobility and subsistence
Oxygen isotope ratios in tooth enamel have been successfully used to evaluate aspects of
the palaeoenvironmental contexts and habitat preferences of prehistoric mammals, and the
effects of human management of domesticated species. Intra-tooth variation been used to
demonstrate bimodal birth seasons in African prehistoric caprine herds, and potential
resource catchments of early food producing communities. Patterns of intra-tooth variation
in caprines from Neolithic Gritille, southeastern Turkey may indicate differences in species
(i.e. sheep vs. goat), differences in location during the rut, or management of birthing times.
This paper will evaluate these possible explanations and consider implications for human

This paper presents an overview of the dentition recovered from the LA City Cemetery.
Dental remains indicate health status through dental pathology. Compared with other
nineteenth century cemetery populations, the health of this population is relatively good,
and the dental restorations noted suggest the presence of members of a privileged class.
Dental morphology is used to interpret ancestral affiliation of the population, including within
group variation. The patterns of dental morphology reveal the majority of individuals to be
of European descent. The results of this study highlight the important role dentition plays
when analyzing a set of poorly preserved remains.

[257] Elites in the Rio Bec region: producing crops … and great houses as well
All Maya Classic sub-royal elites may not have shared interests with royal elites. Situations
probably existed where elite interactions were intended not so much to enhance the king
power, as to develop strategies in benefit of sub-royal groups. In the Rio Bec region,
archaeological, iconographic and epigraphic data indicate that kingship has been, for most
of the time, weakly articulated while a regional, mainly agrarian elite was present and
active. Serving the strategies of its factions, invention and diffusion of architectural ideas
over a wide region created for them highly visible and prestigious houses.

[105] 9.000 years of earth, wind, fire and stone at Cascade Pass
A stratified record of human occupation, tephra deposition, and soil accretion is revealed
from preliminary test excavations at 45CH221, on an alpine saddle on the Cascade Range
crest. Geochronology spans ca. 9000 cal. years BP, based on seven 14C age estimates on
wood charcoal and on five primary tephra layers sourced to four Cascade Range
volcanoes. Four intact hearths in the sequence variously date between 8,800 and 2,010
cal. years BP. Cultural components reveal pre-3800 BP microblade and flake-core tools
and post-3800 BP resharpening flakes from biface tools. Cascade Pass has yielded the
first well-dated, early Holocene (pre-Mazama) cultural component of Pacific Northwest
indigenous use of high mountain terrain.

[73] Beware of Highlanders: Coast-Highland Interactions in the Virú Valley, Peru
Over the last decade, the study of inter-valley interactions has largely structured research
conducted along the Peruvian north coast, leading archaeologists to study warfare, trade
and cultural life in terms of north-south movements of populations, goods and ideas.
Although coast-highland contacts are usually acknowledged, they rarely are considered to
have shaped local cultural developments. Our work in Virú seems to challenge this view,
however. Surveys reveal that the settlement pattern was designed with coast-highland
interactions in mind, and the results of excavations confirm the key role of east-west
relations for Virú population throughout the first millennium of the present era.

The nature and timing of the appearance of the Swabian Aurignacian is important for
understanding how Modern Humans replaced Neanderthals in Central and Western
Europe. Recent chronostratigraphic studies at the Swabian cave sites of Hohle Fels and

approximately 40,000 cal. BP in a region already depopulated by Neanderthals. Recent
results from a micromorphological study of the transition at these two cave sites frames the
question within a site-formation model. This approach permits analysis of geogenic and

Although Safety Harbor has Mississippian influences, it is not Mississippian in the strictest

agriculture. There was no reason for the well-adapted Weeden Island peoples to change
their lifestyle, so only some Mississippian elements were adopted. These are clearly seen

integrates morphogenetic and molecular data strengthening their value in paleogenetic
research.

see Marks et al. 2001). Recently, I have proposed (Monnier 2006) that overall stone tool
morphology is unimportant for most uses. The exception, I argue, are those tasks for which
a portion of the tool must be dimensionally restricted in order to perforate, or to fit into a
haft. This hypothesis is tested on ethnographic and prehistoric assemblages.

[298] A warm current: El Nino events in the area around Lake Titicaca (Peru/Bolivia) from
A.D. 600 and 1400.
El Nino events have been blamed as the instigating cause for the collapse of the Tiwanaku
society along the shores of Lake Titicaca. But how robust is the data that such claims are
made upon? Do other environmental indicators from around the world agree with this
theory? Through statistical inference of the published data, this paper looks that the
reliability of the proposition that an increase in El Nino events caused the collapse of the
Tiwanaku society.

[277] The Changing Faces of Cerro Portezuelo
Figurine styles ranging from the Preclassic to the Postclassic periods were identified
among the approximately 600 fragments recovered during the excavations at Cerro
Portezuelo in the 1950s. As a result of recent investigations presented in this session, the
figurines can now be associated with ceramics and other artifacts recovered during the
excavations. Re-examination of the figurine collection in light of this new data not only
provides insight into Cerro Portezuelo$E2 and its relationship with Teotihuacann, Tula, and
the Aztec empire throughout its long period of occupation but also enhances our
understanding of figurine chronology in the Basin of Mexico.

[296] Risks and Rewards in Early South American Camelid Pastoralism
South American domesticated camelids (ancestors of today’s llamas and alpacas)
presented a package of biological and behavioral potential different from that provided by
most Old World domesticates. Camelids are not milked, ridden, or harnessed to plow. Low
reproductive rates, harsh weather, and disease must have hampered intensification upon
early herds. Archaeological evidence from Andean sites for the use of meat, wool, transport
capacity, and dung indicates the close relationship between pastoralism, agricultural
production, and social complexity. Diversity between regions and within regions suggests
local levels of pastoral decision-making for Formative periods; data for later periods of
expansive empires are scarce.

[71] Gendered Display: Warfare Iconography in the Rock Art of Northeast Brazil
Warfare and weapon iconography is common in Brazilian rock art. In the Northeastern
states of Bahia, Piauí and Rio Grande do Norte this imagery ranges from dynamic and
brutal group scenes to stoic, elaborately decorated anthropomorphs. In some of the more
sophisticated compositions the weaponry is prominently displayed yet there is no
suggestion of action, a hunt, attack or otherwise. This sort of display iconography is found
in other media elsewhere in prehistoric South America, and is reflected in the living arts of
the Brazilian Indians. Considering the broader cultural landscape, the rock art may have
worked as gendered display.

[289] Applying Archaeology to Agroecological Development in Honduras
In this paper we discuss our work in the Palmarejo Valley of northwest Honduras. We are
investigating the social, ecological, and economic impacts of globalization on prehispanic
and modern agrarian communities. Our goal is to work with local farmers and development
agencies to model sustainable resource management strategies using archaeological
knowledge. In Palmarejo, prehispanic settlement patterns suggest that residences
dispersed along quebradas were organized into resource user groups or “quebrada
communities.” Geoarchaeological and paleoecological data suggest that quebrada
communities may have been one scale at which Palmarejo inhabitants were organized to
effectively manage key ecological features of the landscape.

[22] The Foraging To Farming Sequence at Dadiwan and Implications for the Adoption of
Agriculture
The independent evolution of agriculture is universally preceded by a period of intensive
wild plant gathering, save in North China, where millet agriculture appears to develop
without intensive foraging antecedents. Excavations at the Dadiwan site, Gansu Province,
PRC, reveal a 60,000-year record of occupation spanning the transitions from low level to
intensive foraging, and from foraging to incipient, and finally intensive agriculture. This
sequence indicates that North China's Neolithic is not an anomaly but rather evolved, as
elsewhere, from intensive hunter-gatherer adaptations, characterized at Dadiwan by
miniature toolforms suggesting an intrusive technology aligned with the North China
microlithic.

[68] Material Perspectives on Late Colonial Ethnicity on the Louisiana Frontier: Architecture
and Pottery at the 1786-1816 Coincoin Plantation
Marie-Thérèse Coincoin is a founding figure for Louisiana’s Cane River Creole community.
Of African descent (or birth) and once enslaved, between 1786 and 1816 she ran a
plantation using Louisiana-born, Kissi, and Bakongo slaves. A six-year study has revealed
the remains of her plantation’s residences and landscape features. The African-style
rammed earth architecture contrasts sharply with other facets of material culture derived
predominantly from interaction with nearby Native Americans and Euro-American traders at
Natchitoches. The material remains of Coincoin’s world provide tantalizing clues about how
this ethnically African and Creole plantation operated on the multi-ethnic frontier.

Development in the Belize River Valley
Evidence of preceramic occupations in Western Belize has increased dramatically over the
past few years. A number of Archaic points have been reported from different settings,
suggesting widespread hunter-gatherer adaptations, and new data reveal Late Archaic
horticultural practices similar to those documented elsewhere. Radiocarbon data indicate
that preceramic populations inhabited this region while settled villages were appearing in

[172] Potential Ritual Structures at Keatley Creek on the Canadian Plateau
Hayden (1998; Hayden and Adams 2004) has suggested that some of the peripheral
housepits at the Keatley Creek are not domestic winter residences, but were instead used
for ritual purposes by shamanistic or secret society activities. Two of these late Kamloops
Horizon potential ritual structures were nearly completely excavated by the authors to
further investigate this hypothesis. We suggest that these potential ritual structures are
much more similar to each other than they are to any completely excavated domestic
housepit at the site. These ritual structures are most notably distinguished from domestic
structures by remote occulted locations, evidence for feasting, extremely low artifact and
debitage counts, high quantities of fish bone, and high proportions of extremely rare fauna
artifact types. Ethnographic and artifactual evidence support Hayden’s hypothesis that
these housepits were used as meeting places for organizations approximating secret
societies.

Selection Approach to the Analysis of Community Organization
Operating from a multi-level selection framework, Rapa Nui community organization is
assessed. Communities were possibly congregated in small groups where the full range of
functional activities was conducted by closely related individuals. A higher level of
organizational complexity where large numbers of un-related people cooperate to produce
the full features of the community is also possible. In the latter case, differentiated
functional activities are localized and integrated within single distinguishable communities.
The level of community organization is investigated by documenting redundancy of
functional feature classes across the survey area. Community integration is analyzed by
investigating the distribution of stylistic classes.

Natufian subsistence strategies are marked by the intensive exploitation of animal
resources, in particular gazelle and small game such as tortoise, hare and partridge.
Despite this important underlying similarity, some variation in hunting intensity, the types of
animals hunted and how animals were utilized occurs amongst sites. This presentation
examines the differences in faunal assemblages from four Natufian sites to determine the
cause of this variability. It is concluded that variation in Natufian hunting and processing
strategies are most closely linked to temporal period, but are also caused by differences in

with rock art was increasingly restricted. At the same time, site function diversified, with
petroglyphs and pictographs serving different purposes. I suggest that these changes relate
to the emergence of small groups within each pueblo who had responsibility for specific
religious knowledge or ritual activities.

[84] Wits Cah Ak'al: the First Hybrid Salt/Pottery Production Site in the Maya Lowlands?
The first ever excavation at the site of Wits Cah Ak’al (WCA) in Belize, Central America,
took place in the spring of 2007, yielding abundant evidence for ancient salt production in
the form of briquetage. Surprisingly, the site also produced various circumstantial and direct
lines of evidence that suggest it also was a locale for pottery production, making WCA a
strong candidate for the first hybrid salt/pottery production site to be documented in the
Maya lowlands. I will discuss the results of artifact and scientific (petrography, INAA, XRF,
SEM) analyses designed in order to evaluate this hypothesis.

[176] Death and Destruction: The Role of the Dead in Pylos, Greece.
Analysis of the mortuary data from the vicinity of the Bronze Age Palace of Nestor in
southwestern Greece reveals that the relationship between the dead and the living was
more complex than is generally assumed. A common understanding is that during the rise
and zenith of the palatial society the mortuary system supported the rights of the privileged
palatial elites; when the palatial economy collapsed the role of the mortuary system shifted

significantly. In contrast to this interpretation, my study shows that the most obvious
changes in mortuary activity occurred before the destruction of the palace.

[131] Identity, Violence and the Spanish Conquest at Puruchuco-Huaquerones, Peru
A subsample of unusual burials from Puruchuco-Huaquerones (circa A.D. 1470-1540),
Peru was unearthed in simple textile wrappings, positioned irregularly, and with few
offerings. This treatment is distinct from the majority of other burials, where individuals were
consistently wrapped, seated, and flexed facing the northeast. Because of the presence of
perimortem skeletal trauma likely caused by Spanish weaponry, project members have
hypothesized that these “atypical” burials post-date Spanish Conquest and were associated
with the 1536 siege of Lima. Using dental metric data, we explore population structure and
biological affinities within the cemetery in order to elucidate the identity of these individuals.

[115] The Role of Manmade Stone Holes in Natufian Social Life
Did the Natufians use stone mortars for processing cereals or acorns, although direct
evidence is lacking? Recent studies of stone "mortars" (a misleading term), indicate that
they are found in many Late Natufian sites (regardless of size/ecological setting), their
variety is wide, some specimens have been deliberately pierced at their bottom, and in
some cases a stone was firmly set into the shaft. Some could not have served for food
processing (size and morphology) and at Raqefet cave they are directly associated with
human burials. We suggest that many were manufactured as a communication means
within the community level.

[169] Differential carnivore damage by domesticated dogs in New Zealand: A potential
indicator of resource availability and foraging efficiency
Differential carnivore damage by domesticated dogs on faunal remains from New Zealand
sites may be related to differences in resource availability across space and through time.
Researchers have suggested that in areas where high-return vertebrate resources were not
as abundant, dogs may have been fed scraps such as discarded bone. In more resource-
rich areas, dogs may have had more access to meat, resulting in less carnivore damage on
bones. Here this hypothesis is tested by determining the degree carnivore damage on seal
and dog remains from four archaeological sites, which is then related to variability in
availability of high-ranked resources.

Late Classic burials came mainly from eastern shrine structures and several were found
containing multiple individuals consisting of adult males, females and subadults of varying
ages. These contexts are consistent with other cited examples of ancestor veneration

bison elsewhere within the Marias River drainage and these material variations are

[155] What a Waste: Identity Construction in the Archaeological Record of Southern
Mesoamerica
Ritual, symbolism, fancy pottery, monumental architecture, and other aspects of human
“identity construction” incur costs that would seem antithetical to fundamental biological
goals. This observation challenges us to ask why the peculiar circumstances of the human
niche might select for wasteful (seemingly non-optimal) phenotypes. Comparisons with
other species offer some insights. Once established, practices of "identity construction"
form lineages, which may or may not coincide with biological or linguistic lineages. Using
examples from southern Mesoamerica, this paper clarifies why identity construction is
"wasteful," why it occurs nonetheless, and how the resulting lineages evolve over time.

[235] Over the Hills and Far Away: accounting for nutshimit in the archaeology of coastal
Labrador
The Labrador Innu have a tenure that predates the arrival of Europeans by at least 1500
years. Much of what we know as their culture history is based on archeology and the
historical record, and much of this is rooted along the coast. The interior is frequently
considered for its basic role in subsistence and its reflection in settlement patterns, but
rarely as a significant place. To the Innu this is a major oversight. This paper addresses this
oversight, defining it by example and suggesting an alternative -total- role for Nutshimit in
archaeological descriptions.

The La Quemada mortuary assemblage (500-900 CE) presents opportunities and

persisted subsequent to imperial contraction and collapse. Still, Norte Chico Middle Horizon
ceramic styles and architectural traditions incorporate some typical Wari elements. These
trends, and an absence of local Wari administrative centers, suggest imperial influence but
not direct control. The observation of valley specific permutations to these general trends
within the Norte Chico suggests locally unique trajectories of political history.

products was essential for maintaining import of ores. During the transition from

Willendorf II. This site is one of the most important in Central Europe in part because it
spans the period from 45 to 23 ka BP. We conducted excavations concentrating on the
Aurignacian horizons with the aim of re-evaluating the stratigraphy and of collecting new
archaeological assemblages and samples for an extensive dating program (14C, TL and
OSL). We have discovered a new, very rich Aurignacian horizon between the formerly
known Classical and Early Aurignacian levels.

[91] Reindeer exploitation in the Quina Mousterian at Chez Pinaud, Jonzac (France)
The rich reindeer assemblage (NISP=5175, MNI=18) from a Quina Mousterian level at
Chez Pinaud, Jonzac (Charente-Maritime, France) provides an exceptional opportunity to
evaluate Neanderthal subsistence and ecology. The assemblage originates from a
remarkably dense bonebed. Preservation is excellent, anthropogenic modifications are
abundant, and carnivore influences are minimal. On-site butchery of carcasses and marrow
exploitation are indicated by the presence of all skeletal parts, abundant cut- and scraping-
marks, numerous hammerstone percussion marks, and bone flakes. Males, females and
juveniles are represented but adult individuals clearly predominate. Reindeer dominate
many Quina archaeofaunas and we evaluate the Jonzac data in this framework.

[226] Production and Distribution of Fine Black Wares During the Longshan Period in
Southeastern Shandong, China
Ever since initial excavations in 1936 at the Longshan period center of Liangchengzhen (c.
2500-1900 B.C.), southeastern Shandong has been well known for its thin-walled, polished,
fine black wares. Production locations and distribution networks, however, have not been
identified on the basis of systematic compositional analyses. This paper presents results
from LA-ICP-MS analysis using an initial sample of sherds collected from the Shandong
University-Field Museum collaborative excavations at Liangchengzhen (1999-2001) and
the large scale, regional survey (1995-2007). Preliminary hypotheses about distribution
patterns for fine wares during the Early and Middle Longshan periods are presented.

[159] The social organisation of technology? A Mesolithic case study from the Low
Countries.
Study of skill (transmission) in lithic technology improves our understanding of prehistoric
social organisation. The majority of these studies have been conducted on sites from flint-
rich regions. The technology used in these societies shows a high degree of
standardisation and a high level of skillfulness. The universal applicability of the criteria
generated in these studies is questioned. Two sites showing a simple, ad hoc knapping
technology, will be confronted with site showing a more complex technology and a higher
level of skillfulness. This confrontation generates new criteria and offers other lines of
interpretation, away from the simple master-pupil dichotomy.

Southwestern archaeologists previously understood the Early Agricultural period as a

archaeological insight gained from enhanced dating techniques and refined artifact
typologies continues to change the scholarly view of Early Agricultural subsistence
economies. This study uses off-site and on-site projectile point distributions to argue that
Early Agricultural populations became more efficient foragers after the introduction of
cultigens. In Northern Arizona, spatial data on the proximity of projectile points to desirable
resources provide evidence that Early Agricultural populations procured subsistence
resources more selectively than previous populations.

The domestic architecture of hunter-gatherers serves more than the utilitarian functions of

occupy shelters that encode and communicate information about their social and symbolic
traditions. Using examples from the northern Plains, the Canadian Arctic, Scandinavia, and
Siberia, this paper illustrates how the cosmology of nomadic populations around the globe
influences the design, construction, and use of skin-covered lodges. In fact, the differing
cosmologies generate a variety of organizational schemes for dealing with the practical
problems of creating a livable space for the occupants of these structures.

[201] Imperial Colonists and their Neighbors: The Shaping of Identities in a Frontier of Oyo
Empire
The Atlantic Age was suffused by empire formations. The European empires that
dominated the commercial activities across the Atlantic and in some parts of the Atlantic
basins have been the primary focus of archaeological scholarship. Yet, the drastic
economic changes that permeated the Atlantic basins after 1500 also created some of the
conditions for the rise of non-European empires in different parts of the world. One of such
imperial formations in West Africa was Oyo Empire, an hinterland hegemony that
developed in the late sixteenth century, and flourished through the seventeenth and
eighteenth centuries. The cultural pathways by which the city-state of Oyo was transformed
into an hegemonic empire is not well understood. Recent archaeological investigations
have, however, shed light on the dynamics of migrations, settlement strategies, and
material life in the very first successful colony that Oyo established in the pursuit of its
imperial ambitions. This presentation will examine the everyday material lives in the Oyo
frontier town of Ede-Ile, and in the neighboring settlement of Osogbo (about 24km apart).
The goal of the presentation is to highlight the strategies of identity formation between the
agents of the empire at Ede-Ile and the anti-imperial agents at Osogbo. The presentation
will address the collision between sociopolitical and economic aspects of identity formation
in a frontier environment, and the consequences for Oyo imperial project. The study will be
a contribution to the archaeology of frontier and boundary studies, identity formation,
colonization, and imperialist hegemony in Atlantic Africa with prospects for contextual
cross-cultural comparisons.

archaeological data on the trading port-cities of Chaul (India) and Mtwapa (Kenya). I argue
that bottoms-up modeling and innovative combinations of archaeology and ethnography
can provide alternative explanatory mechanisms for studying the development of ancient

[267] The 15th-17th Century Lithic Economy at Progresso Lagoon, Belize
The 15th century saw many changes at Progresso Lagoon, including the shifting of the
main settlement from the island of Caye Coco to the west shore of the lagoon. This paper
compares lithic data from Caye Coco and the shore settlement to illustrate the changing
political and economic climate of northern Belize. The abundance of projectile points
suggests increased inter-community conflict in the 15th century. Less inter-community and
long-distance trade is suggested by an increasingly self-sufficient and informal lithic
economy. Yet curation and recycling efforts indicate a continued preference for Colha
materials, despite the abandonment of the Colha workshops.

[33] Temporal changes in fishing strategies at Nu‘alolo Kai, Nâ Pali Coast, Kaua‘i, Hawai‘i
Marine resources were an integral component of prehistoric Hawaiian subsistence patterns.
This paper explores the diachronic changes in marine fishing strategies through
ichthyofaunal remains from Nu‘alolo Kai on Kaua‘i’s rugged Nâ Pali coast. Quantitative
analysis suggests that in earlier periods, the prehistoric inhabitants of Nu‘alolo Kai focused
on inshore reef fishes, and later shifted their fishing tactics within this zone to focus on
fishes that were living at the edges of the reef. Data are compared with other
archaeological assemblages from throughout Hawai‘i and the Pacific and with modern
demographics reef fish populations.

[238] New Analyses Of Hominin And Carnivore Damages In The Flk-Zinj Faunal
Assemblage: Interpretative Concordance And Conflict
Analyses of FLK-Zinj limb assemblage tool and tooth damages have - due to differences in
observed frequencies and the perceived explanatory efficacy of experimental models -
yielded different interpretations of hominin behaviour. New analyses of FLK-Zinj address
inter-observer variation in damage frequencies and the utility of existing experimental
models. Four points are made: 1) When appropriate samples are compared, all observers
report similar tool-mark frequencies. 2) Varied tooth-mark frequencies are due to difficulties
in interpreting inconspicuous marks. 3) Cut-marks are preferentially located on shafts,
indicating defleshing. 4) Tooth-marks on fracture surfaces of hammerstone-broken shafts
indicate carnivores scavenged hominin food-refuse.

[209] Archaeologies of Colonialism: Acculturation, Resistance and the Construction of
Aboriginality on the Northwest Coast
Colonialism had an enormous impact on New World Indigenous cultures – but what was its
specific nature? Conventional views have tended to explain cultural contact in terms of
acculturation, through comparing “traditional” cultures with their “colonized” cousins. More
recent interpretations have instead emphasized Indigenous strategies of resistance to the
colonial project. Which of these versions is closer to the mark, or is the history of this
process an altogether more complicated matter? This paper suggests a more balanced
way of thinking about colonialism by considering how the “active” role of material culture
was constitutive of new cultural middle grounds.

[240] Religious Syncretism: Native Cemi Idols and Christian Icons in Cuba and Hispaniola,
AD 1497-1514
This paper re-examines the old question of what is (religious) syncretism. It might be said
that, theoretically, syncretism can be one result among others of processes entailing
exchange and mobility. The two case studies from Cuba (1514) and Hispaniola (1496-7)
reveal the diverse values, beliefs, motivations and actions that the natives took in regard to
Christian and its aftermath. The Hispaniola case is one of sheer native repudiation and
resistance, but the Cuban example provides valuable clues to focus on syncretism as a
tense, dialogic phenomenon rather than merely a process of hybridization.

[190] Magnetic Gradient Imaging and Geochemical Evidence for Early Horse Corralling in
Northern Kazakhstan
Fourth millennium Copper Age Botai horse pastoralists were aberrant in the Eurasian
steppe for having large permanent settlements. Magnetic imaging of the Krasnyi Yar site
revealed post molds in curvilinear patterns indicative of enclosures, or corrals.
Geochemical analysis conducted on one enclosure determined manure had likely altered
soil constituents. Phosphorus concentrations in the HCl leachates for transect samples
were elevated, but nitrogen levels were comparatively low. This is expected for ancient
deposits, since nitrogen is highly mobile and readily depleted. Elevated sodium
concentrations may be indicative of horse urine. Corralling provides strong evidence for
horse domestication by the Copper Age.

[154] Reductive Technology and the Epipaleolithic of the Middle East and North Africa
More than 30 years ago, Arthur J. Jelinek recognized the importance of lithics as a
reductive, rather than additive, technology. This now commonplace observation, however,
,   422                                       ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING
is often ignored in lithics as “cultures.” Reductive technology limits available options in
knapping and retouching episodes, which, in turn, increases the potential for multiple
independent origins for lithic types and technologies. Resulting similarities are keys less to
shared cultural tradition than to the underlying nature of reduction and to strategic needs.
Issues raised by reductive technology are examined using Middle Eastern (Nebekian and
Zarzian) and North African (Egyptian and Iberomaurusian) Epipaleolithic assemblages.

[230] Late Holocene Fisheries in Gwaii Haanas: Species Composition, Trends in
Abundance, and Environmental or Cultural Explanations
Archaeological research in Gwaii Haanas (southern Haida Gwaii, British Columbia) has
documented a late Holocene shift from generalized economies to more specialized
economies dominated by salmon. The species composition of salmon assemblages from
this period, identified through a combination of radiographic and metric techniques,
indicates a focus on local salmon populations, and excludes the possibility that these
salmon were traded from major salmon rivers on the mainland. This shift towards an
intensive focus on the small salmon populations that spawn in southern Haida Gwaii likely
resulted from a combination of environmental changes and historically contingent cultural
developments.

Research in Northeast Thailand seems to indicate a change in the social organization from

increasing hierarchy and changing conceptions of the environment. The intensification of
agriculture may have had a profound effect on the socio-political structure and
contemporary conceptions of space. Similar developments have been noted for Iron Age

Vertebrate Fauna from Bayou St. John (1BA21), Baldwin County, Alabama, USA
The nature of regional subsistence patterns during the Woodland period is debated, yet
comparison of several southeastern faunal assemblages indicates distinct coastal versus
inland subsistence adaptations. Zooarchaeological evidence from Bayou St. John, located
in (1BA21), Baldwin County, Alabama, indicates that inhabitants of the site relied on locally-
available estuarine resources, with an emphasis on bony fishes. These dominant resources
are supplemented by deer, turtles, and a rich array of other wild taxa. Similar patterns are
identified at other coastal sites and contrast with those from inland locales, which tend to be
dominated by a broad spectrum of terrestrial and aquatic resources.

architecture developed in the Rio Grande.

[174] Food Storage Duration in Traditional Societies
In many past societies, food storage played a central role in both survival and emerging
cultural complexities. Many communities depended on stored foodstuffs to better cope
during “bad years” of natural and agricultural productivity. Of particular archaeological
importance, storage capabilities are also an important means of surplus accumulation.
Surpluses are associated with increased sedentism and tied to the emergence of social
inequalities. A current theory of political complexity builds on the idea of multi-year storage
capabilities; however this study incorporates assumed storage potentials based on
speculation, not on factual data. These preconceived values may not accurately reflect
actual storage durations.

One of the most familiar burial types in the southern Levant is the “bench-tomb”, found in
Judah during the Iron II period, or 1000-600 BCE. These tombs consist of rock-cut
chambers with stone benches along the walls facing the entrance, under which were cut
large pits serving as bone repositories. Traditionally interpreted as facilitating the addition of
further burials, these repositories, however, also bear witness to an elaborate and
widespread secondary mortuary ritual. Historical documents provide textual
correspondence between Israel’s practices and beliefs about the dead and societies whose
secondary mortuary practices and beliefs have been ethnographically demonstrated.

Geometric Morphometrics is an analytical technique designed to quantify morphological
variation between objects by generating shape variables and statistically evaluating their
variability. Although caliper ]based stone tool metrics are used in multivariate analyses of
morphological variation, these measurements might not account for the full variability in a
specimen’s overall shape. This study evaluates these two morphometric methods applied
to the same lithic assemblage. Results suggest that Geometric Morphometrics captures
more complete morphological information than caliper measurements.

Wari artifacts far from Ayacucho are often understood in terms of imperial domination or

different pattern, in which a widespread rural population of coastal farmers used a local
Huamanga grade variant of quotidian Wari ceramics. One small, tentatively identified Wari
administrative center was probably built centuries after the Huamanga ceramics were
adopted. Current evidence suggests a long-term, pervasive cultural relationship, but not a

death patterns to patterns generated in a series of model projections, revealing a
compelling fit to the skeletal data. Here we examine possible impacts of changing epidemic
frequency on child reproductive value. Life history theory predicts observed changes in
child reproductive value would cause fertility levels to rise into the Middle Ages then
decline. This pattern anticipates the European demographic transition.

Skeletal porosities, particularly vault and orbital lesions, are pervasive in Prehispanic

patterns are a hallmark disease pattern among these sedentary Ancestral Puebloan

[150] Reconstructing ancient Maya history today: Moving away from romanticism and
dogma towards historiography and science
Outmoded arguments first spawned by romantic explorers would eventually evolve into
dogmatic standpoints under the weight of influential figures of past century’s Maya
scholarship. Divergent approaches stems from new epigraphic and archaeological
advancements more in tune with the historical dimension of Maya civilization, severely
challenging past teleological perspectives about a theocratic society of “pacific sages”
obsessed with time, astronomy and arithmetics while exercising power from “vacant”
ceremonial centers that were thought to have followed a straight linear development from
modest Preclassic origins onwards, albeit the story that recent hieroglyphic decipherments
tell us today develops into a far different one.

Recently the ideas about settlements and their inhabitants in the Caribbean have changed.
No longer are these seen as isolated communities; the outline of a network of settlements

[153] Fortification as a social fact. Processes of social change and resistance in the Iron
Age of NW Iberian Peninsula
Social developments within the Iberian Peninsula comprise different regional trends, that
are better understood when considering both processes of social division and resistance.
Some areas, like the Northwest, show a wider success of the latter, well into the Iron Age.
However, that area is one of those where settlement fortification firstly emerges. The paper
will try to approach fortification as a “total social fact”, that can contribute to an analysis of
the development of social complexity, in parallel to two complementary arguments: the
oscillating social trends between change and resistance, and the tensions between
domestic (familiar) units and settlement communities.

During the Formative Period, San Estevan in Northern Belize developed a lithic industry in
which a wide range of production and consumption activities took place at the site itself.
These ranged from testing raw nodules of chert and chalcedony, to tool manufacture, use,
recycling and discard of exhausted tools. Many of the formal tool types are similar, but not
identical to those found in contemporaneous deposits at Colha, Cuello, Cerros, K’axob and
Pulltrouser Swamp in form and manufacturing techniques. This suggests the integration of

[72] Linearity and longhouses in the Dorset culture
Many sites of the prehistoric Dorset culture of Arctic Canada and Greenland contain two
distinctive types of feature: longhouses and hearth rows. Not known from preceding or
subsequent Arctic cultures, these features are often interpreted as having been created to
house seasonal aggregations where socializing and shaman's performances were
important activities. Implicit in most interpretations is that the activities were the cause of
the distinctive linear configurations of these features. In fact, the linearity can better be
explained in metaphorical terms. The activities at these sites, instead of shaping the
features, were shaped by them.

[173] Fire as Cultivator: The Ethnoarchaeology of Burning, Patch Creation, and Plant
Domestication
Human foragers frequently interact with their environment through the deliberate and
controlled application of fire to the landscape. This can modify and shape habitats,
influence resource availability, and potentially transform entire ecosystems. Here we use
evidence from the Australian arid zone and the Northwestern Great Basin to examine how
burning is used to reduce search, create patches, and promote the growth of economically
important plant resources. Our data indicate that using fire to increase the spatial and
temporal predictability of resources can be a production strategy no less ecologically
manipulative than those typically associated with farming.

context of this Late Neolithic monument to better understand its purpose. Remains of a
large village dating to c. 2600-2500 BC, contemporary with the erection of Stonehenge’s
sarsen stones, raise the possibility that its builders and celebrants lived there, probably on
a seasonal basis. The village enclosed a large open space with its own ceremonial focus –
a timber circle and associated avenue, both of which were aligned on midsummer and
midwinter solstice orientations. Stonehenge now appears to have been part of a much

[15] Long-Term Social Dynamics and the Emergence of Hereditary Inequality: A Prehistoric
Example from the Carpathian Basin
This paper examines the relationship between the organization of social groups and the
emergence of hereditary inequality on the prehistoric Great Hungarian Plain. In contrast to
recent models that emphasize the role of individual human agents in enacting social
transformations, the model proposed here suggests that changes in household and
settlement organization were necessary before hereditary inequality could become
formalized and institutionalized during the Bronze Age. A theoretical perspective that deals
not only with the role of human agents, but also the long-term trajectory of social
organization in a region, is essential for modeling the emergence of ‘complexity’ generally.

[230] Processing the Patterns: elusive archaeofaunal signatures of cod storage on the
North Pacific coast
Pacific cod are abundant in eastern North Pacific sites, yet there is little evaluation of
potential storage. Examination of skeletal part data from 15 sites spanning 5000 years
reveals most exhibit a preponderance of crania, which might be interpreted in the salmon
and Atlantic cod literature as consumption of fresh fish plus processing for storage. For
Pacific cod, this seems unlikely due to the disconnect between the dominant archaeofaunal
pattern and the scarce ethnohistoric record on cod storage. Alternatively, archaeofaunal
signatures of cod storage may be obscured by the co-location of processing, storage, and
consumption.

In the past two decades, the archaeology and paleoecology of the North Atlantic have been
transformed by a series of major international, interdisciplinary projects . Most have been
inspired by the theoretical framework of Historical Ecology (Crumley 1994) in their
investigation of the complex interactions of climate, landscape change, and human culture
in the region, and all have made geoarchaeology, archaeobotany, zooarchaeology and
human osteology part of their fundamental research design. Major regional research foci
include culture contact, the impact of climatic fluctuations of the medieval and early modern
period, and the varied environmental impacts of imported European agricultural systems
upon island ecosystems. The interaction between marine and terrestrial economies is a
cross cutting theme that unites virtually all investigations in the region. This paper presents
some of the results of this long term international collaboration and makes use of newly
available data sets and regional syntheses to provide a broad overview of Norse use of
marine resources for subsistence and for exchange in the North Atlantic.

social organization. While many archaeologists acknowledge, as Binford did, that foragers
and collectors lie at the ends of a continuum of possible settlement systems, in practice
they have been treated as two discrete adaptive alternatives. The risk with this approach is
that much of the potential variability in hunter-gatherer adaptations goes unrecognized.
Here we develop a formal spatial model of the forager-collector continuum and explore the
quantitative properties of this model strategies using agent-based models.

the resource. It will show how the work of the UK Archaeological Archives Forum has
tackled these issues and how a European working party aims to define a common
European standard for archaeological archives, which will form the basis for a Council of

[20] Trends in Women's Health and Labor Relations in the Ancestral Puebloan Southwest:
A Bioarchaeological Approach
This paper will track trends in women's health and labor performance from the earliest
Pueblo I period villages through the late prehistoric and protohistoric period, drawing on
bioarchaeological and ethnographic data. Emphasis is placed on reconstructing the
experience of women across time in Pueblo communities through combined
bioarchaeological techniques. The bioarchaeological results of multiple studies are used to
contextualize the position of prehistoric women in the complex economic and power
relations of the Ancestral Pueblo.

[152] Interior Sites on Santa Cruz Island: Terrestrial Resources and Residential Mobility in
the Middle Holocene
As the largest and most diverse of the California Channel Islands, Santa Cruz Island is
well-suited for investigating terrestrial resource exploitation. Four sites recently excavated
in its Central Valley have yielded insights into what kinds of interior resources were
targeted, as well as the nature of residential mobility and population density. Dating to the
middle Holocene, these sites were inhabited by seasonally mobile, broad-spectrum
foragers who transported shellfish, fish, and sea mammals to interior locales. Reasons for
seasonal occupation of the Central Valley and the efforts expended in transporting marine
resources are considered, including access to plants and lithic materials.

[3] Exploring ancient cemeteries using ground penetrating radar (GPR): the case of Wadi
Ramm, Jordan
The Nabataean-Roman site of Wadi Ramm in southern Jordan served as a trade and
religious center from at least the 1st to 4th centuries A.D. In 2005 we employed GPR to
help identify a cemetery associated with the ancient site. Ground truthing of the GPR and
reconnaissance survey results in 2007 discovered a number of ancient anthropogenic
features, including an ancient cemetery. A number of linear subsurface anomalies explored
this season appeared to be natural features, however. This investigation demonstrates the
potential and limitations with using GPR to explore ancient cemeteries and architecture.

[22] Regional Variability in the Earliest Hierarchical Societies of Northern China
This paper examines the variability to be observed archaeologically in the nature and
degree of social inequality in the earliest hierarchical societies of three regions of northern
China: the Middle Yellow River Valley, the Lower Yellow River Valley, and the Western Liao
River Valley. Analysis of regional settlement survey data and household artifact
assemblages, as well as estimates of labor investment in burials and monumental
architecture are used to highlight differences between regions in terms of supra-local
political organization, social hierarchy, and economic specialization within communities.
Explanations for these patterned differences in complex societal development are
proposed.

[161] Social differentiation in early agricultural villages: a gendered alaysis from the Levant
The emergence of large farming villages is often correlated with increased social

the early Neolithic societies in the Levant were organized hierarchically in terms of gender.
A growing corpus of bioarchaeological research provides considerable insight into the
activities and organization of work. In addition well-preserved architecture and numerous
figurative representations provide data useful in this investigation.

[313] Implications of Trace Element Analysis of Fused Shale on Models of Obsidian
Procurement in Southern California
Fused shale, a glassy combustion metamorphic rock particular to Santa Barbara and
Ventura Counties, can be difficult to visually distinguish from obsidian. Besides
macroscopic likeness, trace element analysis shows that fused shale and Obsidian Butte
(Imperial County) obsidian share a similar Rb/Sr/Zr elemental signature that may have led
to misidentification of material types in previous sourcing research. Recent data indicate
that fused shale has been misidentified as obsidian in some coastal assemblages,
prompting us to reevaluate the significance of Obsidian Butte glass during Late Prehistoric
times in coastal southern California and its impact on extant resource procurement models.

[142] A Summary of Investigation at the St. Johns Site
Excavations at the St. Johns Site (35MU44/46) in northwest Portland in 2003-2004
confirmed that the site was a Chinookan village with houses, occupied shortly before
contact. People lived there probably throughout the year and gathered nearby abundant
resources, including wapato. At its peak (A.D. 1440 and 1800), it probably housed 200-400
inhabitants. Site abandonment may have occurred following the smallpox epidemic of A.D.
1775, although evidence of this is not conclusive. The St. Johns Site is an important
example of late prehistoric and contact-period habitation and land use by the Chinookan
people of the Portland Basin.

Survey, excavation, and collections research have attempted to determine late mid-
Holocene settlement patterns in the Pecatonica River valley of north-central Illinois and
southwestern Wisconsin. This period corresponds to the end of the Hypsithermal, a time of
cultural adjustment to large-scale climatic changes. Groups within the Pecatonica River
Valley were well suited to adapt to the changing climate because of the diversity of
landscapes within the valley. The presence of both glaciated and non-glaciated landforms
and the ecotone of the Prairie Peninsula and Southern Mesic Forest supplied a diversity of
resource and settlement opportunities that buffered the effects of climate change.

ornament production strategies involve punching, grinding, and scoring. Fossil gastropod
remains are hypothesized to serve as concordant cultural affiliation indicators in the Knife-
Heart Region. Ahler’s (1993) Ethnic Tradition identifications, especially with respect to the

The Zagros Mountains are home to prime assemblages of sheep and goat remains which
offer evidence of the transition from hunting to herding and early livestock domestication.
This study focuses on constructing age curves which reflect a demographic shift typical of
herd management using dental remains from the sites of Ganj Dareh, Ali Kosh, and Tepe
Sabz. Standards for determining sex, taxa, and age based on dentition are evaluated using

[296] Pastoral Economies in Early Transcaucasian Communities
The Early Transcaucasian Culture complex emerged around 3500 B.C. and rapidly spread
throughout the southern Caucasus, eastern Anatolia, northwestern Iran, and even as far as
the Levant. Many researchers have suggested that a form of mobile pastoralism facilitated
the dispersal of the ETC complex. Using zooarchaeological evidence, this paper instead
argues that settled agro-pastoralism served as the economic base of some ETC
communities, where the primary goal was to minimize risk and uncertainty. The faunal
remains from the sites under investigation demonstrate that herd security and subsistence
diversification were two key strategies aimed at reducing risk in the ETC economy.

associated with hunting activities with little evidence of change in subsistence, which
contrasts with the importance of corn observed in more southerly regions. Macro-tools,
such as grinding stones, may document changes in diet. We present here a preliminary
study of two sites that focuses on how these tools were produced and used.

Island Complexity
Weeden Island has long been recognized as an example of precocious sociopolitical

of Weeden Island organization are incomplete; the lineage model, in emphasizing local
autonomy, does not provide a mechanism to account for the similarities that developed
across the region. Such similarities are better explained through the existence of social
relationships that cross-cut lineages and villages.

revealed the extent of the extant facilities associated with John Moultrie's Belle Vista
Plantation (Site NP 18), later owned by James Moss. Archival research provides support
for the interpretation of the buildings ruins in two settlement areas. Detailed mapping of
stone walls provide an outline of the Loyalist era landscape associated with Belle Vista.
Artifacts, layout, and construction techniques are compared to the results of earlier
investigations at NP 18 and similar information from nearby Clifton Plantation.

[229] Military Confederacy or Egalitarian Polity? The Difficulty of Reconstructing Politics in
Ancient Pastoral Societies
Although the literature concerning modern pastoralists often centers on politics,
archaeologists tend to gloss over the issue. For example, archaeologists of Eurasia often
connect burial type with certain forms of politics, associating kurgans devoted to an
individual or family with a hierarchical political structure and relating kurgans that contain a
representative sample of the population with egalitarianism. This method for determining
politics ignores the questions of land tenure and land use that are often more vital to
understanding pastoral politics. This paper will bring together archaeological and
environmental data to provide a different picture of politics in Bronze Age Eurasia.

[268] Religious Heterodoxy and Rural Hybridity across the Middle Islamic Dhiban Plateau
(Jordan)
With the installment of Muslim power under the Ayyubid and Mamluk empires in the mid-
thirteenth century, Islamic institutions and practices were introduced into the Levant
following two centuries of medieval Crusader rule. The Dhiban Plateau, a relatively isolated
cross-section of modern Central Jordan, presents an interesting context in which to
investigate how rural agricultural communities took up these elements of Islamic piety and
combined them with previous modes of religious expression. This paper draws on models
of hybridity, syncretism, and heterodoxy to inspire more nuanced interpretation of religious
identities and practice during the Middle Islamic Period.

[115] Plant uses at el-Wad terrace (Mount Carmel, Israel): The phytolith evidence
El-Wad is one of the larger Natufian base camps of the Mediterranean core-area.
Quantitative, morphologic and morphometric analyses of phytoliths was conducted there to
identify the plants used in specific archaeological context. The results show that pooid
grasses dominated the phytolith record. High concentrations of phytoliths from grass leaves
and stems suggested dwelling remains, an important element of Natufian plant exploitation.
Phytoliths also indicated that wood and bark were the second most abundant form of
vegetation preserved in the site. This study provides new data about Natufian populations
on the threshold of early food producing communities in the Levant.

[76] Entering a Global World - Imperialism and Power in late 19th Century Uganda: an
archaeological perspective
Globalization is somewhat synonymous with Imperialism in Northern Uganda. Uncontrolled
exploitation of ivory and slaves led to the introduction of a British presence controlling an
Egyptian military. For 30 years a series of Europeans, Samuel Baker, Charles Gordon and
Eduard Schnitzer (Emin Pasha) established more than 20 military stations in the southern
Sudan and northern Uganda. Test excavations have been conducted at 3 sites. Power was
exercised through a predatory military presence but assimilation into the local community
was a necessity and is reflected in the archaeological record. There is a great potential for
Imperial Archaeology in East Africa.

[53] Clovis Technological Organization at the Sheaman Site, Eastern Wyoming: An
Assemblage Level Test of the High-Tech Forager Hypothesis
Although traditional interpretations of Paleoindian technological organization are framed
within the “high-technology forager” model, recent critiques suggest that few sites actually
satisfy the model’s archaeological predictions. However, the high-tech forager model was
designed to explain the technological strategies of only the earliest occupants of North
America, and the applicability of the model to Clovis technology has not been explicitly
tested. This paper provides an assemblage level test of the high-tech forager model using
the lithic assemblage from the Sheaman Clovis site in eastern Wyoming. The assemblage
fulfills the model’s expectations, and appears unique in many ways compared to later
Paleoindian manifestations.

[104] Refuse Disposal Practices in Terrace Contexts and Their Implications for Residential
Organization at Cerro de las Trincheras, Sonora, Mexico
Dry-masonry terraces formed the basis for residence at Cerro de las Trincheras, a late
prehistoric hill town in Sonora, Mexico. Analytically, the terraces represent palimpsests of a
range of cultural practices and site formation processes. Living, working and disposing of
waste on a hill constrains and enables the ways residents use space. For archaeologists
working to identify residential groups, these forces pose interesting interpretive challenges.
Using ethnographic and site data, this paper examines excavated terraces as loci for refuse
creation, disposal and reuse and discusses the impact of these practices for the study of
residential group organization.

take into account the availability of other tool making materials such as metal. By

are subjectively and inconsistently defined (or even undefined), and thus not suited to
serious comparative analyses. Although some well-reasoned critiques of this subjective
approach were published beginning over two decades ago, such critiques have fallen

widened to include archiving and publication. In recent years, work has focused on the
development of more sophisticated interfaces and tools within the IADB to create a
collaborative research environment and publication framework for all aspects of fieldwork

[34] Social and Political Organization at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico.
We review past and current research on the nature of social and political organization at
the Prehispanic site of Casas Grandes (Paquimé), Chihuahua, Mexico. In particular, we
focus on the Medio period (ca. A.D. 1200-1450) emergence of this complex community. We
begin by reviewing Charles DiPeso’s perceptions regarding social and political organization
at Casas Grandes. We also discuss how his interpretation of the site influenced ensuing
work. Subsequently, we evaluate more recent evidence for social and political organization
at the site gleaned from architecture, craft production, animal husbandry, human burials,
trade goods, and ritual spaces and artifacts.

[233] Teotihuacan Traditions at Copan, Honduras
A reassessment of Teotihuacan cultural elements at Copan throughout its Classic dynastic
history supports a Maya-Teotihuacan dual identity among Copan’s elites. Temple 16, a
Late Classic building in the city’s Acropolis, was created to reaffirm the Highland Mexican
cultural roots brought to Copan several hundred years earlier by its first Maya king, K’inich
Yax K’uk’ Mo’. Decorated with hybrid imagery, the temple represents a unique picture of
this dual identity, and demonstrates that while the golden age of Teotihuacan had passed,
its memory could still be called upon to legitimize the rulership of Mesoamerican kings.

[315] Seeds of Change: Can Botanical Remains Elucidate Settlement Type in the Ancient
Near East?
When trying to establish settlement types and patterns for ancient sites in the Near East,
botanical remains may be able to offer some assistance as they can provide concrete
evidence for not only the economic system that was in practice but also the type of
environment that would have been present in a region in the past. After examining the
archaeobotanical material from several sites in Israel and Jordan it is possible to determine
to what extent botanical remains can be helpful in the reconstruction of settlement type and
how these sites would have functioned in the larger agrarian economy.

[19] Remapping Archaic Social Histories along the St. Johns River, Florida
Among present-day hunter-gatherers, traditions of settlement structure and location provide
frames of reference for negotiating local and regional social relationships through mundane
and ritual practice. This paper examines how such traditions emerged as an ongoing
historical process during the Archaic period (6200-3500 BP) along Florida’s St. Johns
River. A consideration of depositional histories of monumental shell mounds reveals that
inhabitants variously reproduced, transformed, and extended domestic places and
practices as formalized commemorative events. At larger scales, these transformations
register the social reconfiguration and remapping of the St. Johns as new ecologies and
identities were locally incorporated and differentiated.

[91] A Morphometric Technique for Assessing Prehistoric Freshwater Mussel Population
Dynamics (Family Unionidae) in North Texas
Measured shell length taken from extant freshwater mussel populations is often used to
determine ontogenetic-age structures. Unlike contemporary specimens, paleozoological
mussels are often fragmented and are rarely preserved well enough to measure shell
length. Pallial line to lateral tooth length (PL-L) has been suggested as an accurate proxy
for shell length, and is tested for validity using seven freshwater mussel species found in
North Texas. PL-L measurements prove to be an accurate proxy for shell length and are
applied to two mussel species from three archaeological sites in North Texas, to determine
recruitment for prehistoric mussel communities.

Among the pre-contact hunter-gatherers of Newfoundland and Labrador the domestic

physical and sacred landscape. This paper will examine a series of lithic caches recovered

contained graves with content of bodies and organic material preserved by a unique interior
anaerobe environment. A series of experiments explored whether this was due to natural

[46] When is a Defensive Site? Coping with Conflict in Central New Mexico
Population aggregation during the 12th century in the Salinas area of New Mexico involved
construction of plaza-oriented pueblos and a shift in settlement to upland locations—
strategies commonly attributed to vague and generalized “defensive needs.” Excavation at
an early pueblo provides evidence of continuing architectural renovation, apparently for
defense; pueblo-wide burning of intact roof assemblages attests to the reality of conflict.
These data allow us to move beyond generalizations into specific evidence of the conduct
of warfare, selection of tactics for defense, and the effects of actual and potential conflict on
small-scale communities.

Analysis
Phytolith studies of ceramic residues demonstrate the feasibility of identifying those plants

The implications of an agent-based model (ABM) for birth spacing decisions by hunter-

population equilibrium depends on the degree to which growth translates into increased
cost for obtaining food resources by women. Two patterns are predicted for lineage forms
of social organization depending on: (1) a lineage absorbs the consequences of a positive
growth rate growth or (2) a lineage splits into sublineages. Data on paramount states show
remarkably close agreement with the prediction of two distinct patterns for population size
compared with number of basic social units.

Many see most Nahua child sacrifices as involving rain gods. However, while some have
plumbed the deep cosmological attitudes potentially shaping these rituals, fewer have
explored the formative role of Nahua cultural views on childhood itself. Nahua views of
childhood were commensurate with a worldview centering on complex notions of a
sometimes violently transformative materiality. Unlike western ideas of childish spiritual
innocence, children were both responsive and responsible players in a world in which death
was a necessary actor. Habits of destruction helped ingrain this reality as children
themselves were often lovingly led into full social.

[114] Native Economies at Spanish Contact in coastal Southern California: Food Producers
or Collectors?
Protohistoric subsistence studies in coastal southern California have been held captive to
the region's rich ethnohistoric record. Scholars have generally relied upon ethnohistoric
accounts of plant gathering strategies and food preparation methods to characterize Native
American groups at Spanish contact as incipient food producers. As a result, analysis of
data from coastal southern California sites has lagged behind the pace of similar research
in other regions of North America. Drawing on recent theoretical discussions of low-level
food producers and the adoption of non-indigenous cultivars, this talk lays a framework for
exploring changes in Protohistoric economies in coastal southern California.

Pleistocene Jaguay Phase (~13,000-11,400 cal BP), Early to Mid-Holocene Machas Phase
(~10,400-7750 cal BP), and Late Holocene Manos Phase (~3600 cal BP). All sites relied on
marine resources; the Jaguay site has the clearest evidence of contact with highlands;
Machas sites show regional “settling in”; and Manos sites have more diversified
subsistence but least evidence of interzonal contact. These shifts in long-distance
interaction and settlement patterns suggest environmental and social change since the

and medicine societies whose rituals focused on those cosmological portals that are an
inherent attribute of the dark world of the cave.

extraordinary in its size (2 hectares), longevity (over 700 years) and well-preserved
dwelling architecture, consisting of over 75 structures, many of which are around 100m2.
Faunal and artefactual data suggest an economic specialization on late winter harp seal
hunting and the subsequent processing of sealskins. Recent palynological work has shown
that site activities were sufficiently intensive to affect the limnology of a nearby pond. This
paper argues that, like the rich salmon runs of coastal Alaska and British Columbia, the
predictable harp seal concentrations off Phillip’s Garden presented opportunities for
optimization of yield through coordinated and concentrated efforts of hunters and
processors.

assemblages from Trinchera Cave (CO), and Kenton Caves (OK) were age dated,
analyzed, and compared to other known sandal collections throughout North America,
including Franktown Cave (CO). The appearance of similar sandal styles at these sites in

[7] The Prehistoric Archaeological Record of the Alpine and Sub-Alpine Zones of the
Eastern High Sierra Nevada
Recent archaeological inventories in the Ansel Adams and John Muir Wildernesses of the
Inyo National Forest have recorded prehistoric sites in the alpine and sub-alpine zones of
the east side of the High Sierra Nevada Mountains thus filling in the archaeological record
from Tioga Pass on the north to Mt. Whitney on the south. Site types range from so-called
sparse lithic scatters to seasonal occupation sites to extensive obsidian workshops
spanning approximately the past 7,500 years. This poster will provide a visual overview of
the area under discussion, the site locations, and pertinent information.

[138] Table of Wheat, Table of Corn: Consumer Choice Foodways and Social Prestige in
Early Colonial Puebla
This paper demonstrates that the process of food selection and material consumption in
Spanish and Indian households involves different elements related not only to income and
social status as stated by the consumer choice paradigm, but also food preference, flavor,
function, and social prestige. Based on historical documents, social prestige between Early
Colonial Cholula and Puebla seems to be an important element of ethnic distinction.
Therefore, this paper argues that consumer choice should be influenced by the concept of
social prestige and foodways more than income and market price.

[57] Dietary Plant Use by Middle Holocene Foragers in the Bonneville Basin, Western North
America
During the Middle Holocene, foraging societies in the Bonneville Basin significantly altered
their subsistence strategies by expanding and intensifying their utilization of relatively low-
ranked dietary plant resources and increasing their range of utilized habitats. These shifts
in human behavioral strategies occurred during a period of complex environmental changes
in the region. This paper explores trends and transitions in plant resource use in the
Bonneville Basin in the context of regional environmental variation through the Middle
Holocene.

[257] Time, Power, and the Production of Identities
I am interested in the role of time in Maya economies of power, particularly as time
provides a basis for articulating elite power and identities. Time is a social construct,
investigable through its representations, such as images and metaphors. These reveal that
Maya concepts of time were not only cyclical but animate and apotheosized. Such
conceptualizations provide the temporal contexts for analyzing and interpreting economic
activities, including the creation, exchange, and consumption of material objects that
underwrite elite identities and cosmp-political power. Elite participation in these processes
is a critical component of longer-term cycles of social reproduction and regeneration.

[260] Received and not-so-received wisdom about Athapaskan linguistics for
archaeologists
Use of linguistic evidence to complement the archaeological record of Athapaskan
migration is complicated by an equally fragmentary linguistic record. In contrast to
Amerindian, Athapaskan languages enjoy some unusual characteristics (e.g. large
phonological inventories, general resistance to borrowing). These factors should help in
dating the timing of differentiation among the daughter languages. However, other factors
(like spontaneous lexical innovation) complicate linguists’ efforts to establish cognate terms
for comparative purposes. This paper reviews some special features of Athapaskan
languages including their lexicalization patterns, indicating where and how we might look

[201] ‘The incertitude of customs…’: Colonial subjectivities, material experiences, and
ambiguous power in the Siin (Senegal), 1850s-1930s
Historical anthropology has transformed our understanding of colonialisms, by portraying a
complex archipelago of social worlds rife with ambiguities, cultural intertwinings, and
unstable power fields. While these ‘tensions of empire’ were often played out on material
terrains, one may wonder the extent to which they are manifested in archaeological
situations. Using textual and material archives, this paper examines the intersection of
colonial policy and local practice in Siin (Senegal) during the colonial period. These
encounters produced complex materialities and social strategies that offer glimpses into the
subjectivities, plural experiences, possibilities, and contradictions fashioned in the region
under French colonial rule.

[116] Stable isotope evidence for the Holocene use of marine resources in coastal British
Columbia
The Northwest coast of North America (i.e. coastal British Columbia) was one of the first
regions where the stable isotope method for reconstructing past human diets was applied
(Chisholm et al. 1982, Schoeninger et al. 1983). These early studies, based largely on later
Holocene material, indicated that coastal humans in this area often had very high amounts
of marine foods in their diets. In this paper I will review the isotopic evidence, including new
unpublished data, to show that coastal indigenous people throughout this region consumed
significant amounts of marine resources throughout the Holocene.

[28] Analysis of Skeletal Remains from a Viking-Age Icelandic Churchyard using Three
Dimensional Models
High-resolution 3D modeling has the potential to become a revolutionary tool in the
documentation and analysis of skeletal collections. 3D models of skeletal remains allow
morphological differences to be quantified in new ways with unprecedented precision. They
greatly facilitate the reconstruction of fragile, fragmentary skeletons. These methods were
used to study a settlement period skeletal collection from Mosfellsdalur, Iceland. Analysis of
cranial variation and bilateral asymmetry of the skull and long bones reveals considerable
morphological homogeneity and significant amounts of asymmetry, providing evidence of
the genetic relationships of the people buried in the cemetery as well as indicators of

were selected for review of four of their six criteria. The goal of review was to evaluate if the
seven site reports acknowledged and utilized those four criteria suggested by Turner and
Morris. Results varied due to researcher methodology, amount of available human skeletal

[150] The Huastec Sculptural Aesthetic: Defining Styles at Castillo de Teayo
Stylistic distinctions are indispensable when dealing with ancient artworks. Yet, a number of
potential pitfalls obfuscate the reliability of stylistic analysis, such as hybridization,
archaism, and ethnic attributions. In the Huasteca, a fruitful case study is the sculpture at
Castillo de Teayo. Emily Umberger rightly attributes some sculptures to the provincial Aztec
style. Nonetheless, one must also take into account the preexisting Huastec sculptural
tradition to make sense of Castillo de Teayo’s stylistic particularities. I will parse out the
Huastec from the provincial Aztec style and argue that the latter is not imposed, but rather
converges with the former.

[36] People, Pinnipeds, and Sea Otters of the North Pacific
Seals, sea lions, and sea otters are a fundamental component of marine ecosystems
around the world. Spending time in the ocean and on land, they are large and nutritious
resources that are highly vulnerable to human predation. Archaeological research
demonstrates that Pacific Coast peoples hunted and scavenged marine mammals for
millennia and greatly influenced their abundance, behavior, and distribution. Pinnipeds and
sea otters were also decimated historically during the fur trade, with many species
increasing under recent protection and conservation policies. In this paper, we synthesize
the modern and historical ecology of North Pacific pinnipeds and sea otters.

[100] Prospects and Challenges in the Detection of Hunter-Gatherer Niche Construction in
Prehistory. A Case Study from the Southern Scandinavian Late Glacial
Drawing on genetic, ecological/economic and material culture data from the Scandinavian
Late Palaeolithic, this paper aims to show how niche construction theory can profitably be
linked to the archaeological record. It argues that, importantly, large amounts of
archaeological information that are hitherto only incompletely incorporated into an
evolutionary approach to the human past, can be conceptualised as part of the human
ecological inheritance. In addition, archaeologists have already developed a battery of
techniques that enable an assessment of this information from a niche constructivist
perspective. A number of prospects and challenges for the future of niche construction
archaeology are identified.

Micromorphology was used to analyze thin sections from two Archaic period pits from the

compositions under the microscope. The black sediment from one of the pits is due to
dense charcoal. The other pit is composed of ancient and modern organic matter with little
charcoal and loosely packed microstructure. This suggests the two pits held different
functions in their final phase of use. Micromorphology has helped disprove the assumption
that dark sediment within features at Sandy Hill is due to the presence of charcoal.

create a social space where agents could feel that they belonged to a similar tradition even

reconstruction of mobility adaptations. Did Archaic Period bands practice high mobility
based on subsistence constraints with toolstone selection simply integrated into their
strategy or did procurement of raw material partially define mobility strategies?

mobility and raw material procurement and use.

Ancient Bunyoro-Kitara in Uganda has been called a segmentary state. However, recent

and authority derived from creative power, which invents forms of meaning and may be
considered to exist sui generis. Moreover, wealth was probably measured more in terms of
people than in goods. These insights promote a heterarchical view of the past that
improves our understanding of ancient Bunyoro-Kitara and also helps explain the role of
archaeology in modern Ugandan politics.

This presentation introduces the 2000 year history of the Chan site. Scholars have long

This is particularly the case in agrarian-based complex societies, like the ancient Maya.
Only by incorporating the detailed studies of farming communities into well-studied
analyses of civic-centers and regions can we adequately model the dynamics of
organization in a society. Adopting such an approach research at Chan (1) demonstrates
the complex and changing nature of farming community life and (2) explores the impact of
a farming community on larger socio-political relations and vice versa.

It is the burden and power of regional traditions that they must be built up from more or less
eclectic archaeological signatures on varied landscapes. Hunter-gatherer societies adapted
to ever-present environmental, social, and ritual factors. In New England, contrasting
technological systems are strongly correlated with both environmental zones and broad
ritual areas. In parts of this region, the “Archaic Period” (which comprises about 60 % of the
span of human occupation) may represent cultural continuity more strongly than
evolutionary change. Grand explanatory schemes must be disaggregated and fit to

[74] Uso alternativo de rocas y minerales verdes en Mesoamerica
El uso de rocas y minerales verdes en las sociedades prehispánicas fue amplio,
particularmente en las obras lapídeas. Entre los olmecas (>1200-900 a.C.) abundan piezas
de jadeitita gris, gris-azulosa y verde esmeralda, y serpentinitas verdes. En el sitio
occidental de El Opeño (1500-1000 a.C.) ocurren piezas de jadeitita gris y verde
esmeralda, que alternan con caolinita gris y azul, cuarcita verde, crisoprasa. El reemplazo
de materiales pudo deberse al agotamiento de los yacimientos o a la incorporación de
nuevos materiales como la turquesa y la amazonita (c.500 d.C.) en los sistemas de
distribución de bienes de lujo.

[260] Navajo Archaeology Comes of Age
Recent decades have brought major shifts in the data available for Navajo archaeology and
consequently in the problems accessible for archaeological research. With rare exceptions,
Navajo archaeology through the 1970s concentrated on direct historical approaches to
Navajo origins, often relying on isolated site reports and relatively speculative models of
Athapaskan arrival in the Southwest. Improved strategies for dating late prehistoric sites
has opened up the early period of Navajo occupation in the Southwest to more direct study,
while large regional CRM-generated databases have broadened research questions to
include economic, social and political transformations throughout Navajo prehistory and
recent history.

[174] Archaeology of Unfamiliar Places: A Report on Updates to the Landscape Learning
Process Model
I first proposed the landscape learning model 10 years ago as a means of comparing the
processes of initial colonization and environmental familiarization across time and space.
Since that time, the model has been defined as consisting of three types of environmental
knowledge (namely, locational, limitational, and social knowledge) and has been applied to
a diverse array of contexts, including late glacial, Neolithic, and historical dispersals. This
paper presents a summary of recent and ongoing efforts to update to the landscape
learning model, including knowledge-type timeframes, ethnographic and
ethnoarchaeological contributions, relationship to evolutionary theory, and applications to
specific case studies.

[225] The Effects of Morphological Variables on Archaeological Use of Eleven Lava Tube
Caves on the Eastern Snake River Plain, Idaho
Archaeological investigations in eleven lava tube caves on the Eastern Snake River Plain
have produced a substantial record of prehistoric cave use. Morphologic variables including
the size and orientation of cave openings, depth and length of the cave, and proximity to
nearby caves influenced prehistoric use of the caves. Artifact assemblages indicate that the
caves were used archaeologically as habitation locations, lithic workshops, food storage,
and water collection areas. Speleocentric investigations are shedding light on the variations
in prehistoric cave utilization. This paper details the morphologic variables that contribute to
differences in archaeological utilization of lava tube caves in Idaho.

[114] European Contact, Public Architecture, and Cherokee Towns in the Southern

Public structures known as townhouses were hubs of public life in Cherokee towns before

Appalachians. This paper summarizes continuity and change in Cherokee townhouses
from late prehistory through the eighteenth century A.D. These trends are related to native
responses to European contact in the southeastern U.S. Townhouses were a source of
cultural stability and conservatism during a period of dramatic cultural change, and they
also were an architectural medium through which Cherokee towns adapted to the changing
environment of the Southeast.

Bioarchaeological studies have suggested that the Hohokam experienced poor health and

on Pueblo Grande, a Hohokam community on the Salt River, and community health among
the contemporaneous Hohokam populations located on the middle Gila River is largely
unknown. Ongoing investigations in the Gila River Indian Community provide data that are
used to evaluate regional trends in health patterns among individuals living within the
Hohokam core area, and to assess the role of health factors in the Classic period Hohokam

group variation, a rich mosaic of daily life distinctiveness can also be suggested, indicating
the need to improve comparative studies focused on these particularities.

[241] Estimation of Obsidian Hydration Rate by the Total Least Squares Method
Despite advances in laboratory techniques, most obsidian hydration rates today are
estimated by association of hydration rim thickness with other chronometric data, such as
radiocarbon. The rate is then computed as a linear least-squares best fit between
chronometric data points and the square of the rim thickness of the associated obsidian
artifacts. However, uncritical application of this technique can lead to significant errors in
the rate, due to tacit assumptions built into the mathematics of most least-squares
software. This paper discusses the source of these errors and describes a technique to
avoid or minimize them, the Total Least Squares algorithm.

[139] Skeletal remains as embodied past: building a picture of a prehistoric group from

Biological aspects of anthropological research emphasize population as a study unit, for a

focusing on a group as a unit of research, especially when examining burial rituals and the
associated skeletal remains. However, focusing on an individual as the source of
understanding is both tricky and fraught with problems. Building my case on detailed
analysis of burials from Muge shell middens, I will discuss this aspect of archaeological
research that relies heavily on bioarchaeological data in the burial context.

[185] Revisiting Settlement Patterns in North-Central Mexico
In an influential 1956 review of settlement patterns, J. Charles Kelley suggested a
continuum of four major complexes from Durango and Zacatecas in the south, northward to
the Rio Grande and southwest United States. The proposed continuum occurred in a
restricted ecological corridor east of the Sierra Madre Occidental. Current data support
Kelley's continuum, while allowing for increasingly specific observations about chronology,
distribution and settlement patterns. In several but not all instances there are gradational
zones between complexes, where local variability is evident within broader regional
patterns. The complexities of Kelley's original ecological corridor are also better
understood.

Central Arizona
Recent research at the Hall Point Site (AZ P:11:300 [ASM]) and reexamination of
contemporary Mogollon Rim pithouse sites indicates that clusters of pithouses that date
prior to AD 600 are not the remains of early agricultural villages. Rather, variability in
architectural form, storage features, paleobotanical assemblages, and post-abandonment
deposits suggest that Early Pithouse sites were loci of short-term, sporadic occupations by
mobile hunter-gatherer-gardeners. This poster presents chronometric, environmental, and
architectural data from Hall Point (cal AD 71-228) as well as comparisons to contemporary
Early Pithouse sites (AD 1-600) along the eastern Mogollon Rim.

[178] Non-state complex societies in South America: Implications for archaeological
method and theory
This presentation evaluates method and theory about elites in preindustrial states with
evidence from South America. The cultures of hierarchical and centralized elites were
considered necessary to organize intensive food production for growing populations in
resource-rich, heterogeneous regions. States would not, therefore, form in sparsely
populated, resource-poor, homogeneous regions. In the Andes and Amazonia, however,
prehistoric non-state societies achieved complex cultures with a range of different
subsistence and settlement systems in quite different ecological settings. The
archaeological patterns encourage reworking of the theories and research strategies.

[39] Introduction: Surveying the Landscapes of Central Lydia
The natural landscapes of central Lydia surrounding the Gygaean Lake include alluvial and
lacustrine plains, broad rolling hills, and steep, rocky ridges and peaks. These landscapes
were home to diverse sites throughout their history, beginning before the Early Bronze Age
and extending through the present. The current project takes a multi-pronged approach,
contextualizing a variety of paleoenvironmental and archaeological methods within a
landscape archaeological framework. We highlight the potential of systematic survey, aerial
and satellite image analysis, and high-accuracy GPS and geophysical mapping for
elucidating long-term environmental and cultural dynamics in this important area of western
Anatolia.

Widespread shifts in Hohokam settlement and lifeways are documented for the Classic
period, starting around AD 1100. This study looks at changes in Hohokam village
organization from a local perspective by comparing two Hohokam residential sites from the
Tucson Basin in Arizona. One site dates to the transitional Late Rincon phase (AD 1100-
1150) and the other primarily to the Tanque Verde phase (AD 1150-1325) of the Classic
period. Village-level courtyard group and residential patterns, craft specialization, and
subsistence are examined from these two sequentially occupied sites to better understand
the nature of changes in Classic period Hohokam social organization.

Natufian foragers are widely considered to be the direct forerunners of early agricultural
societies in the Eastern Mediterranean Levant. However, little is known about their patterns
of plant exploitation in general and their use of cereals in particular. This study reports on
results from the phytolith analyses of several Natufian sites located in the Mediterranean
core zone of Natufian culture. Preliminary results suggest that there might be significant
differences between plant exploitation in Early versus Final Natufian Periods. Although
grass-seeds are actively exploited, a variety of grass genera were used, rather than a focus
on wild wheat and barley.

[27] Material Strategies of Asian Immigrant Labourers in British Columbia
Until recently, archaeologists studying Asian immigrants in western North America have
focused almost exclusively on the Overseas Chinese. Very little comparative work has
been done to identify how, from a material culture perspective, the processes and
challenges of adaptation to a new and foreign environment varied between Chinese and
other Asian groups. Excavation of discrete Chinese and Japanese deposits from an early
20th century British Columbia salmon cannery provides an opportunity to draw such
comparisons within one local context. Results suggest that demographics, labour relations,
and cultural-historical legacy all play a role in producing quite distinctive assemblages.

Our understanding of Late Archaic/Early Agricultural occupations of the Santa Cruz River

recent projects that have documented deeply buried Archaic deposits to challenge the
notion that these occupations occurred as discrete entities with formal boundaries. Instead,
we argue that floodplain occupations should be examined on a larger scale, and may
represent fluid and variable use of the floodplain.

prehistoric ditch within the site. Numerous other large prehistoric features were identified as
well. Feature excavations, radiocarbon dating, magnetic susceptibility data and previously
conducted pedestrian surveys were also used in the interpretation of intrasite patterning.

[296] Specialized Pastoral Production to Meet Urban Demand: An Early Bronze Age
Example from the Khabur Basin, Syria
Archaeological investigation in the Khabur Basin documents initial urbanization during the
3rd millennium BC. The growth of urban centers entailed changes in subsistence practices
throughout the region. Among the new developments, socio-economic incorporation of
pastoralists into the nascent urban system was of particular import. The new economic
reality required a greater organization of livestock management in order to support an
intensification of pastoral production. Employing faunal data from five sites, this paper
explores the strategies used by ancient herders of the Khabur Basin to negotiate the
potential risks and rewards of an increasingly specialized pastoralism within an urban
complex.

Yields New Data
Starch grain analysis of grinding stones from Jiskairumoko, an early village site in the
highland south-central Andes, illuminates the importance of roots and tubers to populations
shifting from hunting-gathering to agro-pastoralism. Results demonstrate the processing of
plants ultimately forming the foundation of high-elevation Andean agriculture, including
Solanum (potato) and Lepidium (maca). Comparison of starch from modern domesticated
potato with starches from its closely related wild relatives indicates the possibility of
distinguishing between domesticated and wild taxa. Jiskairumoko’s starch record suggests
that, by ~3800-3300 BP, potato had been domesticated and freeze-drying, a technological
innovation with far-reaching implications, developed.

social architecture utilized in communal cohesion and ceremony.

[11] Compositional Variability in the Albanian Neolithic, Copper and Bronze Age Pottery
Due to the long political isolation, Albania was deprived from many new technologically
advanced methods used in the archaeological research in other countries. Under the
support of the archaeological program of CSULB, and the Albanian Archaeological
Institute, I collected and analyzed pottery from sites with a wide spatial distribution, and a
time-line from Neolithic to Bronze Age. By acquiring the chemical composition of these
ceramics, we gain a better understanding of trade roots, cultural zones and ethnic
affiliations. There will also be an attempt to date the ceramics using luminescence isochron
dating, which will be extremely helpful for the Albanian archaeology.

[294] Variability in Hunter-Gatherer Architecture: socially significant or practically
meaningless?
Archaeologists often infer social behaviours from architecture, frequently viewing structures
as emblems of a society’s social environment. This viewpoint is especially common for
sedentary societies, where researchers use elements of structural design to deduce group
social constructs or worldview. But is this concept of architecture valid for the oft-times
lower cost residential structures built by mobile foragers such as the Late Dorset (1500-500
B.P.), an arctic-adapted hunter-gatherer society? Is the high degree of dwelling variability
typical of Dorset imbedded with myriad ideational meanings, or is ephemeral architecture
by its nature less suitable for investigating social ideology and behaviour?

[46] A Chronological Reconstruction of Occupation at Albert Porter Pueblo
Excavations conducted at Albert Porter Pueblo–located in southwestern Colorado–at the
Chaco-era great house and its surrounding community indicate this site was occupied
discontinuously from A.D. 750 until the tenth-century, and occupied continuously from
approximately A.D. 1060 until A.D 1280, or regional depopulation. Unlike many other
community centers in the region, the great house at Porter remained a focal point of the
larger community for two centuries. This poster presents a reconstruction of the
occupational history of Albert Porter Pueblo using tree-ring dates, architectural
characteristics, stratigraphic sequences, and pottery assemblages gathered during four
seasons of field work.

[11] Luminescence dating of prehistoric Hohokam irrigation canals using IRSL and SAR
analyses
Prehistoric irrigation canals are difficult to accurately date using traditional methods of
locating charcoal or diagnostic ceramics within the canal fill. As Berger and colleagues
(2004) demonstrated, luminescence dating using infrared light stimulation of fine-grained
feldspars and multiple single-aliquot measurements are capable of producing reliable dates
for the filling episodes of canal sediments. We report the results of a project to generate
ages for sediments from Hohokam canals collected from a site on the ASU campus. The
results demonstrate the potential of luminescence dating for generating new knowledge
about the history of prehistoric canals in the southwest.

[133] Late Prehistoric Settlement Choices in the Mid-Fraser Region on the Canadian
Plateau
This research utilized GIS environment-based site location, viewshed and least cost path
analyses to explore how ecological and sociopolitical factors affected the location of
prehistoric village sites. The environment-based site location analysis explains why the
majority of villages are situated on their locations in terms of resource exploitation.
However, this analysis has difficulty explaining why several village sites were located on
mountainsides and high elevations. Viewshed analysis in association with least cost path
analysis demonstrates that these locations were suitable for surveillance over paths and
defense rather than optimal resource exploitation.

[280] Caves and the Association with the 'Land of the Dead': A Critical Rethinking
Since the 1970's, archaeologists have proposed models of caves as leading to or being
associated with the underworld and the land of the dead. The model is used to explain the
meaning of caves or the presence of human skeletal material in caves. The strong
resemblance of the model to the Greek idea of Hades suggests that such ideas need to be
reexamined. This paper critically reviews ethnographic evidence for the association of
caves with death and the disposal of the dead. Data suggest that a great deal more caution
needs to be exercised in the application of such models.

[194] Moving Inland: The Evolution of Riverine Settlement in Alaska’s Kodiak Archipelago
Over the 7,500-year course of Kodiak prehistory, settlement of the Islands’ interior
environments increased dramatically. The size, frequency, variety and permanence of sites
flanking rivers and lakes far from the Gulf of Alaska coast all expanded as the human
population grew and increased in social complexity. This paper models riverine settlement
for the Kodiak region. It discusses the economic motivations for riverine settlement,
considers how inland harvesting may have been part of the broader economic strategy of
Kodiak societies through time, and then examines settlement data from recently surveyed

Different approaches to landscape use both reflected and created community integration in
two Late Postclassic Pipil polities, the Izalcos in western El Salvador and Cuscatlan in
central El Salvador. The Pipil of Cuscatlan may have arrived earlier and their centralized
settlement organization indicates the emphasis of the Nahua institution of the tecalli and
possibly an eastern Nahua heritage. The Izalcos probably arrived later and their dispersed
settlement pattern suggests emphasis on the Nahua institution of the tecpan and possibly a
western Nahua heritage. Landscape, history, and material expression all integrate the

[101] Seen but Not Herd: opportunistic pastoralists among the Seacow River Bushmen,
South Africa.
The Seacow River Bushmen were first encountered by Dutch trekboers in central South
Africa during the late AD 1700s. Although hunter-gatherers without livestock, they soon
excelled in service as shepherds. Archaeological research shows they had a long history of
erratic livestock ownership in preceding centuries. Direct dates on fiber temper in sherds
associated with low, drystone stock corrals show they first acquired livestock from
Khoekhoe herders who had penetrated the Seacow valley in the AD 1400s. The
subsequent archaeological record is one of complex interactions between the invaders,
part-time Bushman pastoralists and full-time hunter-gatherers.

Lessons from the Field on Bridging Novel Search Methods and Phenomenology
Archaeological search strategies have varied widely depending on the context of
investigation. Increasingly, technological capabilities in remote sensing and GIS have
contributed to the reliance by archaeologists on computers to help distinguish areas of
“high potential”. This paper discusses the role of archaeologists in contemporary research
incorporating such tools as LiDAR and GIS. Based on 2007 field research using these
technologies to help select archaeological test locations within the NE Graham Island

collective burials by individual burials in Bronze Age, and progressive increase in the
complexity of the settlements. Rock art worked as a symbolic device to legitimate these
transformations.

Hunter-gatherer prehistories of Eastern North America have been written as if they were
evolution, as if they were ecology. How would these prehistories read as if they were
history? Constrained by “as if” philosophy, historical narratives of ancient human
experience are no less hypothetical than alternative paradigms, but they implicate scales of
analysis and comparisons far different than the methods used to investigate hunter-
gatherers as evolution or ecology. Vignettes of Eastern Archaic prehistory illustrate how the
methods of historical processualism implicate testable hypotheses about material culture
and ritual practice “as if” ancient hunter-gatherers were agents of modernity.

gatherers living in the western Plains and Rocky Mountain, highlighting recent research in
the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. Archaeologists increasingly contribute to scholarship
on the worldwide impact of European expansion. However, studies of colonial impacts on
mobile hunter-gatherer societies are rare. Because hunter-gatherers typically avoid and
resolve conflict by moving, the effects of contact on nomadic people are difficult to trace.
We explore material signatures of pre and postcontact mobile hunter-gatherers,
emphasizing wilderness land use strategies, resource intensification, and technological
organization on the western North American frontier.

[270] Landscape Information among Hunter-Gatherers in Northwest Patagonia: Corridors,
Rock art and Archaeology
In Cordilleran Northwest Patagonia a Landscape Ecology approach was developed in order
to construct a spatial model for archaeological distributions (Scheinsohn and Matteucci
2004 a & b). As a result it was clear that most archaeological signals in the area consisted
in rock art sites located along corridors. Possibly, rock art sites were used as landmarks for
aid in environmental legibility (Golledge 2003). In order to determine how this information
was transmitted, NW Patagonia sites will be analysed by means of cladistics and
endemism analysis (Scheinsohn and Szumik in press).

[85] Looting and Mortuary Behavior at Pylos: Bioarchaeology of Mycenaean Tombs at the
Palace of Nestor
‘Disturbed’ tombs are usually assumed to have been looted for their valuables while their
other contents were ignored or scattered. Several other behaviors, including secondary
burial and tomb reuse, can produce similar archaeological signatures. To test if ‘looted’
tombs differ in systematic ways from non-disturbed interments, we compared tholos and
chamber tombs associated with the Bronze Age Palace of Nestor at Pylos for evidence of
tomb re-opening, spatial patterning of contents, taphonomic condition and representation of
bone, and tomb contents. The variation in the Pylos tombs suggests that mortuary
behaviors were complex and contributed to the disturbance of most burials.

Geophysical surveys play an important role in Cultural Resource Management. They can
be used to locate buried structures, help monitor the in situ preservation of such remains
and provide research information. All of these functions are also important when dealing
with World Heritage Sites which is demonstrated for three sites in South Asia: Lumbini, the

The Iberomaurusian is a Northwest African lithic industry characterized by the presence of
among other tools, backed microliths. Although there is a lengthy history of research on the
Iberomaurusian, many studies of the lithic assemblages are outdated. In light of renewed

with archaeological sites. This research tests groups of soil samples collected from various
contexts within contemporary Amerindian villages and compares them with samples
collected from nearby archaeological sites. Soil pH and organic carbon were measured and
a total extraction used to measure 22 elements with ICP OES. Results show that the

[40] Archaeology in Eritrea: A Victim of Colonial and Anti-Colonial Legacies
A postcolonial analysis of archaeology in Eritrea starts with the development of a national
identity deeply influenced by fascist Italian colonialism, when Eritrean identity first arose out
of Italian representations that privileged Eritreans over “primitive” Ethiopians. This ethos
gave birth to the liberation struggle’s control over knowledge production and valorization of
a military chain of command mentality. These attributes are amplified by a deep suspicion
of outsiders, increasing centrism, and the flowering of anti-intellectual forces that include
the systematic degradation of heritage resources and the dismemberment of higher
education, failures of Eritrea to grow beyond colonial and anti-colonial identities.

[243] Summer Air Temperature Reconstructions Over 1743-1993 AD Based on Freshwater
Pearl Mussels from Midden Deposits of Northern Europe
Margaritifera margaritifera can grow for ca. 300 years. Its shell growth patterns function as
reliable monitors of summer temperatures. Annual increment width chronologies of many
specimens can be combined into long time-series (master chronologies) that stretch over
multiple centuries and many generations of bivalves. Here, subfossil shell material was
obtained from shell middens and sedimentary deposits along rivers in Finland. The master
chronology enabled extension of the existing sclerochronology from Northern Europe back
to 1743 AD. This study demonstrates that midden shells can be used to reconstruct long-
term changes in terrestrial climate, thereby verifying and complementing climatologies
inferred from trees.

[223] Genomic Background of a Native American Private Allele: Support for the Beringian
Incubation Model
The distribution of the 9RA at genetic marker D9S1120 supports the hypothesis that all
modern Americans descend from a Beringian population. This inference assumes that
copies of the 9RA are identical by descent and that the allele is not under selection. We
studied the genomic region around D9S1120 in 44 populations from the Americas and
Asia. 90% of chromosomes with the 9RA have the same haplotype, suggesting most or all
copies descend from a single mutation. The length and frequency of the 9RA haplotype do
not suggest its distribution results from positive selection. Recombination within the
haplotype allows us to date the 9RA.

Reid Bryson’s macrophysical climate paradigm is an inductive model that accommodates
local climatic factors for paleoclimatic reconstructions. It is structured on inputs from

independence of proxy indicators, the typical data sets utilized by inter-disciplinary

by superposing findings from regionally diverse geoarchaeological studies across the

from contemporary texts. Written by educated males, these documents depict an idealized
world in which women and men fulfill the roles considered appropriate for their gender.
Analysis of the archaeological and human skeletal data, however, reveals that this
perception did not translate into the actual performance of gender identities. Activities
emphasized in the texts occur only rarely in the archaeological record. This paper
integrates the diverse lines of evidence to produce a more nuanced understanding of
gender, as perceived and performed, in early Irish society.

[81] Laptops in the Sand: Using Rugged Computers in the Field
Collecting data in a field environment via paper and pencil has been the standard for
decades. Previous attempts to introduce computers into harsh archaeological environments
have proven generally unsuccessful, often resulting in damaged equipment and wasted
money. While traditional data collection has a solid, time-tested past, the advent of rugged,
field-capable computers offers new exciting possibilities for today's archaeologist. This
paper reports the pros and cons of using Panasonic's Toughbook at two archaeological
sites in Utah's unforgiving deserts.

[147] The Wari footprint on the Central Coast. A view from Cajamarquilla and Pachacamac
MH urban centers have been pivotal in the construction of the expansive Wari state model.
However, some of those centers have been considered to be Wari imposed or inspired in
their origin on the basis of externally defined architectural diagnostics rather than results of
exhaustive fieldworks. Examination of preliminary results from our excavations (2000-2005)
at Cajamarquilla and Pachacamac on the Central Coast indicates imported Wari and Wari-
derived material remains are scarce and almost exclusively occur in funerary contexts. We
need new interpretive models that better consider the late Lima and other local
developments in defining the Wari-local interactions.

[234] Classic Maya Range Structures at Minanha, Belize
In this paper I plan on discussing the artifactual and architectural data recovered from
excavations conducted in a number of range structures at Minanha, Belize, in particular
structures excavated in the epicentre of the site. These excavations revealed a great deal
about these structures as possible locales for various public activities, and further analysis
has honed these findings, allowing for more nuanced inferences to be drawn. This paper
draws from multiple field seasons’ excavations at Minanha and comparative data from
throughout the Maya area, thereby allowing broader conclusions about this class of
structure to be made.

[184] Missing the forest for the trees: uses and abuses of projectile point typology in
Paleoindian archaeology
Nowhere are archaeologists more eager to dive into a discussion of projectile point
typology than in North America. Point types are used to touch on topics as varied as the
peopling of the New World, mobility, social or subsistence strategies. More problematic is
the use of typology to approach questions of cultural diversity. Can we answer these issues
by studying how weaponry changed through time and space? A clue is provided by a
historical perspective on how a typological feature such as fluting has been variously
interpreted through time and used to fit changing paradigms about the first Americans.

[211] The Anthropology of Mass-produced Footwear: Reflections on the significance of
shoes as funerary objects
From the Ancient Greeks to modern Judeo-Christian traditions, from the east to west, and
from Cinderella to Sex and the City, shoes have played an important role in belief systems,
myths, folklore and pop culture through the ages. Shoes recovered from cemetery contexts
are often interpreted by archaeologists merely as indicators of economic status.
Examination of several 19th century cemetery excavations, however, finds that shoes,
while continuing to be a status indicator, are much more meaningful. In cemetery contexts,
shoes are intensely personal objects that offer clues about status, health, religion, and
community and illustrate their value beyond basic utility.

[194] Economies of Driftwood: The Role of Extralocal Resources in Island Ecosystems
The Gulf of Alaska coastline exhibits extreme variation from east to west, encompassing
dense forests and windswept tundra. Maritime societies took advantage of ocean
circulation to moderate this resource patchiness, which was further exacerbated by
Holocene climate fluctuations. Driftwood, in particular, was used as fuelwood for 7,000+
years and likely buffered against wood shortages in delicate island ecosystems. Charcoal
analyses from the Kodiak Archipelago reveal a flexible, though increasingly selective
strategy of fuelwood use by early inhabitants. This study highlights the role of fuelwood in
general, and driftwood in particular, to northern mobility models and to definitions of
“maritime economy.”

show a dominance of bitter vetch, historically regarded as an “undesirable” food. It is here
argued that bitter vetch was produced for human not animal consumption, and the
dominance of this taxon is considered in light of agricultural production within marginal
environments, and the relationship between environment and group identity.

[84] The Architecture of Ancient Maya Saltmaking; Distribution and Analysis of Preserved
Wooden Posts at the John Spang Site in Paynes Creek National Park, Belize
This paper presents the analysis from archaeological investigations undertaken in 2006 at
the John Spang Site, a Late Classic Maya saltwork, in Punta Ycacos Lagoon, in Paynes
Creek National Park, southern Belize. The field survey mapping yielded over 149 wooden
architectural posts preserved below the sea floor in mangrove peat. The presence of
briquetage indicates the wooden architecture is associated with the infrastructure
associated with production and distribution of salt. The spatial distribution of the wooden
posts reveals evidence of structures associated with salt production along the coast in
southern Belize produced and distributed for the Late Classic Maya.

[31] The Carrapato Archaeological Site zoning
The Carrapato archaeological site is located in the Central Plateau of Brazil. This site was
divided into five zones. This zoning was done using information from satellite images,
analyses of thematic maps, field reconnaissance and pits drilling along the north/south and
east/west directions, allowing the field team to identify the natural and anthropic processes
that occurred in the area. Based on these procedures research has advanced regarding on
the understand of the horizontal and vertical distributions of cultural evidence as well as the
influence of the natural and anthropic processes in the formation of the archaeological site.

[105] Travel and Culture of the Plateau Culture Area
Transportation mirrored and influenced several facets of the Plateau Culture Area. Modes,
such as canoes, horses, and snowshoes, influenced trade routes, inter-group interaction,
and activities. They affected speed, ability to transport items, and distance of travel.
However, the environment bounded their routes. After the horse's arrival, people who lived
in navigable water-rich areas continued to canoe frequently. Conversely, landlocked groups
adopted the horse. The horse's increased range allowed groups to associate with a wider
variety of cultures, affecting their own. The horse's altered route, however, also led to
diminish contacts with earlier associates.

[158] Earthworks or Waterworks: Contextualizing the Great Tikal Ditch
Here we present a hypothesis suggesting that the “Great Earthworks” of Tikal had a
primary function as a linked series of limestone filtration trenches designed to collect and
direct infiltrating precipitation rather than as an extensive uniform defensive feature.
Several characteristics of the earthwork, including its aspect on slopes, the common and
variant morphologies of the ditch, and the overall topographical situation of the earthwork,
are explained in terms of their function as a hydraulic construction. Furthermore, we place
the earthwork within a context of other hydraulic constructions in both the acropolis and the
hinterlands of Tikal.

[258] Early Mississippian Cave Art from 12th Unnamed Cave, Tennessee
12th Unnamed Cave is a small Tennessee karst cavity that contains the richest
assemblage of prehistoric cave art (nearly 400 images) anywhere east of the Mississippi
River. The art is dominated by human and avian images. Abstract signs, serpents, and
human/avian transformations are numerous. Mud glyphs are present in a deeper stream
passage that may or may not relate to the petroglyphs. Detailed mapping of the cave walls
shows that the glyphs form a large composition focused on a deep pit in the back of the
decorated passageways. A series of C14 dates indicate use during the Early Mississippian

[69] Until the Cows Come Home.....
Early Neolithic cattle have recently been documented in Cyprus. This is significant because
they: had not previously occurred until the Bronze Age, disappeared later in the Neolithic,
represent some of the earliest likely domesticated cattle, and inform us of processes in
colonizing under-inhabited landscapes. This is a perplexing case of both incorporation and
subsequent abandonment of an important species. We are addressing cattle’s role in an
Early Holocene diversification and intensification strategy that contrasts with the island’s
earliest inhabitants, who likely overhunted endemic pygmy hippopotamus into extinction.

[248] Technological Persistence and Change in Postclassic Period Maya Metallurgy
The advent of metallurgy in the Maya area followed millennia of stone tool and ornament
production. Other materials, such as shell and bone, were also used by the Maya as tools
and as social symbols. While it appears that metal never fully replaced these materials for
either utilitarian or non-utilitarian purposes, metallurgy nevertheless appears to have been
embraced as a viable technology by a number of Maya. This paper explores persistence
and change in Maya metallurgy with an emphasis on technological and stylistic variation
across both the Lowland and Highland areas during Postclassic times (ca. AD 1000-1500).

results of phytolith analysis, which remains were extracted from sediments representing
1500 years of continuous occupation at the residential site of Kiuic. The study of phytoliths

Humans use animals to define themselves, others, and the Other. What remains less clear,
however, is how these cognitive perspectives on human/animal interaction impact our
understanding of herd management and the pragmatics of fostering herd reproduction in a
particular environment. This paper takes Ireland after the Norman invasion (12th century)
as a case study for the roles animal management plays in colonial encounters.

[257] From Chak Can to Gaspar Antonio Xiu: Literary Forms and Secret Knowledge in
Maya courtly communities
While scholars have long recognized the intellectual and cultural prominence of Classic
period non-royal elites, we have gained little insight into how they specifically manipulated
political discourse and knowledge production. In this paper, we build upon Marc Zender’s
recent epigraphic elucidation of non-royal elites by examining their contributions to the
continuities evidenced in Maya cosmogonic narratives and access-restricting riddles. We
expand the analytical lens by considering the narrative structure of several inscriptions from
Classic period Palenque and their resonance with late Postclassic Yukatek traditions as
represented in transcribed colonial texts, such as the Chilam Balam of Chumayel.

[144] The Possible Conceptual Basis of Settlement Boundary Definition at the Ancient
Maya Site of T’isil
Mapping at the Late Preclassic/Early Classic Maya site of T’isil in northern Quintana Roo,
Mexico, has revealed a settlement density that is among the highest in the Maya Lowlands.
While including a total area of less than two square kilometers, the settlement density
approaches 900 structures per square kilometer. Boundary definition at the site is more
distinct than usual, and seems to be bounded by a cosmogram with cenotes (karstic
sinkholes) marking the center and four corners of the site. One of these corner cenotes
appears to be an artificially constructed feature.

[111] Environmental Reconstructions at the Ash Creek Site near Payson, Arizona
Data recovery efforts at the Ash Creek site near Payson, Arizona, revealed the presence of
a suite of archaeological features ranging in time from approximately 1,500 B.C. to the
Historic period. An environmental reconstruction reveals that geomorphological and
hydrological processes extensively shaped the character of the landscape during this time
span, and may have created a persistent water source. Significantly, preliminary site
interpretations developed prior to the landscape reconstruction appear likely to be in error.
The geochronology of the Ash Creek site from the Archaic period through the Historic
period is presented in concert with other data, including the results of palynological and
phytolith analyses, as an environmental context for considering and plausibly interpreting
the archaeological remains at this small, but complex multicomponent site.

[85] Looting in Early Bronze Age Unetice Cemeteries
Early Bronze Age Unetice (ca. 2200-1700 B.C.) cemeteries in the Czech Republic are
frequently disturbed. The disturbances have been viewed as results of prehistoric looting
focused on metal artifacts. To test the looting hypothesis we focus on three large Unetice
cemeteries and approach the issue from the archaeological and bioarchaeological point of
view. We concentrate on the relationship between the burial disturbances and various kinds
of artifacts, skeletal preservation, corrosive stains on skeletons, and stratigraphy. Other
processes that might have been responsible for the disturbances are analyzed and their
contribution to the final pattern is discussed.

Peninsula
Although much research has focused on how and when some of the first humans entered
North America, clear-cut evidence for late Pleistocene and early Holocene long-distance
movement of people between northeast Asia and northwestern North America remains
elusive. Chemical sourcing studies of obsidian—a volcanic glass widely used by prehistoric
people to manufacture tools—may ultimately provide the evidence necessary to document
the movement of people between these regions. Here we provide an overview of recent
obsidian source studies in northeast Russia with a special focus on data generated for the

In order to address questions surrounding the nature of ancient Maya economic
organization, lithicists working in the area need to develop analytical approaches better
suited to the study of complex economies. This paper examines some baseline measures
for use in comparing the production of siliceous stone tools, both formal and expedient, at a
number of different scales. It emphasizes the need for standardization of a few basic
analytical statistics for comparative purposes, an appreciation of substitutability of the
various lithic materials and technologies found in Mesoamerica through integrated
analyses, and implementation of lithic-oriented research in the Classic Maya core regions.

DNA analysis was performed on a garment and sewn pouch associated with the Kwäday
Dän Ts’ínchi remains discovered on a glacier in Northwestern British Columbia. DNA was
successfully extracted from fur and sinew from a robe and pouch dating to at least 300BP.
Several animal species were identified, including arctic ground squirrel and American
beaver. The DNA data are useful for understanding how the textiles were constructed and
repaired, including species identities for both pelts and sinew. The DNA evidence may also
reveal valuable information on the geographic origins of the animals, providing insights on
ancient hunting or trading practices.

[310] Revisiting the Portraits of Palenque
This study examines Maya portraiture at Palenque during the Classic period. Using the
corpus of imagery from the site, I propose that portraits communicated information about
the identity of the sitter through the representation of the face and head. I argue that when
picturing the same person, sculptors rendered facial features with remarkable consistency.
The representation of features allowed the designers of visual programs to make specific
claims about the identity of sitters. I advocate that portraits communicate such claims, while
simultaneously reflecting and shaping the fragile political environment during this time
period.

[61] Middens at the Microscale: Micromorphology of Ancient Maya Trash Deposits
Micromorphology, the study of structurally intact sediments or soils, has been used to
investigate formation processes of various kinds of archaeological deposits at an extremely
fine-grained level. In this paper, I present the results of a study of midden deposits from the
Maya sites of Motul de San José and Trinidad de Nosotros in the Petén Department of
Guatemala. Standard archaeological investigation suggests that these middens resulted
from a variety of activities including feasting and general domestic disposal. Characteristics
visible at the microscale also suggest differences in formation processes and composition,
which in turn may be correlated to cultural phenomena.

[296] Hunting and Herding in Early and Middle Bronze Age Cyprus
Faunal evidence from the villages of Early and Middle Bronze Age Cyprus reveal hunting
and herding practiced in conjunction with one another for nearly 700 years. This study
interprets several faunal collections using models of hunting and herding strategies to
reconstruct the motivations behind this mixed faunal economy. These strategies balance
the production of meat and secondary products with the increased risk associated with
intensification and specialization. The evidence from the Cypriot Bronze Age serves as a
case study in the development of a secondary products economy, demonstrating that the
“secondary products revolution” need not be deterministically linked with the development
of urbanism.

Nasca Trophy Heads
This paper addresses Nasca trophy heads from both archaeological and iconographic

analyze the symbol within the Nasca sphere. My discussion of trophy heads considers their
appearance and deliberate preparation, elements that translate into the ceramic
iconography. Without attempting to recreate the action of trophy head taking, I unpack the
heads' symbolic purpose and suggest new possible meanings for their appearance in the
archaeological record. This study will show how the small, independent Nasca chiefdoms
interacted with other, like settlements through symbol, thus creating a recognizable culture.

[60] Lost in the Woods: The challenge of reconstructing past environments from pollen
records in a topographically complex region.
Reconstructing past environments provides context for interpreting the prehistoric record
and past behaviors. The Ridley Lake pollen record provides 14,000 years of vegetation and
climate history. Combined with other PNW lake sites and compared to wetland sites this
record illustrates the challenges of environmental reconstruction in a topographically
complex region. While the Ridley Lake record confirms general trends in climate and
vegetation change for the region, finer scale changes most applicable to the study of past
human behaviors are more difficult to reconstruct. Selecting an appropriate site is crucial
for successful joint paleoecological-archaeological studies.

A central debate in Andean archaeology is the extent to which maritime or agricultural

[224] Chronologies and Causes for the Late Pleistocene Megafauna Extinction in the New
World
Causes for the late Pleistocene extinction ca. 11,000 rcybp have been debated
unsuccessfully for decades. Key explanations lack accurate chronologies to test either
hypothesis. We present 200 new c14 dates as evidence that the extinction comprised two
events, 11,200-11,400 and 10,800-10,900. The first extinction included non-probosideans,
while the second included only mammoths and mastadons. The first extinction predates
Clovis, the second is contemporaneous with Clovis. The second extinction event coincides
with a hypothesized comet event at the beginning of the Younger Dryas. We conclude that
climate change was the key extinction cause, but humans contributed to the proboscidean
extinction.

[310] Reenacting Myth: Why Adults Pretend to Be Baby Birds
The Temple 21 platform at Palenque depicts five figures interacting ceremonially. In the
accompanying texts, the figures are identified, but the ceremony and the actions it entails
are not. Fortunately, by comparing the depiction on the platform to other depictions of the
same event, it is possible to demonstrate that the figures represented— the ruler, Pakal the
Great, two of his heirs, and their priestly attendants—are reenacting a mythic event
involving metamorphosis and bloodletting that has no counterpart in Colonial Maya
literature and is known only from Classic Maya works of art.

[59] Chibchan Mesoamerica, or Mesomerican Chibcha?: Drawing the Line in Greater
Nicoya
The archaeological subarea of Greater Nicoya was originally defined as incorporating the
“Mesoamericanised” portions of Pacific Nicaragua and Costa Rica’s Guanacaste-Nicoya
area. Yet while conquistadors described the region as “another Yucatan” and subsequent
explorers were eager to treat it as such, recent work suggests that Greater Nicoya is in
many ways as “Chibchan” as it is “Mesoamerican”. This paper will discuss shifting
perspectives on cultural affiliation in Greater Nicoya and the problems created by
approaching this area—and Mesoamerica in general—with an “either-or” mindset.

The Blood of the Ancestors Grotto (11SA557) has been interpreted as a rock art site likely

identifying boundaries between the sacred and the profane and behavioral pathways for
correct interaction/contact between the two. Some of these behaviors seem connected to
natural rhythms and periodicities. Descriptions of these rituals and their possible

[234] The Organization of Chipped Stone Tool Technology at Minanhá, Belize
Reduction sequences and spatial analysis for a variety of tool types of both chert and
obsidian allow for a more detailed reconstruction of the organization of lithic technology at
Minanhá. Based on an analysis of formal tools and production debitage, the Maya at this
site produced relatively few chert formal tools, relied on simple core reduction to produce
primarily chert flakes for expedient use and acquired obsidian prismatic blades from nearly
exhausted polyhedral cores. The lithic assemblage at this medium-sized border community
was heavily influenced by available stone resources with minimal sub-assemblage variation
associated with core/periphery or ceremonial/domestic context types.

[159] Stuck Between a Rock and Hard Place: Skill Transmission and Differential Raw
Material Use in Mesolithic Ireland
In Ireland, differential levels of skill were occasionally observed in Mesolithic stone tool
assemblages. To-date, this research has only concentrated on assemblages which
predominantly derive from the flint-rich north-eastern region of the island. The lithic
assemblages excavated from sites located in the South, West and Midlands are often
composed of a mixture of raw materials including volcanic rocks, or almost exclusively of a
fine-grained limestone. Two excavated assemblages, Ferriter’s Cove, Co. Kerry and
Derragh, Co. Longford, will serve as case studies for the exploration of the differential use
of raw materials during skill transmission in the flint-poor regions of Ireland.

[193] Technological Transitions and Cultural Evolution in Prehistoric California
The evolution of culture has long been described in terms of increasing complexity and
greater organization, but the details of how these changes played out with respect to
technology, rather than society, have been little explored. While differences in complexity
between bands, tribes, chiefdoms, or states are relatively straightforward, changes within a
hunter-gatherer level of adaptation are less obvious and less archaeologically visible.
Evidence from prehistoric California suggests technological change is often incremental
and shows regularities that may provide insights into how humans organize labor in the
face of increasing population and competition for resources.

Conventional hydration dating of Hawaiian volcanic glasses was attempted in the 1980s,
but the method was abandoned because of problems measuring the thickness of hydrated
surfaces on nearly opaque and relatively mafic glasses. Our attempt at potentially
resurrecting hydration dating in Hawaii employs a two-stage process. First we used EDXRF

intentionally created pit features. The impact of these observations on site interpretations

New excavations at Üçaðýzlý cave have yielded a detailed record of early Upper Paleolithic
(eUP) occupations on the Hatay coast of southern Turkey. The predominance of large
game and endscrapers, together with the microwear results, indicate that hunting and
multiple stages of hide processing were major activities throughout the formation of 11
cultural layers. Extensive de-fleshing of carcasses is suggested in the later eUP by
diagonal slicing marks and axial scrapes on upper limb bone shafts. The use of small
animals of all sorts stepped up suddenly with the onset of the eUP, in contrast to the local

[12] Hohokam Agave Production in the Phoenix Basin
While the last 15 years have witnessed a great deal of information on the cultivation of
agave in the Tucson area during the Hohokam Classic Period, its importance in the
Phoenix Basin heartland is less understood. We examine evidence for agave cultivation
and processing from previously recorded sites in the vicinity of the Hohokam canal systems
and recent discoveries of the ASU-City of Phoenix South Mountain Rock Art Project.
Information from features, artifacts, residues, and ethnographic data provide a framework
for understanding the ritual and economic importance of this plant during the Preclassic
and Classic Periods.

[4] Architecture and Intra-Village Dynamics: A Paleobotanical Analysis of Honey Bee
Village, A Northern Tucson Basin Hohokam Site
This research employs macrobotanical analysis to examine the underlying causes for the
construction of distinct architecture by the Hohokam during the Sedentary Period (A.D.
950-1150) at Honey Bee Village, Oro Valley, Arizona. This project analyzes flotation
samples taken from secure, pithouse contexts. In-migration, social differentiation, and
differences in ethnicity and function are all potential causes for differences in
contemporaneous structure construction. Analyzing plant resource use provides one line of
evidence for understanding village-level dynamics in a Sedentary Period Tucson Basin
Hohokam community.

[214] Breakage during Manufacturing and Use: Patterning on Hunting Implements from
Serendipity Shelter, Washoe County, Nevada
Many behavioral elements of culture are integrated into lithic production systems (e.g.,
mobility patterns, raw material procurement, trade, site use, task organization, etc.).
Serendipity Shelter, a strategically-located, archaic, short-term residential rockshelter with
pictographs in northern Nevada, provides an opportunity to examine several elements of a
complex lithic production system. This study, part of a long-term investigation at the
Shelter, focuses on breakage patterns on projectile points, and addresses how such
breakage might relate to raw material variability, style, and technology. Archaeological data
are compared to replicated breakage generated on points during experimental
manufacturing activities and in simulated hunting situations.

Agricultural yields in the northwest Yucatán are constrained by climate, thin soils, and low

required to supplement the food resources couldn’t have been produced at Chunchucmil
under traditional agricultural methods, or that agriculture was based on atypical crops

[172] Isotopic and Archaeological Evidence for Regional Ecological Differences in Pre-

Stable isotope analysis offers a direct way to investigate palaeoecology, and, by extension,
a means to better understand the ecological conditions within which hunter-fisher-gatherer
subsistence economies functioned. Isotopic analysis of faunal remains from a number of
late Holocene village sites in southern Haida Gwaii, combined with the results of more
traditional archaeological analyses, reflect regional variability in local food webs and
ecological conditions. This variability, in turn, provides insight into both the variable nature
of past subsistence practices and settlement patterns, and the temporal stability of these
patterns.

[218] Patterns of Missing Bone in Disturbed Burial Contexts
When human burials are looted or otherwise hastily disinterred, certain skeletal elements
are left behind at higher rates than others. This study presents a pattern of missing bones
observed in a sample of U.S. war dead burials from the Joint POW/MIA Accounting
Command. The sample includes burials with good skeletal preservation that were either
looted or disinterred and secondarily-buried. Several primary factors appear to dictate
which elements are left behind - element size (e.g. hands and feet), fragility (e.g. some
vertebrae, ribs, and cranial bones), and type of articulation (e.g. single rooted teeth, patella,
and hyoid).

[284] Interpreting the Meadowood Interaction Sphere: Religious cult, risk-buffering

In Northeastern North America, the Meadowood Interaction Sphere (3000-2400 BP) has
been interpreted alternately as a burial cult or a risk-buffering mechanism of regional
interaction. In contrast, I argue that the Meadowood Interaction Sphere may best be
explained by the development of socioeconomic inequalities and an attempt by a few
individuals or corporate groups to enhance their personal status and advantages through
privileged access to rare goods. This argument is based on the objects circulating in this
exchange network, the contexts in which they occur, the distribution of sites across the
landscape, and other characteristics of Meadowood communities.

[226] The Bronze Culture in the Ganjiang Valley and the Nature of Shang Expansion
One of hotly debated and unsolved issues in the investigation of early Bronze Age China is
the timing, extent, and nature of the expansion of Shang culture into the middle Yangzi
region. This paper discusses the rise and development of bronze-using societies in the
Ganjiang valley south of the middle Yangzi, and their relations with the Shang expansion.
We argue that the Shang expansion reached its maximum during the late phase of the
middle Shang instead of the Upper Erligang period. It is emphasized that both interregional
interaction and local agency should be considered in the study of the Shang expansion and
its impacted societies.

caso de la República Dominicana, el taino no fue el único poblador en contacto con los

estas diferencias cuando en el primer viaje las establece entre unos aborígenes del

[298] The Role of Salinization in the Decline of the Tiwanaku Raised Field Agricultural
System
The decline of the Tiwanaku state occurred during a time of environmental stress and
prolonged drought around A.D. 1150. This led to the view that Tiwanaku's collapse was
caused by the failure of the Tiwanaku raised field agricultural system due to prolonged
drought. We build on previous research by providing a multivariate explanation of how
raised fields and other agricultural systems in the Tiwanaku hinterland failed. We suggest
that salinization, brought on by a combination of natural and anthropogenic factors,
contributed to the failure of agricultural systems in the Titicaca Basin and led to Tiwanaku's
collapse.

energy deposits conducive to site preservation. Finally, fluvial landforms commonly
occupied just prior to and during the LGM can be buried beneath more than 9 m of

Several explanations for the pithouse to pueblo transition in the Mimbres area of New

group affiliation. Results suggest that Classic period mortuary behavior does not represent
a drastic departure from Pithouse period practices, but that it instead represents an

[28] MAP and Its Importance for the Local Community of Mosfellsbaer
The Mosfell Archaeological Project (MAP) has been in close collaboration with the town of
Mosfellsbaer from the start. The local authorities and MAP have cooperated around
research logistics and the use of research results. The community views the archaeological
research as important for the understanding and preservation of its local cultural heritage,
and a vital contribution to the study of Icelandic cultural and social history. The local interest
is based on the importance of the MAP’s holistic archaeological view, because such an
approach provides wider perspectives and possibilities in the presentation of the local
history for the public.

[96] The Emergence of Complex Metallurgy on the Iranian Plateau: Escaping the Levantine
Paradigm
The standard ‘sequence’ of metallurgical development in the Near East and the socio-
cultural behavior that is thought to accompany these stages are mainly based upon the
archaeo-metallurgical studies of the Levantine Chalcolithic. Early settlements of the Iranian
Plateau, where metal production was both complex and specialized by the 5th millennium,
demonstrate the problems of applying this ‘lowland’ model to all regions of the Middle East.
In this paper, I will synthesize the development of metallurgy on the Iranian Plateau,
focusing on the application of pyrotechnology and the social organization of craft
production, in order to propose a more highland-based model.

[97] Diet, Animal Use and Exchange: Zooarchaeological Evidence from Cancuén,
Guatemala
The Late/Terminal Classic period Maya site of Cancuén is located near the Petexbatún
region in southwestern Petén, Guatemala. Based on its location, Cancuén is thought to
have played a major role in highland-lowland trade and interaction. This paper will discuss
the zooarchaeological remains recovered from the site to assess the extent to which faunal
resources were integrated into the site’s highland-lowland trade system. Comparisons will
also be drawn between the site’s faunal assemblage and those of its likely trading partners
to assess regional variation in animal use and the nature of economic relations between
sites within the larger Petexbatún region.

[15] ‘We live well together’: sedentization, villageization and social capital in the north
European Iron Age.
During the Iron Age, a long, north European tradition of swiddening in dispersed, isolated
kin-based farms gave way to ‘villageization’ into sedentary, agglomerated non-kin
communities. Often attributed to some climate/demographic ‘push’, I instead explore ‘pull
factors’, as modern villageization is amongst the most disruptive and unwelcome of
strategic interventions. Villageization was likely interwoven with an emerging North Atlantic
mixed farming complex: pastoralism, byring, and manuring for cereal crops. Even voluntary
reorganization and establishment of new agroeconomies invoked significant social change,
as long-term, continuing investments of cooperative labor into landesque capital both
required and resulted in new types of social capital.

[24] Characterization of Replicated Yarns Toward Determining Spinning Technology from
Textile Fragments
Due to poor preservation conditions, textiles and textile technology are often under-
represented in the archaeological record. An experimental archaeological study of spinning
technology showed the feasibility of detecting production information from textile fragments.
Replicated yarns made by thigh-spinning and spindle-spinning were used to develop a
method to distinguish production activities by measuring properties of yarn structure in
archaeological specimens. Data collection during yarn replication and destructive testing of
the replicated yarns also yielded information about the socio-economic implications of
spinning technology choice and the serviceability of the yarns within textiles.

[291] Current and Future Agendas in Maya Bioarchaeology
Recent Maya research has increasingly incorporated information set forth by
bioarchaeological agendas. Here, we wish to outline the advances, pitfalls and challenges
met by the interdisciplinary biocultural research in this data-rich environment. We sketch
several lines of future integrated research and trace perspectives for coherent theoretical
frameworks These consent a much needed shift from bioarchaeology’s still predominant
role as a source of information and methodological (though highly sophisticated) tool, to a
truly interpretive and theoretical contribution, capable of canalizing the ample sources of
information into a unified approach in the reconstruction and interpretation of ancient life
ways and social change.

This paper discusses the methodology and results of an archaeological reassessment of a
contentious property in southern Ontario. The reassessment included re-survey of
agricultural fields and re-investigation of several archaeological sites. Methodologies
employed included backdirt screening and excavation of additional units on previously
excavated sites. The results of the reassessment did not replicate those achieved during
the original investigations, suggesting significant differences in archaeological practice and
artifact recovery rates between the two investigations. The paper proposes quality
assurance and monitoring measures that may be undertaken by CRM firms and regulatory
agencies to improve quality control in CRM.

Classic Maya Palace Complex
Ongoing research at the Early Classic palace complex of La Sufricaya sheds new light on
the internal and external political forces behind the foundation of Classic Maya ceremonial
centers. La Sufricaya represents a case of an Early Classic period foundation unusually
well documented by archaeological and epigraphic data. Despite its diminutive size and
proximity to the main ceremonial area of Holmul, this complex contains all the material
attributes of an independent political center: plazas, temples, a ball-court, a richly
decorated palace and inscribed monuments. The spatial analysis of these elements offers
further insights into their function.

[305] Finding Undisturbed Sites in Unexpected Places: Exploring the Archaic in the
Suburbs of Chicago
There has been much discussion over the differences between academic archaeology and
CRM archaeology. The advantage of academic research programs is the ability to focus on
long-term research goals. One advantage of CRM is that archaeologists frequently survey
areas that appear to have little potential for containing significant sites. Three such areas in
suburban Chicago have provided significant information on upland site use, lithic
manufacture and spatial organization in the Archaic. This paper demonstrates the potential
for such small sites to provide data on short-term base camps and resource extraction
camps in northeastern Illinois.

K’o is one of several medium-sized ceremonial centers surrounding the Classic Maya city
of Holmul, Guatemala. Ongoing research demonstrates that the site was occupied by a
sizeable population from the Late Preclassic through the Terminal Classic periods (300BC-

construction in the Preclassic period paralleled by a wide residential area. The relationships
of the ancient settlement with its ecosystem and with the nearby larger settlement of
Holmul is examined to inform about Maya shifting economic and power strategies during
the Preclassic to Classic transition.

enrich our contextualization of the oracle. Chronicles, histories, visitas pastorales, civil
actions, topographic maps, and even 20th century records of land sales have helped us to
understand the landscape associated with the oracle in the Incaic province of Huamachuco

The Wari presence in the Huamachuco area is not one of imperial control. The unfinished
site of Viracochapampa and a light scattering of Wari ceramics bespeak contact, but
temporal priority of niched halls at Marcahuamachuco with human bone incorporated into
the walls reverses the usually accepted direction of influence. The Wari presence in this
part of the north sierra is short lived and ambiguous and probably related to Wari
acquisition of prestige raw materials and finished goods. Northern patterns of ancestor
worship and associated architectural patterns were adopted and transmitted by Wari

[15] Population Reorganization and Socio-political Change in the South-Central Coast of

Traditionally, changes in the archaeological record of Puerto Rico were interpreted as
"natural" transitions from one culture to another. Later, variations in material culture through
time and space were explained by using resource/population imbalance models, which
served as an impetus for major socio-political re-arrangements. More recently, political
models replaced these ecological based models and as a result useful demographic and
environmental variables were discarded as relevant factors. In this paper we examine
trends in population and settlement patterns in the South-Central coast of Puerto Rico,
compare them with the resources available, and discuss potential socio-political processes
that may have produced them.

[138] From Sacred to Profane, From Illegal to Tradition: Prehispanic and Colonial Offerings
in the Cities of Puebla and Cholula
Offerings in the Mesoamerican worldview played an important role in the symbolic
construction of the world. Offerings were the material expression of a societal request for
protection, help, and above all, they expressed communication between the sacred and the
earthly levels of the humankind. The archaeological discoveries of offerings in Puebla and
Cholula provide insight on the symbolic meaning of the Mesoamerican worldview which
survived through the Colonial period as sacred spaces. This paper focuses on the symbolic
analysis of Prehispanic offerings associated with water and springs, as well as the ones
found associated to colonial buildings.

heavier degrees of reduction, 3) unifacial vs. bifacial flaking, 4) higher vs. lower quality raw
materials, 5) “primary” vs. “secondary” site context and 6) preferential removal and
transport of more useful artifacts. Results indicate that archaeologists need to assess these
variables in order to appreciate the patterning and significance of these early lithic
assemblages.

Ethno-historical accounts indicate that stands of economically important geophytes (roots

wildfires. Data from an experimental burn support this proposition. Here we discuss the

abundance, nutritional characteristics, and ease of collection of one traditionally important

others in the Northwest Territories for the Thule culture or the region of the Superior Lake,
was intensively used and exchanged. We can also see a definite continuity with the late

drier environment that characterizes cities. This has implications for understanding the
differential impact of parasites on the lives of urban and rural poor.

study investigates the distribution of black-on-white bowl diameters from the trash mounds
of Pueblo Bonito, the largest great house in Chaco Canyon. Distributions are unimodal not
bimodal, but there are many large-sized bowls, exceeding the mean diameter of whiteware
bowls from Pueblo Alto and indicating feasting.

[134] Performative Violence in the Wari Empire of the Peruvian Andes
Iconographic images of violence coupled with the display of human bodies and body parts
create and narrate stories of violence, and in the Wari empire of the ancient Andes, these
performative acts served to celebrate and perhaps normalize violent behaviors. As this
ideology was continually reified (as evidenced through head injuries and dismembered
bodies), these very actions recursively legitimated the performance and promotion of
aggression and violence. Thus, in this study, violent acts themselves are viewed as both
responsive to, and generative of, the factors that shape and condition violent behaviors.

[126] El Paso Brownware Temper Sourcing
A powerful tool in understanding ceramics in archaeology is the ability to source materials.
In El Paso Brownware, temper has yet to be fully addressed. Petrographic studies have
indicated granite as the temper material for El Paso Brownware, despite proximity to other
igneous formations common to the area (quartz monzonite, syenite). In this study we aim to
source the temper of ceramic vessels from the Jornada Mogollon pueblo by comparing the
temper to the mineral constituents of rock samples including quartz monzonite, Red Bluff
granite, and syenite, the three main igneous rock materials in the area.

Back-barrier islands- landforms of higher elevation located within tidal marshes between

research. On the coast of Georgia, most back-barrier islands have had no systematic,
intensive archaeological surveys, and the little research that has been done has focused on
shell-bearing sites. It is proposed that to understand how back-barrier islands fit into human

[204] Food Production and the Development of Elite Control in the Malpaso Valley
In semi-arid regions where agricultural land and water are not abundant, control of food
production resources and harvest are likely to be important foundations of elite power. This
paper distills the mounting botanical, geoarchaeological, chronological, and settlement
evidence to propose a model for food production in the Malpaso Valley of northern
Mesoamerica. Exploration into how people were provisioned addresses some important
and unresolved issues, such as the degree of elite control in the valley and the various
effects of climate change, human impacts, and interregional interactions on the
development of the short-lived, but intense Epi-Classic occupation.

The Scorpion site (LA 119530) consists of a dispersed Early Doña Ana phase (AD 1000-
1150) farming settlement established on the alluvial fan of the Sacramento Mountains in
the Tularosa Basin. Excavations suggest a growing intensification and increasing
specialization of agricultural production coupled with shifts in land use and residential
mobility during this little known period. Based on their shallow structures, limited storage
capacity; and low artifact frequencies, occupations probably did not continue into the colder
months. As such, the habitations probably represent seasonal farmsteads or hamlets
abandoned for more permanent winter villages after the harvest.

[274] Marked variation in subsistence at Machu Picchu, Peru revealed through stable
isotope analysis
This study explores recent hypotheses that the resident population at Machu Picchu, Peru
(AD1450~1570) was drawn from diverse backgrounds. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic
analyses from tooth dentine and enamel suggest substantial variation among the
population in diet during early life, pointing to variation in subsistence practices. In addition,
pathological conditions assessed against isotopic data suggest variation in exposure to
environmental and dietary stressors during early life. These results cast new light on the
demographic heterogeneity in this population, and the assumed social class of its
constituents. These results also provide new insights for interpreting skeletal pathology in
the Andes.

[202] Affluent Anarchy: Hunter-Gatherer Intensification in Northwestern California
While groups throughout the Pacific Northwest shared much in common, northwestern
California is rightly set apart as different from the “developed” or “core” area. Houses were
smaller, households were family (not corporate) based, polygyny was sororal (not outgroup
or alliance seeking), and redistributive ritual (e.g., potlatch) was absent. Centered on
individual property rights and money-use, the northwestern California system achieved
population densities and levels of affluence rivaling those of the classic Pacific Northwest,
but more cheaply, without the cumbersome and costly sociopolitical organization that
mobilized intensive production there. Clearly, organizational complexity is not a necessary
prerequisite for hunter-gatherer intensification.

[15] Why Jomon Shell Middens Disappeared: A Consideration of Cultural Changes in
Complex Foraging Societies
Large shell middens are a salient characteristic of Japanese Jomon foraging culture, which
lasted from 15,000 to 3000 BP. Middens were often accompanied by socio-political
indicators such as residential and burial pits. However, the generation of shell middens is
not a persistent phenomenon throughout the period, with middens disappearing from the
record anywhere within the Middle Phase and Final Phase (5500 to 3000 BP) in various
regions. Comparing shell midden disappearance between the eastern and western parts of
the Japanese islands, this paper discusses the implications of this process in relation to
societal changes in prehistoric foraging societies.

hindering spatial analysis. In the absence of preserved bone collagen, stable isotopes of

Salado religion reflects religious innovation by females aimed at mitigating this conflict.
Pottery, a significant female economic contribution, became the means of expressing the

The Puchteca had numerous priesthoods, but Quetzalcoatl was preeminent. Paquimé’s
redating demonstrated that it is too late to be founded by Toltecs, which in turn caused the
dismissal of DiPeso’s ideas regarding its religion. Newer schemes invoke everything from
priests to shamans to caciques, but they uniformly acknowledge the plumed serpent’s

traders and feather serpents) predates and postdates the Toltec and possesses flexibility in
its local expression. We consequently proposed that DiPeso’s ideas be reconsidered.

[198] Experimental Archaeology in Mollusk's Shell
Since 1997 in Templo Mayor Museum, Mexico City, an experimental archaeology project
has been developed which main goal is the knowledge of the techniques used to make
mollusk's shell objects in prehispanic Mexico. Until now more than 580 experiments have
been carried out and shell collections from different sites and temporalities have been
analyzed. The data obtained have been used to infer aspects of the specialization of
production of valuable items as well as to define technological styles. In the present paper
the methodology followed in the project and its main results are presented.

[279] A Ceramic Perspective on the Tuxtlas Postclassic
In this paper, I present ceramic evidence recovered during work at Postclassic Totogal in
the Tuxtla Mountains. External styles of elaborate ceramic decoration have been employed
successfully to identify evidence of Postclassic occupation in the Tuxtlas, but they are rare.
Undecorated ceramics, which are much more common, have not been distinguished from
Classic period materials. Using elaborate ceramic styles, along with radiocarbon evidence
and other period trends to date associated undecorated Postclassic ceramics, I
characterize the non-decorative attributes of the Postclassic ceramic assemblage. The
ability to identify Postclassic occupations through undecorated ceramics is important for
reconstructions of late Tuxteco prehistory.

[208] Paleosols as Genetic Stratigraphic Units
This paper examines the depositional and climatologic variables responsible for the
genesis of paleosols in North American alluvial contexts. The occurrence of
contemporaneous or penecontemporaneous paleosols in geographically separate drainage
basins indicates strong macro-climate controls on the fluvial hydrology and observed
alluvial stratigraphy. Given their circumscribed longevity and wide geographic occurrence,
the study of paleosols as genetic stratigraphic units can aid in predictive archaeology as
well as permit for regional paleoenvironmental reconstruction.

[49] Geophysical Investigation of a 18-19th century Fishing Village, Omey Island, Ireland
During the summer of 2007, archaeologists from the University of Notre Dame conducted
geophysical investigations on Omey Island. While more than 20 specific localities were
studied, some of the most interesting results came from a complex of structures attributed
to a 18-19th century fishing village. The geophysical field survey employed a RAMAC
ground penetrating radar using a shielded 500 MHz and 250 MHz antenna indexed with a
global positioning system. All information obtained was then run through GPR-slice for
analysis. It was found that ground penetrating radar was successful in identifying anomalies
that were determined to represent distinct cultural features.

[270] The Symbolic Signatures of the Dispersal Of Moderns: The Southern Arc
We will discuss symbolic behaviour as expressed in the archaeological record of the
dispersal of modern humans across the southern arc from Africa to Australia between
100,000 to 40,000 years ago. We will review the evidence for inter-group interactions and
identity markers, such as movement of goods imbued with high social value, ornaments,
art, ritual burial and use of arbitrary conventions in the making of artefacts. Alternative
explanations for the apparent dearth of symbolic material markers in the south will be
critiqued towards building a general model of information in the context of small-scale, but

[153] Marxism in Spanish Archaeology: paradigms and research models on the origins of
social complexity in Iberia
This paper presents a critical review of the dynamics of recent research on the origins of
social complexity in Iberia, based on the description of a dominant paradigm, whose
fundaments lie on Historical Materialism. Within this paradigm, two opposed models can be
identified after their diverging interpretations of the main theoretical categories implied in
the analysis. These models will be evaluated in relation to their potential to make sense of
the entirety of the Iberian social formations histories, from the Neolithic to the Iron Age, in a
broader framework than the cultural local contexts for which they were initially formulated.

Sixteenth century Spaniards identified numerous groups of Cahitan-speaking peoples

have traditionally been considered to be late (ca. 12th C.) arrivals displacing presumably
Tepiman-speaking peoples. The results of our recent investigations in northern Sinaloa and
southern Sonora, however, support long-term in situ cultural developments within the

geoarchaeological techniques unraveling its formation process
The dark bed that covers the great sambaqui site of Jabuticabeira II represents a shift in
the cultural deposition that substituted shells by sediments rich in archaeofaunistic remains,
charcoal and sand. Exploring the potential of geoarchaeology in the study of cultural
formation processes, sedimentology’s facies analysis was adapted to perform
archaeostratigraphic studies. Complete description and characterization was made of the
different archaeofacies that comprise the dark bed from their physical, chemical,
mineralogical and micromorphological point of view. Information derived from this analyses

Intensive geophysical and microtopographical surveys provide data for settlement structure

[139] When does the childhood end?
The goal of our presentation is to examine the problems associated with determining the
upper age limit of childhood in archaeological populations. Although the definition of
childhood is a culturally determined and varies greatly among groups, anthropologist
working in archaeological contexts often assume that childhood is biologically defined—
which may reflect a western cultural perspective. Consequently, bioarchaeologist typically
define “childhood” using skeletal parameters as age cut-off points, without reference to the
cultures they investigate. Here, we wish emphasize the importance of this problem and
suggest that bioarchaeologists contextualize the analyses of skeletal remains with
observed burial practices and material culture.

[217] Distributions of Age and Pathology of Juvenile Skeletons from the Kellis 2 Cemetery,
Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt: A GIS Analysis
Excavations in the Roman/Christian period Kellis 2 cemetery (circa 50 – 450AD), Dakhleh
Oasis, Egypt, have revealed a total 410 juvenile skeletons out of 645 individuals. This study
utilizes GIS to examine the placement of juvenile burials within the cemetery according to
age and pathology. Analysis of pathological conditions from a subsample of 180 juveniles
include dental pathology, developmental defects, cribra orbitalia, trauma (including
fractures and birth trauma), and periosteal reactions. GIS results indicate that certain
patterns are discernable in the burial location of juveniles according to their age and
pathological condition.

[104] The Cañada del Oro Valley Hohokam: Results of Large-Scale Excavations at Honey
Bee Village
Nestled at the confluence of two major tributary drainages, Honey Bee Village was a
moderately large prehistoric Hohokam ballcourt village in the Cañada del Oro Valley north
of Tucson, Arizona. A year of excavations in 2006-2007 resulted in a near-complete map
and very large excavated sample of the ancient village for the portions outside the central
precinct. With over 350 exposed structures ranging in age from A.D. 500 to 1200, a wide
range of research issues were addressed. This paper will examine changes in settlement
structure and the emergence of a distinct local identity.

[295] Echo Masks, Echo Myths, and Echoing Rock Art Sites of the Pacific Northwest
Echo masks of the Pacific Northwest are a mobilary art form that is a manifestation of
cultural beliefs in echo spirits. Much parietal rock art is also a manifestation of cultural
beliefs in echo spirits, suggests archaeoacoustic evidence. Echoes have been documented
at hundreds of rock art sites globally, including the Pacific Northwest. The animistic
paradigm of supernatural explanations for echoed sounds, documented in many echo
myths, can help explain motivations for both the location and subject matter of much rock
art. The natural acoustics of rock art environments should thus be preserved.

[281] Meat me in St. Louis: Irish Foodways and the Immigrant Experience in 19th century
St. Louis, Missouri
This paper explores Irish immigrant foodways in St Louis in the mid-nineteenth century. It is
based on a sample of faunal remains uncovered from a large-scale salvage excavation on
the former location of a working-class, multi-ethnic, immigrant neighborhood. The analysis
focuses on the species represented in the assemblage and the quality of the meat cuts to
explore the economic, social and cultural contexts of the households being studied. The
results demonstrate how food choice reveals the complex interactions between these
working-class immigrant families and the social and economic environment in which they
lived.

[204] Swahili Urbanization and Food Production: Paleoethnobotanical Contributions from
Pemba Island, Tanzania
From approximately AD 1000-1500, Swahili stonetowns emerged along the eastern African
coast as local farming communities engaged with the Indian Ocean world through material
and ideological exchange. Archaeologists have assumed that stonetown residents obtained
staple grains from the countryside and were not themselves primary food producers. I test
these assumptions, gleaned largely from ethnohistoric sources, directly against the
archaeological record in this first comprehensive study of ancient Swahili plant foods.
Significantly, stonetown households at Chwaka (Pemba) continued to store their own
supplies of grains (rice) and textile plants (cotton) during urbanization, and were likely not
externally provisioned.

[40] Archaeologies of Disenchantment
A central challenge facing archaeologists in Africa is addressing contemporary
communities. Two scholarly trends flourish in African heritage studies: giving “voice” to
silenced pasts and the search for relevancy in practice. Archaeologists remain in a certain
mode of expression that hinders the resolution of these conundrums. I posit that our
disenchantment results from a failure to engage and translate expressions of discontent
among the people whose pasts we study. The history making potential found in everyday
struggles, atypical happenings, and fantastic renderings in Tanzania valorizes such
disenchantments and offers archaeologists opportunities to begin to resolve their search for
relevancy.

[226] Interregional Interaction and the Formation of Early Chinese Civilization
Interregional interaction is one of the most crucial social and cultural processes shaping the
formation and working of early Chinese civilization. This paper charts temporal and spatial
variations of interregional interaction the Central Plain had with its neighboring regions from
the Neolithic to Bronze Ages. It is argued that the territorial extent of early China was
largely determined by the cycling of expansion and retreat of regional Neolithic cultures.
Ideology, manifest in the rituals, was a core element of the cultural expansion out of the
Central Plain, and it was also the foundation of integrated and multifaceted early Chinese
civilization.

Core technologies in the Jornada region of the southern Southwest are often viewed as

different levels, and that some “expedience” may have involved a greater degree of
planning and design. In this paper, using datasets based on projects across the Fort Bliss
military reservation, we will examine the organization of production and the question of
whether production was in fact planned toward the deliberate selection of flakes for
anticipated tasks or whether it was purely expedient, focused instead on the manufacture of
unstandardized flakes for multiple or undifferentiated tasks.

[83] Social Memory, Cultural Archaism, and the Politics of Spatial Production: The
Compounds of Jatanca, Peru
Architectural configurations and settlement patterns are the result of numerous short and

cultural archaism are among the prominent factors that ultimately inform the configuration
of the constructed environment. This paper will examine the dynamic role played by these
various factors in the formation of the proto-urban Peruvian North Coast site of Jatanca.
Ultimately, this largely Gallinazo site provides an excellent opportunity to analyze the
degree to which the above factors – especially cultural archaism and social memory –

[265] Structure and Formation of the Early Paleoindian Layer at the Helen Lookingbill Site
in Northwestern Wyoming.
The Helen Lookingbill site (48FR308) is located in the Washakie Range of the Absaroka
Mountains in northwestern Wyoming. A 10,400 year old Early Paleoindian layer at the site
yielded a rich chipped stone assemblage that originally received minimal reporting. The
focus of this study is the structure and formation processes of the chipped stone
assemblage. The research is based on several analytical methods, including refitting,
attribute analysis, and cluster analysis. The results indicate that during the Early
Paleoindian Period the site was predominantly utilized for biface production, which likely
occurred around a hearth. The Early Paleoindian chipped stone component was
moderately affected by several post-depositional processes and most of the site remains
spatially intact.

This paper examines the quintessential architectural form of Iroquoia - the longhouse - from

symbolic representation in favour of exploring how this built form might have been
apprehended and experienced by its inhabitants. Along these lines, modes of Iroquoian
sociality are explored with regard to lived space and the notion that the longhouse would
have been differentially disclosed to the senses. Ultimately, in arguing for a continuous
rather than binary view of the Iroquoian world, this paper foregrounds the potential for a
human/home co-agency and mutual becoming.

The British Empire imagined itself as an extensive global template, each territory roughly
analogous to another and all governed with legal-rational consistency. However,
archaeological reconstructions of the late 19th century Diamond Fields in South Africa
contradict this vision. Speculation, smuggling, and gambling made such spaces antithetical
to racial and class-based imperial systems, and represented the point at which the colonial
empire confronted the radical social effects of global finance capital. Disciplining this
heterogeneity, by asserting strict racial and class distinctions that had been blurred by the

[16] Cultivated Landscapes as Inalienable Wealth in Ancient Mesoamerica
It is well established that many ancient Mesoamerican peoples perceived cultivated
landscapes as animate, that is, inhabited and controlled by ancestors who demand
supplication and recompense. Agricultural decision making within this worldview was
therefore subject to the inalienability of productive land: to keep (use-rights to the land) one
must give (products of the land). Through an archaeological and ethnopedological
examination of how Maya and Nahua groups classified and conceived of soil and land, I
argue that cultivated landscapes were a form of inalienable wealth, whose strategic
“circulation” could have provided an ideological—and sometimes practical—basis for
hierarchy in community social relations.

imagery can be associated with the highly repetitive scenes found on Terminal Classic
period Pabellon Molded-Carved ceramics, which were distributed across the Maya region.
This paper will address the surprising continuity in Pabellon imagery while demonstrating
the existence of widespread social networks during a time when the Maya region is thought
to develop more regionalized, isolated identities.

[13] Excavating between the Lines: Textual Silences and Missionary Archaeology in the
Colca Valley, Peru
Understanding of early missionary encounters in the Andes has been hindered by scanty
coeval documentation and archaeological research. Ecclesiastical memorials of early
evangelical campaigns generally extol triumphalist narratives of mass conversion and
extirpation that are suspect, given demographic imbalances between clerics and
indigenous populations, and cultural differences inherent to early contact situations. This
presentation reviews such representations in memorials of the initial Franciscan presence
in the Collagua province of southern Peru, and compares them to excavation findings from
a chapel at an early mission there. Architectural and mortuary evidence suggest
accommodationist compromises and hybrid practices not evident in ecclesiastical accounts.

[299] A Traditional Navajo Approach in Conducting Archaeological Investigations on the
Reservation
The focus will be a discussion on traditional Navajo thought processes coinciding with
archaeological methods. The philosophical concepts borrowed from Navajo philosophy will
be the topic of discussion and ways it can merge with archaeological investigations. These
concepts of Navajo philosophy are Nitsahakees, Nahat’a, Iina, and Siihasiin. Four concepts
that convey the cyclical thought process of traditional Navajo people. These Navajo
concepts mirror the scientific thought process for Navajo students to grasp a scientific and
holistic picture of the archaeological record. In the end it provides a framework for Navajo
archaeology students in effort to best preserve their cultural heritage.

[139] Sambaquis: A Brazilian Myth Of Well Succeeded Foragers?
More than 1.000 Brazilian sambaquis, up to 400m long/30m high, are concentrated around
shallow salt waters preserving hundreds of burials, artifacts, vertebrate and invertebrate
remains. They are dated from 8.000 to 1.500 ybp. Hegemonic interpretation consider them
forager´s settlements and/or funeral monuments, a testimony of a well succeeded lifestyle.
Recent studies on archaeology, zooarchaeology, bioarchaeology, nutrition and
demography bring new prehistoric interpretation. Archaeological visibility and skeletal
preservation strongly contribute to the idea of big populations. New nutritional datum
contribute to rethink the concept of foragers living on molusc. New models help to explain
lifestyle and time and space persistence.

[60] The Archaeology of Paleoshoreline Sites on the Northwestern Olympic Peninsula
Archaeological sites in forest settings on the northwestern Olympic Peninsula appear to be
associated with an earlier sea level stand and suggest that marine bays were present in
what are now coastal river valleys. Most of the sites contain both shell midden deposits and
overlying non-shell cultural deposits that are rich in chipped stone artifacts. Radiocarbon
dates indicate that they represent occupations between approximately 4,500 and 1,500
years ago. The shell midden deposits in these sites are dominated by marine resources,
including whales, and show that a sophisticated maritime culture has been present here for
at least several millennia.

of the sites date to the Pueblo I period (A.D. 750-900). Analysis of ground stone artifacts
was conducted to quantify the relative importance of maize agriculture in the subsistence
strategies employed by the Pueblo I-period inhabitants of the project area. Preliminary

Ocean. Stable isotope analysis and zooarchaeological remains collected from Alaska’s
Kodiak Island are used to test the idea that prehistoric people adapted the fishery to
accommodate climate change and resource fluctuation.

[235] Mapping submerged coastlines: Postglacial sea-level history and the reconstruction
and assessment of Newfoundland’s coastal archaeological heritage
Holocene relative sea-level (RSL) change on Newfoundland has been spatially and
temporally complex, involving coastal submergence and emergence at different periods.
Consequently, many coastal areas favoured by its earliest inhabitants - the Maritime
Archaic Indians – now lie underwater. This paper will demonstrate how the changing
spatio-temporal distribution of these critical environments can be reconstructed using a
combination of existing field observations and geophysical models. This allows areas of
high archaeological potential to be pinpointed and targeted for subsequent survey, while
the refined knowledge of RSL trends allows assessment of the vulnerability of coastal
archaeological sites to future sea-level rise.

of the center to impulses coming from the outside, whether from northwestern

see the rise of the center as due to local impulses. None deny the importance of
Mesoamerican contacts, but this paper evaluates the role that they played in the rise of

[270] Style as Stored Information
It is well known that style in items of material culture encapsulates and conveys information
of various sorts. Two of the common levels of such information are individual identification
and expression of group affiliation. In this paper, it is argued that in small-scale, hunter-
gatherer bands material culture style primarily expresses individual identity, and reflects
regional social connections and networks. Thus, a band’s material culture captures and
stores recent group history. In contrast, style in the material culture of more larger-scale
societies primarily reflects group identities and marks boundaries. The contrast is illustrated
with ethnographic examples and data.

suggest that the use of foreigners or “the other” as political tools does not constitute
sacrifice. We also explore the possibility that, for both warriors and commoners, attempts
were made to transform “the other” to “us” before execution, and its meaning for sacrifice.

[96] Southeast Asian Early Bronze Metallurgy: A Complex Technological System in a
Heterarchical Social Context
Appearing in northeast Thailand about 2000 BC, early Southeast Asia bronze metallurgy
challenges conventional expectations for the socio-economic significance of this
technology. The very complexity of bronze technology inherently qualifies it as a "complex
technological system," yet the social context in which the early technology took root and
initially flourished was not overtly stratified. Activities necessary to maintain this technology
took place in decentralized arenas, via household production and some specialized
production communities. The abundance of regional copper and tin resources may help
explain the early development of bronze technological competency in Southeast Asian non-
stratified societies.

Following Inuit colonization of Labrador in the fifteenth century, the winter dwelling passed
through a series of reorganizations that reflect, in part, accommodations to the changing

Although the emergence of large multifamily dwellings has attracted the most

household labor organization that implicates a range of spatial settings beyond the iglu.
The wider context of Inuit lives, from village play to roaming the land, needs to be drawn

[154] Simple Tools, Complex Concepts: Mobility and Ethnicity in the SW
In the past thirty years lithic archaeology has progressed from considerations of typology
and function to addressing social and even symbolic reconstructions. One central
interpretive concern is the degree of settlement mobility shown by a population. A second
interest is in tracking the movement and interactions of ethnic groups using artifacts seen
as regionally, and perhaps symbolically, distinctive. Our material from several Sinagua sites
around Flagstaff, Arizona, suggests that both these issues are too often treated
simplistically. The argument that mobile people are more likely to make formal tools while
sedentary folk prefer ad hoc equipment seems particularly rife with definitional problems
and overgeneralization, while issues of ethnic style identification are muddled by functional,
technological, and material variability as well as the difficulty of deciding whether artifacts,
people, or both are moving.

archaeologists. A collaborative project between the Pueblo of Cochiti and UPenn provided
the context for new research questions to be explored. Is the post-contact period best
understood as the beginning of the end for the Pueblos (as many contact period narratives
suggest)? Are these "Terminal Narratives" appropriate? Or do collaborative methods
require and generate narratives of continuity, linking the Pueblos to an ancestral material
landscape? Archaeological and historical narratives of contact and change are challenged
through collaborative methods and an emergent Indigenous archaeology.

[222] The Animas-La Plata Project: Lab Management from the Field to Curation
This poster outlines the processes used to manage the materials recovered from the
Animas-La Plata project, a large excavation project in Southwestern Colorado involving
hundreds of thousands of artifacts and samples. The poster describes how artifacts and
samples were documented in the field, entered into the lab system, tracked before and
after analysis, and prepared for outsourcing. One challenge of a large project is building a
system to effectively manage artifacts in a manner that can accommodate each analyst and
the research questions. This poster demonstrates how this task was accomplished and
how collections are being prepared for curation.

[264] Reflections in the Landscape: Norse Identity in Greenland
Norse settlers inhabited colonies in Greenland for roughly the first half of the last
millennium. Ways in which features of Norse Greenlandic society were represented in the
physical landscape are explored through GIS spatial analysis; these include the function of
fjords as parish boundaries and distribution of quality pasturelands. Layers of power appear
to resonate at the church sites, especially the seat of the episcopal bishop at Gardar.
Examination of burial patterns demonstrates that settlers themselves played an active role
in creating this power. The overwhelming power of this place led in part to the collapse of
the Norse colonies.

[48] Metallurgical Provenance Study: Transition from Bronze Age to Iron Age in Northern
Europe
Throughout the Bronze Age elites of northern Europe had power over bronzesmiths by
limiting resource availability, such as tin, which was likely transported from England. With
the development of iron technology, smiths had some autonomy from elites since iron was
found locally. Without elite control, ironsmiths experienced more social and political
freedom. Using a TIMS to determine lead isotope ratios in pre-Roman bronze and iron
objects from Nijmegen, Netherlands, will locate the raw materials source. Distance of the
raw materials from the find site will help exemplify this Iron Age transition from elite
controlled bronzesmith to a more autonomous ironsmith.

[290] The Navigation of Landscapes, the Construction of Subjects, and the Reproduction of
Society
In this paper we explore how the patterned movement of individuals through landscapes
contributes to the construction of subjects and the reproduction of society. Building from
Ingold’s discussion of the acquisition of skill through material engagement, we extend the
notion of skill to encompass cultural competence generally, otherwise viewed as the set of
more-or-less normative dispositions that lead individuals to act in culturally explicable ways.
In doing so, we relate “ways of moving” to “ways of being”, and we consider the potential
contributions of archaeological studies of movement to practice theory, broadly conceived.

[97] Ancient Maya Sociopolitics and Community-Building at Chau Hiix
Investigations at the Maya site of Chau Hiix suggest strategic use of ritual in the Terminal
Classic as a sociopolitical strategy as indicated by a dense collection of archaeological
materials on the site’s main platform. This paper describes Feature X02—an elaborate and
intentional deposit at Chau Hiix—while considering the range of possible activities
responsible for the concentration of materials. The importance of the deposit lies in the
information it provides about community interactions during the tumultuous Terminal
Classic, and why Chau Hiix remained cohesive while other lowland Maya centers
experienced great change and disuse following the Later Classic period.

[243] Clam Gardens: Aboriginal Mariculture on Canada's West Coast
Information from Klahoose elder Elizabeth Harry prompted a 1993 exploration of rock
walled terraces constructed for the cultivation of butter clams in Waiatt Bay, Quadra Island.
The multiple clam gardens observed prompted the proposition that Waiatt structures, and
similar Broughton Archipelago terraces, constituted a form of aboriginal mariculture. The
technology allowed enhanced recruitment of specific clams that were a crucial dietary
component for some native groups. The extent of clam garden usage suggests some butter
clam residue dominating shell middens in coastal sites was a product of deliberate
enhancement of extreme low-tide shellfish habitat.

[217] Unusual Modes of Production: The Seasonal Birthing Cycle of Women from Kellis 2
Cemetery (50-450AD), Dakhleh Oasis, Egypt
Ancient epigraphic sources have provided sparse evidence of seasonal birthing cycles for
populations of the Roman Empire as few sources provide large numbers of birth records.
Excellent preservation and sample size of the Kellis 2 cemetery population allowed for
detailed analyses of seasonal cycles in infant birth and mortality and mortality patterns in
birthing age women. Comparative analyses indicate patterns of infant birth and mortality
that are opposite to the rest of the Mediterranean. In addition, seasonal mortality of infants
and women is directly associated with the birth cycle and affects the seasonal amplitude in
mortality patterns of the population.

historical mass disaster
Historical accounts of well-documented disasters have tremendous potential to increase
our understanding of how those events affected past communities. Using historical records
and victims’ lists, this project examines the Johnstown Flood of 1889 and its signature on
the local community. In particular this study focuses on the recovery, demographics, and
funerary treatment of the victims. Over 2200 individuals perished in what was considered
the worst U.S. disaster of the 19th century. These victims were more likely to be women
and children, and the recovery and eventual burial of their bodies proceeded rapidly and
systematically, especially considering the degree of destruction.

Mitochondrial DNA haplogroup frequencies were constructed from two ancient Peruvian
populations, Kilometer 4 and Chiribaya Alta, from the coastal Osmore valley. These results
were then compared with published mtDNA haplogroup frequencies from 29 ancient and
modern South American populations. Our data suggests population continuity through time
in the Osmore Valley. Our two samples are similar to each other in genetic composition and
do not significantly differ from a Middle Horizon Osmore mid-valley sample. These results
differ from a recent study of northern Chilean samples that suggested population change
with possible population replacement there.

[88] A GIS-Based Simulation of Colonial Resettlement and Terrace Abandonment in the
Colca Valley, Peru
This poster examines the effects of forced resettlement on patterns of colonial-era
agricultural de-intensification. Situated in the Colca Valley of southern Peru, this analysis
employs LCP-based walking simulations to and from agricultural fields declared in colonial
Spanish administrative documents. The walking simulation results indicate that patterns of
terrace abandonment are partially explained as a function of distance, but also suggest
how resettlement disproportionately affected lower-ranking kindreds in a local dualistic
political structure. By extension, we suggest that the observed patterns of abandonment
were a legacy of finely-attuned negotiations that influenced the emplacement of colonial
villages in the Andean landscape.

[13] Social tension in Northwest Argentina ca. 1000- 1536 d.C
Currently, anthropologists, archaeologists, and historians are debating how social patterns
that reflect violence can be studied in societies. It is likely that Inca society was one of the
states with ampler military knowledge and a significant war history. Spanish written records
describe a warlike situation before the Inca Empire emerged, in which fights for regional
dominion among local leaders were pervasive. Even though, few archaeological
investigations have provided material evidence to study those rebellions. We intend to
contribute to the understanding of this process providing archaeological and ethnohistorical
data prior to the incorporation of northwest Argentina into the Inka Empire.

Archaeologists working on California’s Channel Islands have emphasized the importance of
human subsistence activities, along with climate change, in structuring prehistoric
nearshore marine ecosystems. We report faunal data from three Middle Holocene midden
deposits, including two dominated by red abalone and another by sea urchins and
California mussels, at CA-SMI-161 on San Miguel Island. Differences in the relative
abundance of various shellfish taxa appear to be related to human predation pressure and
possibly changes in sea surface temperature. These data enhance our understanding of
the role of ancient peoples in influencing and impacting ancient Pacific Coast marine
ecosystems.

[307] Chipped Stone and a Splitting Headache: Understanding behavior using a lithic
assemblage lacking cultural chronology markers from southeastern Iowa
Prehistoric use of areas rich in lithic raw materials can promote convoluted collections of
lithic technological traditions. Assessing “plow zone” lithic assemblages with few
chronologically sensitive artifacts in such areas can make it difficult to understand
landscape and site use through time. This paper explores these problems using a lithic
assemblage from southeastern Iowa. The scatter is metrically and macroscopically
analyzed and compared to lithic artifacts from recorded sites in the region. Probabilities are
drawn between similar landscapes with recorded sites in the area to support probable
settlement types and cultural traditions within a chaîne opératoire framework.

William Irving defined the Arctic Small Tool tradition in 1964 based largely on the Punyik
Point site in the Brooks Range. Fourteen years prior he excavated at Imaigenik (49-XCL-

hearth. The site is likely to have been influential in Irving's conceptualization of the ASTt,
but because the term had not yet been coined and little was ever published on the site,
Imaigenik is rarely referenced. Reanalysis of the site stands to secure Imaigenik’s place as
an archaeologically and historically significant ASTt site.

The regional political stability engendered by the emergence of the Cahokia polity was
punctuated by brutal episodes of ritual killings. The Mississippianization of Cahokia’s
northern frontier was marked by small-scale migrations and the establishment of various
Mississippian “outposts” throughout the northern Midcontinent. Incidences of Cahokian-
style ritual killings correspond with the establishment of several of these “outposts”
indicating that the appropriation of certain kinds of ritualized violence was an important
dimension to the processes of Mississippianization along the northern Mississippian
frontier.

indices of phytoliths as evidence for burning, but no concrete claims can be made unless
the effects of fire upon phytoliths are rigorously quantified. This poster presents the findings
of a study into the effects of combustion on phytoliths. I identify several distinctive patterns
and outline a preliminary model for quantifying the impact fire has had upon a phytolith
assemblage.

Emergent lands appeared between 12.0 and 10.0 14C ka around the San Juan Islands,
Washington, when isostatic rebound exceeded eustatic sea-level rise. While not a land
bridge, this was a biogeographic filter corridor. Orcas Island megafauna included bison and
ground sloth, and bison also reached southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia, by 11.8
ka, occupying open pine forest or parklands. Mountain goats were also on Vancouver
Island before 12.0 ka. This situation lasted into the time when people, likely big-game
hunters, were in the region. New data are presented concerning vertebrate fauna, relative
sea levels, and 14C chronology.

The determination of ancient agricultural potential across the landscape is important in

rainfall patterns and localized topographic variation. Through the incorporation of climatic
data, soil assessment, and high-resolution topographic data, potential temporally-
differentiated seasonal exploitation of the landscape can be determined. The identification
of the seasonal agricultural availability of different portions of the Mixtequilla Survey Region

[268] Hybridization in the first millennium AD Europe: a view from the Roman Empire
The Roman Empire survived for centuries not because of a brutally imposed imperialism
but because of remarkable tolerance towards indigenous social, economic and religious
structures. The interaction between Rome and its peoples resulted in cultural hybridization,
reflected in such labels as Romano-African, Gallo-Roman and Romano-British. This paper
takes two areas, Sicily and Britain, and examines factors which led to hybridization in each
case – including the character of pre-Roman society, the role of the army, economic
considerations, indigenous cultural resistance, and the degree of outside ‘intervention’.
There can be no one model, so multi-variant is hybridization in the Roman Empire.

[114] GIS Spatial Analysis of Late Prehistoric Cahuilla Land Use and Post-Contact
Influence on Traditional Settlement and Subsistence Patterns
The Cahuilla of Southern California first experienced European contact in the mid 1770s.
Less affected by missionization than other tribes, the Cahuilla were nonetheless influenced
by non-native settlement throughout the remainder of California’s Spanish, Mexican and
American periods. Since 1900, the Cahuilla have been the subject of substantial
ethnographic and ethnobotanical research and numerous archaeological sites within their
traditional territory have been documented. Few studies, however, have focused on
reconstructing broader settlement patterns. This paper uses GIS to synthesize
archeological and archival data, producing spatial analyses of pre- and post-contact
Cahuilla land use and examining changes in occupancy patterns.

the correlation of artifacts (i.e. projectile points or chips) with the sources (i.e. quarries) of
the raw material. A review of the instrument and analytic processing is presented along with
examples of the use of the system for material identification.

likely signified that these items were bundled when not in use. Such schematic depictions
add to our knowledge of the iconic conventions used to represent bundling practices of the

As a result of cold temperatures, Arctic archaeologists often encounter substantial

This house yielded an apparently "complete" assemblage of well-preserved, intact artifacts,
resulting from the house’s abandonment after the death of the occupants. This assemblage

[314] Ritual, Power, and Supernatural Associations in the Pasión-Verapaz Region,

According to Kertzer (1988), political systems exploit preexisting ritual and symbols to
increase their own power. In Hawaii, the rulers used symbols that “stood for” and
associated themselves with gods and were the only members of the community with
access to god houses. Here, as in Mesoamerica, ritual serves the dual function of
associating the rulers to the divine and restricting access to it. This paper is based on
seven years of investigation in sacred sites in central Guatemala and will focus on how the
local elite restricted access to and associated themselves with the supernatural world.

aspects of specific production sequences. This presentation will examine how outdated
paradigms have structured recent attempts to identify blades as far back as the Middle

advantages of core/blade technology before they can effectively develop methodologies for

[259] Geoarchaeology And Pleistocene Environmental Change: A Mediterranean
Perspective On Progress And Prospects
This paper reviews recent advances in the study of Pleistocene environmental change in
the Mediterranean and outlines the problems involved in attempting to compare these data
with the archaeological record. Rockshelters and caves have provided the bulk of the
database on Palaeolithic humans in the Mediterranean and these environments have seen
some of the closest collaboration between geologists and archaeologists. Whilst major
progress has been made in our understanding of both site formation processes and
Mediterranean landscape dynamics, it is argued that we need to think about new ways of
correlating between sites and linking the on-site and off-site records.

[194] The Archaeological Record as an Indicator of Resource Instability: The Case of
Kachemak Bay, Outer Cook Inlet, Alaska
Kachemak Bay, a rich but semi-isolated fjord at the tip of the Kenai Peninsula, was
occupied for ca. 7000 radiocarbon years by bearers of at least six unrelated cultural
traditions. All originated elsewhere and no ancestor-descendant relationship pertains
between them. The Kachemak tradition with a duration of 1500+ years is the longest, other
occupations were briefer. In comparison, the nearby Kodiak Archipelago was occupied for
7000 years by three related cultural traditions. Reasons for this profoundly non-
developmental Kachemak Bay sequence, mirrored elsewhere in Cook Inlet, are to be
sought in environmental factors, especially resource fluctuations over time.

[48] Historical Ecology, Political Ecology: insights from a geoarchaeological study of Islamic
Iberia
Geoarchaeological research in the Lower Alentejo region of Portugal documented a
correlation between dramatically increased rural population densities and widespread soil
erosion during the Islamic period. Controlled comparisons between areas with different
settlement histories show that landscape change was caused by human activities. Age
estimates for strata indicative of hillslope erosion, obtained using OSL and radiocarbon
assays in addition to diagnostic artifacts, are beginning to constrain closely the timing of
that landscape change. In the context of broader archaeological and historical research,
these new data foster new insights into the historical and political factors affecting human
interactions with the environment.

[148] An Ethnohistorical Perspective on Hunter-Gatherer Complexity in South Florida
Although South Florida was neither fully explored or assimilated during the Spanish colonial
era (1513-1760), ethnohistorical records from this era provide tantalizing clues as to the
nature of hunter-gatherer complexity in this broad region. Detailed examination of Spanish
sources reveal both similarities and differences between South Florida groups and the
more well-documented agricultural chiefdoms to the north. Though variations in both space
and time are apparent, South Florida as a whole displays an internal coherence that
distinguishes it as a regional subset of the broader pattern of sociopolitical complexity
across the Southeastern United States.

[193] Rational Movements and Ritual Places: Modeling Hohokam Rock-Art Production in
the South Mountains, Arizona
Recent rock-art research has emphasized landscape contexts as means for elucidating
relationships between rock-art, ritual behaviors, and culturally significant places. Patterns of
movement between such places are of equal importance for understanding the ritual
production and use of rock-art. Based on principles of human behavioral ecology, least-
cost-path analyses serve to model rational, low-cost choices for accessing places across
landscapes. This paper employs such an analysis and compares the distribution of
Hohokam rock-art sites in the South Mountains of south-central Arizona with the costs of
accessing these places to better assess the social and behavioral contexts of Hohokam
rituals.

[190] Models for the Adoption and Spread of Nomadic Pastoralism in Eurasia
Pastoralism and nomadic pastoralism are specialized forms of agricultural production,
therefore the advent and spread of nomadic pastoralism can be examined in ways similar
to the study of the adoption of agriculture. In Northeast Asia nomadic pastoralism is the
predominant aspect of Near Eastern agricultural revolution to be adopted in prehistory. This
paper will consider ethnographic and historical examples of adoption of mobility and
pastoralism into a non-agricultural setting and then turn to an examination of the
archaeological record in Northeast Asia to discuss models of this process for that region.

Late prehistoric subsistence practices, social interactions, and environmental impacts are
explored through a comparative analysis of carbonized plant remains, variations in vessel

Mississippian Stirling Phase settlement and a subsequent Oneota Period occupation.
Results suggest different patterns of plant exploitation and use were practiced by the

shows that many of the same strategies for incorporating archaeological resource
protection could be applied, coupled with an increased emphasis on community-based

[143] The Younger Dryas and Late Glacial Hunter-Gatherer Adaptations in Siberia
The Younger Dryas is represented in numerous terrestrial and lacustrine proxy records of
Pleistocene climate in Siberia. It is typically associated with a return to cold, dry tundra-
steppe environments and a southern and western extension of the permafrost zone. Late
Glacial archaeological sites are numerous along river valleys in the mountains and
lowlands of Southern Siberia, but most are undated and few appear to have been occupied
during the Younger Dryas. As in earlier glacial periods, human populations may have
retreated to protected and ecologically rich mountainous and coastal environments, which
repeatedly served as refugia for Siberian flora and fauna.

[102] Mortuary Ritual at Caves Branch Rockshelter, Belize
Research at Caves Branch Rockshelter has helped demonstrate that the ritual importance
of the site lasted over a millennium. Previous interpretations focused on defining a
specialized function of the site as one part of a diverse local ritual program. The present
study analyzes the range of material culture using AMS and stratigraphy, showing that
much of the variation is temporal. In particular, the extensive mortuary use of the site
changed over time, becoming more restrictive between the Protoclassic and Late Classic
periods. These data support a model of increasing cultural and economic complexity in the
region.

Maya Community
The Chan site has one of the highest concentrations of agricultural terraces in the Maya

However, we know little of the cultivation techniques, crops, or chronology of this
agricultural technology. This paper will discuss excavations on terraces and associated
households dating from the Late Preclassic to the Terminal Classic, providing a more
detailed understanding of the farming population at Chan and how they articulated with the

simplified views of early Alaskan artifact typology and consider lesser known artifact types,

come; her feline presence entrenched in the regional memory of the Gulf Olmec, just as
she prefigures the pantheon of Postclassic goddesses.

Colonial-period codices describe and illustrate the weapons used by several Mesoamerican
chiefdoms and states. Despite wide-spread historical documentation, there has been little
evidence of battlefield sites in Mesoamerica due to low archaeological visibility. To better
define expected lithic assemblages at ancient battlefields and to aid in their discovery, use
experiments were conducted with replicated macahuitl—a sword-like weapon used by
several central Mexican groups. The macahuitl were struck repeatedly against imitations of
human appendages made of ballistics gel and pine dowels. By analyzing the lithic debitage
created experimentally, an ancient Mesoamerican battlefields lithic assemblage model is
hypothesized.

Drawing on several case studies, we highlight the unique contributions that ancient faunal
DNA analysis can make to archaeological investigations. Ancient DNA analysis is capable
of providing accurate species identifications and revealing population changes over time,
significantly enhancing our ability to ask new questions and revisit existing ones. We

analysis; advocate the use of blind-test design to safeguard authenticity of ancient DNA
results; and emphasize the importance of active collaboration between archaeologists and
ancient DNA researchers from the beginning to the end of projects.

from sites occupied between about 2500 and 500 B.P.

[96] The Domestication of Metals in Bronze Age Alalakh
This paper reviews the role of metallurgy in Syro-Anatolia and presents the results of new
analyses from the site of Alalakh. A traditional view of Anatolia in general and the Amuq
Valley settlements in particular is the notion that they are situated within regions with rich
and varied resources. However, what is even more crucial is that they have nurtured bodies
of exotic knowledge such as sophisticated production practices in bronze and iron
,   606                                      ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 73rd ANNUAL MEETING
metallurgy. Put into the context of emergent or indeed collapsing state institutions at
Alalakh during the Late Bronze Age, a very particular kind of knowledge was closely
guarded—that of technological know-how. That is, the specialized skill not only to make
high status items, but to organize strategic production and trade of artifacts that
concentrated privilege to certain sectors of the population. Thus, seemingly utilitarian in
appearance, in time, tools and weapons began to confer wealth and social connectivity
when metal became a preferred material of trade. These artifacts were the products of
skilled personnel who guarded their production practices as much as is in industry today. It
can be argued that the specialists who crafted these difficult to make items, those who
utilized technological knowledge as a valuable tool, passed it on to family and close
affiliates. These craft specialists often were themselves coveted targets of marauding
states on the prowl for resources. The proximity of the copper, arsenic, iron and gold-
bearing veins in the Amanus Mountains as well as the position of the Amuq astride routes
to the deposits of the Taurus Mountains appeared from an early date to have made an
important contribution to the regional economy. This pattern is a resilient one since it
appears that there is at least one other extraction/production cycle later on involving iron.

The Natufian culture of the Levant represents a relatively sedentary, terminal Pleistocene

[24] Shedding Light on Starch Analyses of Charred Pottery Residues via Experimental
Cooking Investigations
Utilitarian cooking pots have received modest attention from archaeologists. Recently,
starch granules have been recovered from the interior charred cooking residues of pottery.
This technique has the potential to greatly expand our knowledge of past human-plant
interactions. However, as most starches are destroyed below the boiling point of water,
food processing and cooking techniques as well as the physiochemical properties of
different starches are all potential factors involved in starch survival, biasing the number

experimental cooking residues to advance the interpretation and quantification of
archaeological analyses.

[185] Perishable Meanings: Tepehuan Ethnography and the Archaeological Record in
Durango, Mexico
In this paper we turn to recent ethnographic investigations among the Southern Tepehuan
of Durango to question local archaeological interpretations. We present modern day
contexts that show how mundane objects and built spaces can take on significance far
beyond the functional or obvious and compare these to archaeological contexts.
Furthermore, we discuss how objects cross cultural lines and are embedded in a complex
process of identity negotiation that tests the bounded categories of archaeological
traditions.

[300] Public Historical Archaeology among the Chontal of Oaxaca
The past of the Chontal people of Oaxaca is one of the most obscure chapters in
Mesoamerican history. Early colonial accounts of this indigenous group were short on
superlatives, although heavily influencing contemporary views. Recent investigations in the
region are now transforming these ethnocentric biases. This presentation will focus on the
various public strategies to incorporate the currently available archaeological, documental,
and oral information within the Chontal village of Zapotitlan, where the research design is
further aiming to incorporate the community as active participants in the postmodern
discourse between the past and the present, and the native and the academic.

[10] Driving Bison on the Two Medicine River, Montana: The Spatial Logic of Kutoyis
The massive alignment of rock features that characterized Blackfoot bison driving on the
Two Medicine River has was long noted by archaeologists but never before mapped. Our
survey explored relationships between landforms and rock features. Stretching across 4.5
square miles, Kutoyis’ bison driving system defied poor mid-distance visibility and
treacherous clay hills, blocking escape routes and least resistance paths while at the same
time protecting strategically located campsites and other structures from stampedes. This
funnel-shaped drive indicates that Blackfoot hunters exerted tremendous control over the
bison herd to drive it across two parallel drainages and into a narrow cliff and chute.

[234] Life Outside of the Royal Court: Site Core Settlement at Minanha
Research into ‘Maya commoners’ and the ‘support population’ of the monumental
epicenters has increased over the last decade. Therefore the focus of excavation at
Minanha was moved outside of the epicenter. Through extensive excavations and analysis,
we hope to elucidate the chronology and the relationships between the non-elite inhabitants
and the royal court. We will also assess the socio-political and economic standing of the
residential groups, possible function of their structures and paint a coherent picture of the
history of the Minanha community outside of the court by evaluating the overall findings
from the site core excavations up to date.

[200] Art and Agency in Jama-Coaque Ceramics, Coastal Ecuador
This paper examines the “anthropological theory of visual art” proposed by anthropologist
Alfred Gell (1998) in which art objects and artifacts are viewed as indexes of social agency.
Gell’s complex scheme for understanding the art nexus and social agency is then explored
with reference to archaeological ceramic artifacts of the Jama-Coaque tradition of coastal
Ecuador (250 BCE-CE 1532). These include (a) a particular vessel form found in
archaeological contexts in the Jama Valley, and (b) elaborate architectural models from
museum collections. Both data sets illustrate the unique role of artifacts as indexes of
political agency associated with chiefly mound centers.

[301] Contesting the Sacred Landscape in Postconquest Oaxaca
Despite priestly efforts to confine religious practice within church walls, miraculous crosses
and apparitions of the Virgin Mary have emerged throughout Mesoamerica since colonial
times, often in the same caves, springs and rocky promontories that indigenous populations
traditionally invested with supernatural significance and which continued to be sites of
“pagan” ritual observance. A program of archaeological and ethnohistorical investigation
outlined here examines the dynamic relationship between Catholic and Mesoamerican
belief and practice in Oaxaca, focusing on the spatial and symbolic interconnections
between the sanctuary and the sacred landscape.

[136] Disconnection, Foreign Insignia, and Political Legitimacy: Revisiting the Dynastic
Symbolism of Piedras Negras
Andrea Stone's (1989) paper on Teotihuacan imagery at Piedras Negras redefined our
view of political legitimacy among the Classic Maya. Contending that foreign motifs
reflected local political concerns rather than Teotihuacan presence, she focused important
attention on the parochial manipulation of foreign symbolism. The argument remains a
compelling one, yet recent findings also urge a reappraisal of the precise political
significance of foreign insignia. As with Tikal and Copan, the Early Classic dynastic founder
of Piedras Negras apparently had foreign connections, suggesting that the Late Classic
revival of Teotihuacan symbolism evoked both the city's own "past" and a "foreign country."

[170] Non-metric Study of Cranial Traits of Ancient Human Remains from North China
A comparative study of 16 non-metric cranial variations was conducted on 336 individuals
unearthed from North China to reconstruct their population affinities. The remains are from
various geographic regions in north China, with antiquity range from neolithic to historical
times (4500£1600BP), representing three archaeologically distinctive groups. The
discrepancy of frequency pattern was observed for different non-metric cranial traits, and
this demonstrates positive correlations among geographic locations, historical records and
frequency of non-metric traits. The study shows the potential to use the variation patterns to
study population migration, population history, and even to trace particular traits for forensic
identification.

The early Neolithic site of Jiahu (9000~7800BP) is located in south Henan, Central China.
Excavation of 2,700 square meters revealed 50 house foundations, 400 pits, 400 burials,
and numerous faunal and floral remains and other cultural artefacts, including: 1) 9000
years old bone flutes still playable today; 2) the earliest domestic pig in China; 3) dominant
rice cultivation in its northern most region; 4) the earliest rice wine fermentation detected
from pot shards; 5) possibly the earliest proto-writing as shown by certain designs on
artifacts; and 6) male skeletal remains with unexpected high stature (1.70-1.80m).

[75] A functional study of lithic artifacts from Zhoukoudian Locality 1: new evidence for
hominid behavior of the Middle Pleistocene in northern China
Zhoukoudian Locality 1 is a cave site known for the discovery of Sinanthropus. Associated
with the human fossils, there are abundant mammal fossils, charcoal ecofacts, and lithic
artifacts. These cultural deposits indicated that this site lasted for a substantial occupational
time (c. 500,000 -200,000 BP), and the stone tool assemblages varied over the three
different cultural phrases. The Last Phase was dated from 300,000 BP to 200,000 BC and
yielded small artifacts that became predominant. Less in frequency in the previous phrases,
the flake tools including points and burins were carefully retouched and became more
standardized. Especially some of well-modified awls also appeared in this time as a part of
toolkit. These changes in lithic assemblages need some of explanation in terms of functions
of these tools. Is this phenomena connected with the climate change? Or how these
Zhoukoudian hominids procured resources in preference of animal or plant substances?
We selected 85 specimens from the upper Layers 1-3 and Layers 4-5 classified to the Third
(Late) Phase for use-wear examination for new interpretative of Peking hominid behaviors
during the Late Period of the Early Paleolithic in northern China.

[223] Ancient DNA Evidence for Population Migrations in Yuan Dynasty China
To determine the origin of the ancient human buried in Zhenzishan cemetery of Upper
Capital site of the Yuan Dynasty in Inner Mongolia, ancient DNA was extracted from 23
ancient individuals in the cemetery. We analyzed both mtDNA HVRI and coding-region
polymorphisms. Phylogenetic and multidimensional scaling analyses were performed
based on mtDNA data from the ancient population and the extant populations. The results
reveal that the ancient individuals from Zhenzishan cemetery belong to Han Chinese and
that the maternal lineages of the individuals with Caucasoid physical character are Asian
origin.

[42] A Dynamic View of Folsom Lithic Technology: Intrasite Analysis of Variation,
Flintknapping Skill, and Individual Projectile Point Producers at Barger Gulch Locality B
The degree of flintknapping skill required for individuals to consistently achieve success in
manufacturing Folsom projectile points brings about the prospect that certain individuals
within the Folsom culture specialized in the production of projectile points. Barger Gulch
Locality B is a prime site for intrasite comparisons with the objective of analyzing
assemblage variability due to varying levels of flintknapping skill. By focusing on those
artifacts related to the projectile point production sequence and comparing those traits
telling of varying levels of skill this paper attempts to elucidate how the Folsom organized
their production of projectile points in camp site settings.

[48] Social Impressions: Bronze Age Cordage Variability in Southern Britain and its
Implications
The small number of Bronze Age perishable artifacts in southern Britain hints at a complex
and locally varied industry of craft production. However, the dearth of examples limits the
degree to which knowledge of such fabricative technologies and technical systems can
augment the rich social models present for this period. This poster presents results
obtained from preliminary ceramic impression analysis of a variety of cord impressed
Bronze Age vessels in southern Britain. General trends, and local and regional variation in
cordage attributes/manufacture are presented. The demographic and socio-technical
implications of the results for this period are considered.

[28] Excavation of the Viking Age Farmstead at Hrísbrú
Over the past four years the Mosfell Archaeological Project has excavated a Viking Age
farmhouse and an associated church at Hrísbrú in southwest Iceland. This paper presents
the archaeological results of the past four years, focusing on the plans of the longhouse
and church, their layout and organization. Finds in the church cemetery and in the
longhouse floor layers shed light on the economic, social, and ritual life on a Viking Age
farm. The archaeological evidence from Hrísbrú is placed in a wider context with analogies
from medieval textual sources and comparisons with other farmstead excavations in the
North Atlantic.

[298] Late Intermediate Period Mortuary Practices at the Pukara de Khonkho: A Preliminary
Analysis
Recent excavations at the Pukara de Khonkho in Bolivia’s Desaguadero Valley may have
identified specific cemetery areas within the site’s terraced walls. The burial pattern
appears distinct from other known Late Intermediate Period mortuary practices in the
region, which emphasizes the uniqueness of a site already differentiated by its large size,
dense domestic habitation, and lack of true defensive walls. This paper presents the results
of the previous season’s research, situating the data in a regional context and suggesting
possible interpretations that could help explain the Pukara de Khonkho’s idiosyncratic
character.

[300] Orthography, Habitus, and Histories: Investigations into an Aymara archaeological
museum
It has been suggested that communities belong to their museums, in as much as museum
narratives express a shared sense of heritage and history. At the same time, it is clear that
communities invariably exhibit some degree of cultural and social fissuring. Taking these
statements at their face value, this paper examines the construction of an archaeological
museum renovated to attract tourism to Bolivia’s Desaguadero Valley. The author draws
attention to the often opposing positions that three factions took concerning the
orthography of the community’s name and proposes that habitus may foster the
compromise of multi-vocal historical narratives.

This paper will outline ongoing archaeobotanical research being carried out in Northern
Labrador. Samples collected from 17th and 18th century houses and middens have been
investigated and the results will be discussed. These initial results contribute to a long term
research agenda focused on a thorough reconstruction of plant resource use by Labrador
Inuit. Intensive analysis of plant remains from archaeological sites can inform larger
questions in Labrador prehistory, such as the impact of the Little Ice Age on Inuit
palaeoeconomy and early contact with Europeans.

decorated artefacts. I go on to consider the kinds of information conveyed by such
artefacts, on the patterns of transmission of such information, and on social and historical
context within which such exchanged occurred.
