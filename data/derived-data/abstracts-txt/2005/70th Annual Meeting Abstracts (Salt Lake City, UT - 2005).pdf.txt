[1] OPENING SESSION • RECENT RESEARCH ON THE PREHISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ARID
AMERICAN WEST
(Sponsored by SAA Program Chair's Session)
Over the past century, much research on the prehistory of the arid American West has focused
on three broad topics: 1) the economics and ecology of Paleo-Indian and Archaic hunter-
gatherers, 2) the spread of agriculture, and 3) the development of social hierarchies, particularly
along the southern California Coast. In recent years, some of the best of this work has been cast
in the theoretical framework of behavioral ecology. The six papers in this symposium provide SAA
visitors from other parts of the world with especially provocative examples of the results of this
research.

“INTERPRETIVE” PROFESSION
[2] POSTER SESSION • CURRENT PERSPECTIVES ON BISON PALEOECOLOGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY
Bison remains have traditionally been an important source of information regarding cultural and
environmental processes throughout North America. Using data derived from modern bison
herds, archaeological faunal assemblages, and paleontological deposits, papers in this session
will examine a diverse array of issues concerning bison biology and ecology, paleoenvironmental
reconstruction, and human predation/processing strategies. A variety of analytical strategies,
including studies of stable isotopes, paleobotanical, osteometric, skeletal morphology, site
formational processes, and cultural modifications, are employed on bison faunal assemblages at
various spatial and temporal scales.

[6] SYMPOSIUM • FOR THE DIRECTOR II: RESEARCH PAPERS ON ENGAGED ARCHAEOLOGY AND
MUSEOLOGY IN HONOR OF RICHARD I. FORD (PART I)
Engaged anthropology---as taught and practiced by Richard I. Ford---is an anthropology informed
by and involved with the lives and cultures of real people, past and present. Papers by Ford's
students and colleagues demonstrate engaged perspectives in archaeological, ethnohistoric,
ethnobiological, and museum collections research, involving cases from across North America.
Strong theoretical links among realms such as belief systems, ecology, landscape, gender, and
colonialism are expressed. Theory emerges from a grounded approach to indigenous concerns
and the educational use and preservation of anthropological museum collections.
[7] SYMPOSIUM • THE PEOPLING OF SOUTH AMERICA: A CRITICAL REVIEW AND CURRENT TRENDS
(PART I)
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on the Americas)
South American archaeology is becoming a crucial player in the debate of the initial colonization
of the Americas. This symposium aims to assemble a group of scholars focusing on the initial
colonization of South America from different perspectives, and to contribute for the development
of productive ways to discuss the peopling of the Americas in general, and South America in
specific, by bringing together (a) several lines of up-to-date evidence and reviews of regional
, 2                                        ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 70TH ANNUAL MEETING
empirical data, (b) a gamut of theoretical approaches, and (c) interdisciplinary studies. Hopefully
this symposium will be a medium for the exchange of ideas between scholars from all the
Americas and beyond.

[8] SYMPOSIUM • THEORIZING PLACE IN ARCHAEOLOGY: PROSPECTS AND POTENTIALITIES (PART I)
This session will use detailed archaeological case studies to explicitly address the concept of
place and explore its potential for archaeological research. Papers will focus on three sets of
questions: 1) What is place, and how might this concept be operationalized to address
archaeological questions? 2) What is the nature of the relationship between place and issues of
identity, memory, meaning and experience? and 3) How did people at particular moments in
history create and recreate places, and in what ways did the places they created shape their
everyday lived experiences?
[9] GENERAL SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE ARCTIC AND SUBARCTIC
[10] SYMPOSIUM • LEARNING IN PLACE: TEACHING IN REPLICATED STRUCTURES
(Sponsored by SAA Public Education Committee)
Replicated structures and reconstructions can be texturally rich environments for teaching about
the human past. This symposium examines the various educational issues and professional
responsibilities that must be considered in the development and building of such sites, as well as
in the design of public programs and curricula. Examples from various locations and time periods
provide insight into the roles that replicas and reconstructions play in conceptual development.
Included in this discussion are their power as images, as multi-sensory learning environments,
and as a context for understanding past human activity.
[11] SYMPOSIUM • HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGIES OF THE INLAND NORTHWEST
When the typical student studies North American archaeology in the western United States they
get a great deal of exposure to the pre-Columbian west, that is life before contact. What has been
profoundly under-represented is the archaeological understanding of the west after Contact. This
is a session which explores the archaeological histories of the west after Contact, that is it is an
exploration of African-American, Asian-American and Euro-American in both urban and rural
contexts in nineteenth and twentieth century Idaho.
[12] SYMPOSIUM • LOWLAND MAYA SETTLEMENT PATTERN STUDIES: TECHNOLOGICAL
TRANSFORMATIONS AND A WEALTH OF DATA
This session will bring together scholars from projects across the Maya lowlands to critically focus
on the impact technological advancements have had on the field of Maya settlement pattern
studies in the past two decades. Papers presented will address one or more of the following
topics: 1) Ground Survey, including GIS and GPS; 2) Remote Sensing; 3) Sampling Methods
and Strategies; Data Standards. This symposium is the first step in specifically detailing the
advancements in lowland Maya settlement pattern studies as we move into the twenty-first
century.
[13] SYMPOSIUM • THE TIES THAT BIND: COMPARATIVE BOUNDARY AREA DYNAMICS IN POSTCLASSIC
MESOAMERICA
Postclassic Mesoamerican boundary dynamics are the focus of this symposium. We will examine
the multidimensionality and permeability of boundary areas throughout Mesoamerica, and how
interactions between polities of varying socio-political organization compared. Archaeological
boundaries are often considered in relation to imperial expansion, but knowledge of boundary
processes less directly associated with empires is lacking. Understanding interactions occurring
in the marginal areas between groups of varying scale and arrangement is especially important to
interregional cultural trends because locally-based networks played a role in paving the way for
pan-regional integrative processes of the Mesoamerican Postclassic.
[14] GENERAL SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGY IN ASIA
[15] SYMPOSIUM • POTTERY MOUND AND THE CULTURAL DYNAMICS OF PUEBLO IV
The Pueblo IV site of Pottery Mound on the Rio Puerco of the east is famous for its spectacular
kiva paintings. The site, with its inventory of both Western and Eastern Pueblo elements is of
critical importance to our understanding of cultural dynamics during the Pueblo IV period in the
Southwest. This session examines the significance of Pottery Mound in regard to regional
interaction, possible migration, cultural (including ritual) exchange, and other social processes
through architecture, ceramics, textiles, and the murals. The 50 years of archaeological
investigations at the site are also reviewed.

[16] FORUM • PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS OF LOW-LEVEL AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN ARCHAEOLOGY (SO
WHY AREN'T YOU USING IT?)
Low-level aerial photography has been accessible to archaeologists for over 100 years. However,
prohibitive costs, limited windows of opportunity, and difficulty in acquiring quality images have
limited its place in the archaeologist's toolbox. Over the last ten years there have been radical
improvements in technology, including: digital photography, GPS, GIS, and available platforms for
near-earth reconnaissance. These advancements have broadened the applications of this
technique and brought aerial archaeology within the grasp of cash-strapped projects. This forum
will focus on how this technique can be better utilized in a broad range of applications, settings,
and budgets.
[17] GENERAL SESSION • THE PLAINS AND THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS
[18] SYMPOSIUM • CULTURAL ADAPTATION AND SOCIOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENT ON THE ANDEAN
COAST
The Andean coast has sustained the development of the earliest complex societies in the New
World. This is due in part to abundant resource potentials within a generally favorable and stable
climate, but also to the ingenuity of Andean coastal communities. This symposium examines the
cultural adaptations and concurrent sociopolitical developments that have nurtured the growth of
complex societies on the Andean coast for the past 4000 years. A comparative, diachronic
approach will emphasize the diversity of cultures and adaptational strategies that have arisen in
coastal valleys from northern Chile to Peru and Ecuador, while recognizing a similar geographical
configuration.
[19] SYMPOSIUM • THEORY, HISTORY, AND ARCHAEOLOGY: EXPLAINING VARIABILITY AND CONTINUITY
AMONG THE CALIFORNIA ISLANDS
Since their definition maritime hunter-gatherers have remained problematic for those attempting
to provide a unified theory explaining variability across the range of hunter-gatherer societies.
This session brings together diverse perspectives on the California Islands, with emphasis on
variability and continuity in the natural and cultural systems that characterize these islands. New
data and insights are discussed along with the merits and weaknesses of various explanatory
models within the particular contexts investigated by the participants. The goal is to utilize the rich
and varied data sets of these islands to consider the maritime hunter-gatherer experience through
integrated perspectives.
[20] SYMPOSIUM • SITUATING ARCHAEOLOGY WITHIN THE POSTCOLONIAL CONDITION
Postcolonial theory questions the histories, literatures, and anthropologies produced by the
Western academic canon, asserting that traditional studies generated within colonial contexts
distort the experiences, alter the realities, and inscribe inferiority onto colonized peoples. We
challenge American archaeologists to critically situate themselves in a postcolonial context. What
is the place of archaeology in postcolonial studies? Is archaeology a colonial endeavor by
definition, or can material culture be used to counter dominant histories? How does archaeology
enable postcolonial peoples to articulate their identities? This session attempts to address these
questions and highlights the distorted junctures at which American archaeologists practicing in
postcolonial conditions find themselves today.
[21] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESIDUE ANALYSIS; PART I: THEORY
The two sessions of this symposium aim to provide an overview of the problems and possibilities
of collecting data on organic residues in archaeological materials. A variety of techniques will be
discussed, as well as the results of the analysis of the same, experimental residue by several
laboratories (the 'round robin' experiment). At the end of each session a short debate between
the speakers and the audience will be mediated by two discussants.
[22] GENERAL SESSION • POLITICS, FEASTING, GENDER, AND SYMBOLISM IN THE SOUTHWEST
[23] SYMPOSIUM • FROM ANTHILLS TO HORSE MANURE: PROVENANCE CHARACTERIZATION OF SAND-
TEMPERED CERAMICS FROM THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
Petrographic analysis of rock and mineral temper has been used to characterize pottery
provenance for more than a century. With the advent of standardized point counting methods in
the 1950s, statistical comparison of temper to potential geologic sources became possible. The
petrofacies method developed since the 1980s provided another leap forward, as multivariate
statistical techniques were available to classify provenance. Symposium papers demonstrate the
application of petrographic methods to pottery provenance characterization. Examples include the
, 6                                         ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 70TH ANNUAL MEETING
full range of petrographic techniques, from initial descriptive characterization to petrofacies
provenance analysis, with an emphasis on how detailed petrographic information enhances
archaeological interpretation.
[23A] PRESIDENT’S INVITED FORUM: THE IMPACT OF POSTMODERNISM ON AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY:
THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE JURY IS STILL OUT
Like most academic disciplines, archaeology has, over the past 20 years, been influenced by
Postmodernism. The degree of that influence and perceptions about the positive or negative
consequences of that influence vary. Given the basic premise of Postmodernism, that
objectivity—in our case, objectivity in creating knowledge of past human societies—does not
exist, some may find it surprising that there has been any influence at all! Nevertheless,
Postmodernism is, for good or ill, a prominent feature of the American archaeological landscape.
The forum participants will discuss the positive impacts of this school of thought and the negative
impacts, as well as those areas of our discipline where it is still too soon to determine whether the
impacts will ultimately be salutary or pernicious.
[24] POSTER SESSION • THE STORIES BEHIND THE NUMBERS: GENDERED PERCEPTIONS OF
ARCHAEOLOGY AMONG ITS PRACTITIONERS
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on the Status of Women in Archaeology)
The recent SAA Member Needs Assessment Survey included a series of questions sponsored by
the Committee for the Status of Women in Archaeology. These questions focused on several
issues for women in archaeology including publishing, funding, and conference opportunities;
sexism and the glass ceiling syndrome in the workplace; and juggling a family and a career. The
purpose of this poster session is to explore the gendered perception of archaeology, and to share
the experiences of women and men as professional practitioners. It is hoped that this session will
create space for a dialog about issues for women in archaeology.

Engaged anthropology--as taught and practiced by Richard I. Ford---is an anthropology informed
by and involved with the lives and cultures of real people, past and present. Papers by Ford's
students and colleagues demonstrate engaged perspectives in archaeological, ethnohistoric,

history create and recreate places, and in what ways did the places they created shape their
everyday lived experiences?
[32] SYMPOSIUM • ANCIENT FOOTPATHS, THE CONSTRUCTION OF MEANING, AND THE ORIGINS OF
MONUMENTALITY IN COSTA RICA
The Proyecto Prehistorico Arenal in Costa Rica used NASA remote sensing with field verification
by trenching and stratigraphy to confirm two sets of ancient footpaths in 2002-2004. A primary
objective was largely met: determine endpoints and explore the reasons why people used
particular paths. Endpoints include cemeteries, villages, springs, and stone sources for tomb
construction. Sustained path use had the unanticipated consequence of deep entrenchment,
which evidently became the culturally desired mode of entry into special places. We may have
discovered the egalitarian origins of the monumental entrenched entryways built by later complex
societies such as Cutris and Guayabo.
[33] SYMPOSIUM • HOW DO WE SAVE THE ORPHANS: WORKING WITH ABANDONED (OR HOMELESS)
COLLECTIONS
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on Curation and SAA Ethics Committee)
One of the biggest problems in collections management is how to deal with orphaned collections-
-cultural artifacts that have no one to fund their curation and are in danger of being lost. Such
materials become homeless in several ways: consulting firms go out of business; cultural
resource branches are closed by large parent corporations; professors retire or pass away
leaving their research without any provision for their continued care. Within this session we
explore the magnitude of this issue and innovative ways of solving this problem.
[34] FORUM • POPULARIZING THE ANCIENT SOUTHWEST: ARE WE PRESERVATION PARTNERS OR
ACCESSORIES TO A CRIME?
Public interest in the ancient American Southwest is fueled by the works of writers, artists,
educators, and a growing number of back country guide services. Many archaeologists believe
that publicity generated by these popular media benefits resource stewardship by increasing
public awareness and support for the preservation of archaeological sites. Others maintain that
these activities draw unnecessary attention to unprotected archaeological sites, which ultimately
leads to their destruction from unmanaged visitation and deliberate vandalism. This forum will
explore the pros and cons of this controversial topic through a series of brief presentations
representing diverse viewpoints, followed by a moderated discussion.
[35] SYMPOSIUM • CIRCLES, SYMBOLISM, AND SPACE: THE DISTRIBUTION AND MEANING OF CIRCLES IN
THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOGRAPHIC RECORDS
This symposium explores the function, heuristic, and symbolic meanings of circular
archaeological and ethnohistoric features. Southern Great Basin and Sonoran Desert sites are
often dominated by circular features, yet these features are enigmatic: they are rarely associated
with artifacts, yet are widely distributed throughout the region. Circular patterns are also one of
the most common motifs in prehistoric "art." Native American participants explain why and how
the circle is symbolically central to their belief systems. Archaeologists examine the distribution
and function of circular features and circular rock art motifs. Together these viewpoints provide
new insights into poorly understood phenomena.
[36] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY IN IDAHO: RESEARCH, PARTNERSHIPS, AND VOLUNTEERS
Archaeologists in Idaho continue to make strides in understanding how people lived in the state
for the past 14,000 years. These presentations will highlight recent work that includes inventory
projects on rock art sites, excavation of sites along the Clearwater River, an examination of the
archaeology of the Nez Perce War, and a re-analysis of information from the Challis Bison Jump.
Partnerships with universities, preservation groups, and agencies, and the cadre of experienced
volunteers are instrumental in helping archaeologists meet the goals of these varied projects.
[37] FORUM • THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL GRAY LITERATURE
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on Curation)
Gray literature is unpublished, has limited circulation, is rarely cataloged in libraries and,
therefore, is often difficult to find. Archaeologists produce thousands of gray literature reports
each year, while at the same time hundreds of older reports are lost. This forum will initiate
discussion of and explore options for providing access to the constantly growing body of
archaeological gray literature. Issues include access, sensitivity of information, quality control of
content, electronic publishing, archiving, and how to build on the National Archeological Database

represented.
[38] SYMPOSIUM • AGENCY WITHIN THE PERIPHERY: VIEWS FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE
The concept of interaction has a long and varied history in archaeological theory. However, the
focus has generally been on core areas, or has approached "peripheral" areas from a centric
perspective. Studies here explore traditionally peripheral areas, located in both the New and Old
Worlds, and how concepts of interaction have changed. The emphasis is on group agency and
identity to explain the complexity of material culture, rather than on cultural-historic views based
upon concepts of diffusion, the movement of intrusive groups, or ecology.
[39] SYMPOSIUM • INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGY AT THE TROWEL’S EDGE: FIELD SCHOOLS, PEDAGOGY,
AND COLLABORATION
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on Native American Relations and SAA Committee on
Curriculum)
This session considers the nature of indigenous archaeology and collaborations between
archaeological and Native American/First Nations communities in the context of field schools and
similar venues of practical archaeology training. Participants will address the role of field classes,
particularly tribally-sponsored ones, in indigenous archaeology, the ways that collaborative field
schools and training classes can and should directly benefit tribal communities, and the changes
in methodological and pedagogical field techniques that have resulted from collaboration. The
session contends that we must scrutinize not just how we think about and do archaeology, but
also how we teach and learn it.
[40] GENERAL SESSION • MIDWEST AND GREAT LAKES ARCHAEOLOGY
[41] WORKING GROUP • THE LATE POSTCLASSIC-COLONIAL MAYA TRANSITION: CURRENT RESEARCH
AND NEW PERSPECTIVES
Spanish conquest brought great changes across the entire Maya area, although certain Maya
groups experienced substantial Spanish influence, while others were contacted rarely, or actively
resisted conquest. The variable nature of the contact affected Maya lives differently in distinct
regions, and caused different degrees of archaeological change between the Postclassic and the
Colonial periods. Participants will discuss recent fieldwork from Honduras, Belize, Yucatan, and
Guatemala in an attempt to update our understanding of the Colonial transition. They will build
upon Postclassic-Colonial Maya research from the past three decades, while engaging with
current method and theory, such as household archaeology.
[42] SYMPOSIUM • CRAFTING SOCIETY: MATERIALS TECHNOLOGIES OF COMPLEX SOCIETIES IN THE
OLD AND NEW WORLDS
Materials and the way people manage them are an integral part of the human experience.
Materials and the technologies they foster both influence and are influenced by culture. In making
choices within the constraints imposed by the physical properties of materials, people develop
technologies grounded in and which express technological needs and social values. We explore
in this symposium the synergistic relationships between societies and their materials
technologies, encompassing both a wide array of materials and varied approaches to their study.
[43] SYMPOSIUM • RETHINKING RAIN FOREST OCCUPATION: NEW RESEARCH DIRECTIONS IN TROPICAL
ARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by Archaeology Division, American Anthropological Association)
This symposium will explore new developments in the theoretical, archaeological, and ecological
understanding of the prehistoric occupation of low latitude rain forest habitats. Common themes
of paleoecology, environmental change, subsistence strategies, agriculture/arboriculture, and
sociocomplexity are examined with respect to inferring the nature of human adaptation, food
procurement, settlement, and habitat modification that may have occurred during the late
Pleistocene and Holocene periods. Interdisciplinary approaches are emphasized and new
methodologies examined. Local and regional case studies from Australasia, Africa, and the
Americas will be presented and discussed.
[44] SYMPOSIUM • THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM 50,000 TO 25,000 BP: TURNING POINTS AND NEW
DIRECTIONS

50,000 to 25,000 BP. It is an attempt to bring together archaeologists who do research in different
parts of the Mediterranean littoral, and on theoretical perspectives, to compare and discuss
results from the various areas. We hope to gain a retrospective on this issue, assess how the
subject is being studied at present, the latest results and current knowledge, and propose
guidelines that will mark this research in the coming years.
[45] SYMPOSIUM • ANCIENT APPRENTICESHIP
Learning a craft, a physical learning process, is based on observation, imitation and most
importantly, repetition. This symposium concentrates on the types of knowledge and the methods
of knowledge transfer by craftsmen in the social context of learning. Subjects that will be covered
are: how do we recognize the work of apprenticeship or evidence of learning in the archaeological
material; what are the social aspects of knowledge transfer in relation to social mobility;
engendering knowledge transfer; the epistemology of craftsmanship and lastly, the use of insights
gained by discerning different types of knowledge and learning in teaching archaeology.
[46] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESIDUE ANALYSIS; PART II: PRACTICE
The two sessions of this symposium aim to provide an overview of the problems and possibilities
of collecting data on organic residues in archaeological materials. A variety of techniques will be
discussed, as well as the results of the analysis of the same, experimental residue by several
laboratories (the 'round robin' experiment). At the end of each session a short debate between
the speakers and the audience will be mediated by two discussants.
[47] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES OF COOKING AND FOOD PREPARATION
We typically view cooking as an individual activity of little social value, and as something that
takes place in private domestic spaces, largely disconnected from political life and our social
worlds. But several archaeological, ethnographic, and sociological studies in the past decades
clearly point to cooking as an activity with important social consequences. In this panel we
present a variety of case studies from different areas of the world that examine the social,
economic, and political aspects of cooking by drawing from diverse lines of archaeological and
historical evidence.
[48] SYMPOSIUM • USING NUCLEAR CHEMISTRY TO ANSWER CULTURAL QUESTIONS: RECENT
APPLICATIONS OF INAA IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
Archaeologists have increasingly turned to the physical sciences for reliable chemistry-based
analytical techniques to match artifacts with raw-material sources. In the American Southwest, we
have reached a watershed moment in the application of one such technique, instrumental neutron
activation, moving beyond the analysis of data from small, individual projects to the creation of
large databases with multiple researchers. These larger databases enable the researchers in this
session to investigate broad anthropological topics such as the mobility patterns and migrations
of people, cultural responses to conflict and stress, community social organization, the
development of craft production and specialization, and the use of ceramics in the creation and
maintenance of social boundaries and identity.

BLUFF/COMB WASH PROJECT
Chaco-style great houses have long been recognized in the northern San Juan region, although
the nature of influence from Chaco Canyon is debated. Even though the Chacoan regional
system ended about A.D. 1150, some great houses in the northern San Juan continued in use
until the late 1300s. University of Colorado investigations focus on Chaco/post-Chaco patterns in
SE Utah at the Bluff Great House and Comb Wash Community. Our posters explore continuity in
Chacoan architecture, settlement patterns, and landscape features, as well as changes in great
house function and the role of great kivas as a ritual focus.

comparison with many physical records, such as stratigraphic pollen and phytolith analyses. In
addition, understanding the past climate and environment assists in understanding movement of

peoples, adaptation of people to their local environment, use of resources, decision making
parameters, and much more. This poster symposium presents a variety of applications of
Archaeoclimatic modeling.
[54] SYMPOSIUM • ORGANIZED VIOLENCE IN PRECOLUMBIAN AMERICA
The categories of sport, mock combat, warfare, and ritual have largely controlled the discourse on
organized violence in the Precolumbian Americas. Scholarly attitudes toward the relations of
these categories shade from intimately interrelated to mutually exclusive. This session proposes
to lay open these categories and their relations for inspection. How do the analytical categories
we use to construct Ancient American history relate to indigenous notions of organized violence?
How do these categories relate to other areas of Precolumbian thought and practice? What are
the limits and rewards of ethnohistorical data on violence?
[55] SYMPOSIUM • CONTEMPORARY PERSPECTIVES IN CHINESE NEOLITHIC ARCHAEOLOGY
Nearly twenty years ago, the publication of the fourth edition of K.C. Chang's "The Archaeology of
Ancient China" marked the beginning of a new era in the study of Chinese Neolithic archaeology.
Since that time, much new information on the Chinese Neolithic has accumulated. In this
symposium, scholars working in different regions across China will discuss the construction of
new models for Chinese Neolithic societies (operative at a variety of scales) and the empirical
evaluation of these models, applying new analytical approaches and adopting comparative
perspectives.
[56] SYMPOSIUM • FOURTH MILLENNIUM B.P. ADOPTION OF DOMESTICATED MAIZE AND SQUASH IN THE
NORTH AMERICAN SOUTHWEST: THE ASSEMBLAGE FROM MCEUEN CAVE, SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA
McEuen Cave, a Late Middle Archaic through Early Agricultural dry residential rockshelter in
southeastern Arizona has yielded 23 Zea mays and Cucurbita pepo remains dating between
3491 and 4360 radiocarbon years (RCY) B.P. There can be no doubt that maize and squash
arrived in the Southwest by 4000 dendrocalibrated years B.P., during a time dominated by a
hunter-gatherer lifeway. The symposium examines these new data as well as the material
assemblage of McEuen Cave in relation to other Archaic sites in the Southwest and northern
Mexico. The session will end with various interpretive ideas by the principals.
[57] GENERAL SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGY IN OCEANIA
[58] SYMPOSIUM • FINE PASTE RELIEF WARES OF ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
Fine paste wares are part of a wide-spread cultural phenomenon during the latter part of the first
millennium. Pabellon Molded-carved ceramics have been considered a marker of the Classic
Maya collapse. Traditionally associated with "foreign" influences, archaeologists now place the
production of Pabellon well within the Pasion drainage. But what is the relationship between
Pabellon and other fine paste relief wares, including Rio Blanco from Veracruz, imitation Pabellon
wares from Yucatan, and similar wares found at Teotihuacan? Using approaches from
archaeology, art history, iconography, and epigraphy, this session explores the origins,
composition, and distribution of Mesoamerican fine paste relief wares, seeking new answers to
old questions to create a fresh synthesis.
[59] SYMPOSIUM • COMIC BOOK AND CARTOON ARCHAEOLOGY
This session brings together creators and publishers of archaeology comic books, cartoons, and
zines to discuss their individual works as well as present a theoretical overview of this part of the
discipline. Their presentations are rooted within the visual and public archaeologies, recount
individual methodologies that serve as useful guides for others, and show how comic books and
related genre are fundamental to the goals of archaeology. This session serves both those
interested in the state of comic book and cartoon archaeology today and those who hope to use
such works to shape the future of the discipline.

[63] SYMPOSIUM • HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY OF, BY, AND ABOUT THE MORMONS
Historical Archaeology on Mormon-occupied sites began in the early 1960s with Church-
sponsored excavations at the historic city of Nauvoo, Illinois. Since then, archaeologists both
inside and outside the Church have conducted numerous excavations at Mormon-occupied sites
throughout the United States. This session highlights some of the most important of these
excavations, illustrating the contributions archaeological investigations have made to a more
complete understanding of the Mormon past. At the same time, these papers examine and
demonstrate the theoretical and methodological differences that exist between excavations
sponsored by a religious organization and those conducted by academic, museum, and CRM
archaeologists.
[64] SYMPOSIUM • FINDING THE OVERLOOKED: EXPLORING SMALLER SOCIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS IN
THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD
(Sponsored by SAA Student Affairs Committee)
In recent years, archaeologists have focused on the study of social and ethnic identities, and in
particular, archaeologists have sought to include groups previously excluded from narratives
about the past. Archaeologists have found the line of material evidence marking different social or
ethnic units is frequently blurred and that the identity of a member of a group can be renegotiated
in relation to that person's surroundings. This state of affairs raises several questions about the
study of small social and ethnic groups. Papers in this session will address theoretical and
methodological approaches to these issues through several case studies.
[65] FORUM • WAR AND PEACE: THE FATE OF CULTURAL RESOURCES IN IRAQ
(Sponsored by SAA Government Affairs Committee)
The looting of Iraqi museums and archaeological sites during and after the March 2003 invasion
focused the world's attention on the problem of cultural resources theft and the key roles that
government and the archaeological community play in the struggle to stem such destruction. This
session will focus on how archaeologists worked with the U. S. Congress and the administration
to protect Iraq's cultural heritage before and during the war and how archaeologists in Iraq and
from around the world are rebuilding the institutions that preserve and interpret Iraq's past.
[66] SYMPOSIUM • FROM CONQUEST TO CONVERGENCE: RECENT RESEARCH ON THE TRANSITION FROM
INDIGENOUS TO SPANISH RULE IN THE ANDES
Archaeological study of the shift from indigenous to Spanish rule in the Andes lags far behind
documentary inquiry. Yet, by moving outside of written texts, archaeological investigation is
uniquely situated to contest, complement, and bypass the perspective of the colonizer inherent in
documentary sources, and illustrate how colonialist pretensions to domination translated into local
processes of cultural convergence, resistance, and adaptation. Building towards a comparative
perspective on pre- and post-hispanic colonialism, this session brings together contact-era
researchers working at several spatial and temporal scales to provide a preliminary panorama of
these processes in a variety of regional locales.
[67] SYMPOSIUM • THE PREHISTORY OF SHAMANISM: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF DREAMS
(Sponsored by ICOMOS)
Holistic archaeological research requires attention, not just to adaptation, economy and
technology, but also to cognition and belief. Despite this fact, the archaeological study of religion
remains underdeveloped. A logical starting point for such studies in the Americas is prehistoric
shamanistic religions, because of the pervasiveness of this religious system throughout the
hemisphere. Though commonly identified and studied using art and iconography, we look beyond
these data sources alone to consider the evidence and implications of shamanistic beliefs, ritual
practices and socio-politics in the larger archaeological record.
[68] SYMPOSIUM • ETHNIC IDENTITIES IN THE INKA EMPIRE
Recent concerns with identity in archaeology--particularly ethnic identity--represent a profound
transformation in the problematics that underlie and motivate archaeological research in the post-
processual era. With the rich body of evidence available for the late precolumbian Andes, we see

scholars in this area as having a significant contribution to make to current theoretical debates
regarding the roots, meaning, and uses of ethnicity in both the past and present. The
juxtaposition of ethnohistorical sources with the archaeological record of production, distribution,
and stylistic variation offers fertile terrain for exploring the relationship between material culture
and ethnicity.

[71] POSTER SESSION • CHANGING SOCIAL AND ECOLOGICAL DYNAMICS ON THE WESTERN ALASKA
PENINSULA AND ADJACENT ISLANDS
Long-term multidimensional research on the Western Alaska Peninsula has focused on humans
as part of the northern ecosystems where the modern and the prehistoric, the terrestrial and the
marine, the local and the regional, and the empirical and theoretical are all interrelated. We
suggest that this multidimensional approach is not only possible but necessary to our
understanding of the North Pacific region. We suggest that through multifaceted social dynamics
the Aleut conditioned the structure of complex ecosystems. They were not simple and passive
harvesters, but were rather active participants in a regional system that included them at the top
of the food chain. The implications of this type of approach are profound and require the
integration of anthropology, archaeology, geology, ecology, and history, the perspective of all
spatial and temporal scales, and the seamless merging of various theoretical approaches from
the most humanistic to the most deterministic.
[72] SYMPOSIUM • NEW PERSPECTIVES ON HUMAN SACRIFICE AND RITUAL BODY TREATMENTS IN
ANCIENT MAYA SOCIETY
The Symposium provides new information and novel perspectives on human sacrifice and ritual
body treatments in ancient Maya society, addressing explicitly the discussion surrounding the
cache-burial determination of depositions containing human remains and their ritual histories,
along with the meanings and procedures that make up body parts interments. For this purpose,
the contributions propose and apply a broad array of concepts that derive from epigraphy, art,
literature and bioarchaeology. They encompass ritual behavior and meaning, marks of
perimortem violence, posthumous heat exposure and body processing, provenience of sacrificial
victims and their living conditions.
[73] SYMPOSIUM • SUBSISTENCE AND POLITICAL ECONOMIES IN THE PETEN LAKES REGION: NEW
INSIGHTS FROM MOTUL DE SAN JOSE, GUATEMALA
Since 1998, multi-disciplinary investigations by the Motul de San Jose Project have been
dedicated to assessing one of the key issues in Maya archaeology: to what extent were Maya
polities economically centralized or decentralized? This session explores this question through an
examination of subsistence and political economies of the Motul de San Jose polity.
Archaeological investigations at Motul and nearby sites document evidence for craft production,
agricultural systems, and larger historical processes. Regional investigations focus on delineating
the environmental and landscape parameters of the Motul polity. Combined, these investigations
will present a complex mosaic of economic integration and interaction.
[74] SYMPOSIUM • APPLIED INDIGENOUS ARCHAEOLOGY
Applied indigenous archaeology uses archaeological knowledge to solve broader societal
concerns relevant to indigenous people. Applying archaeology to benefit indigenous people can
solve a variety of issues and concerns. Cultural resource management, NAGPRA, and land
claims are usual focal points for applied indigenous archaeology. Increasingly, indigenous
peoples have turned to archaeology to help solve issues of cultural preservation, education,
reconstructing culture history, and developing museums and exhibits. These applied trends
towards broader indigenous concerns are critical to the maintenance of cultural heritage while

[75] SYMPOSIUM • MONTANE SETTLEMENT AND RESOURCE EXPLOITATION BY PREHISTORIC FARMERS
OF THE NORTH AMERICAN W EST
Most archaeological discussions of high elevation montane use in the North American West
center on hunter-gatherer seasonal rounds. In order to better understand how the introduction of
staple crops affected perceptions of mountains and their resources, this symposium will examine
prehistoric farmers and farming communities that utilized the mountain ranges of Utah and
Arizona. Topics ranging from settlement and subsistence to paleonutrition will focus on the
Fremont of northern and central Utah, the Anasazi of northwestern Arizona, and the Sinagua of
north-central Arizona.

[78] SYMPOSIUM • THE LATE ACHEULIAN: A NEW INTERPRETATION FROM EASTERN JORDAN
During the Pleistocene an inland lacustrine corridor comprising a chain of lake basins extended
through Jordan and Syria. These basins were extensively exploited by Homo erectus, who left
enormous Acheulian assemblages absolutely dominated by bifacial tranchet cleavers. The oasis
sites document a pattern of hunting and butchery of savannah megafauna of the African realm.
The symposium reviews current research on the Acheulian of the inland corridor and the
implications of cleaver uselife for understanding the character of Acheulian assemblages and
technology.
[79] SYMPOSIUM • ROCK-ART, RESEARCH, AND INDIGENOUS COMMUNITIES
One factor driving the current resurgence in rock-art studies is the rediscovered importance of
ethnohistory/ethnography. Looking at ancient pictures, we are not obliged just to "gaze and
guess": there are research approaches that increasingly give access to issues of meaning. Rock-
art is also increasingly important to indigenous communities: marked on the very land, it is visibly
more accessible than dirt archaeology. These happy new circumstances change the ways rock-
art researchers go about their studies and the social context of their work. One is no longer the
research scientist working to the academic agenda alone or the observations of analytical science
alone.
[80] SYMPOSIUM • APPLYING BIOLOGICAL PRINCIPLES TO EVOLUTIONARY PROBLEMS IN
ARCHAEOLOGY
In 1989, Robert Dunnell observed that archaeological mortuary complexes in the American
Midwest coincided with fluctuating carrying capacity, and that evolutionary theory can account for
that association. Since then, other publications have applied the "bet-hedging" model (as it is
known in the biological literature) to the archaeological record, showing that temporally fluctuating
environments are associated with dramatic changes in human energy expenditure across many
classes of archaeological observable phenomena. These papers focus on further application of
the model, with research ranging from reconstruction of fluctuating environments, to issues of
classification, to the nature of cultural elaborations, and to demographic implications.
[81] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY, ART, AND ETHNOGENESIS IN MESOAMERICAN PREHISTORY: PAPERS
IN HONOR OF GARETH W. LOWE
Over his 40 year career of archaeological investigation in southern Mexico, Gareth Lowe
conducted and promoted research at numerous Formative sites, Chiapa de Corzo and Izapa
being the best known. Gareth had an amazing grasp of early ceramics and other artifacts, and he
used his knowledge of archaeological minutia to understand the broad histories of first peoples, in
particular, the ancient interactions among Mixe-Zoques (a.k.a., Olmecs) and Mayas. Papers in
this session follow Lowe's concern for synthetic understandings of ancient peoples in southern
Mesoamerica.

[84] FORUM • THE PALIMPSEST IN GEOARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by SAA Geoarchaeology Interest Group)
The term 'palimpsest' describes the now widely acknowledged complexity of archaeological
deposits. But palimpsests remain problematic because no consensus exists among
archaeologists on how to analyze or interpret them. Palimpsests are often seen as disturbed
deposits, contrasted with 'in situ,' 'living floor,‘ feature, or other deposits. Such practice, however,
oversimplifies the reality of the archaeological record. A more nuanced concept of palimpsests is
important for dealing with the archaeology of all locations and time periods. This Forum seeks
that understanding, considering interpretations and methods that bridge both the reality of
archaeological deposits and the goals of archaeology across the globe.
[85] SYMPOSIUM • CASTING ROLES: ARE CASTE GROUPS VISIBLE IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD?
Ethnographically, caste societies are a unique social form that is present throughout the world.
Yet there has been little archaeological research focused on distinguishing the presence and
development of caste groups in prehistory and history. In this symposium, we will present
research from Africa and Asia that enlists archaeological, ethnoarchaeological, linguistic, and
biological studies that bring to the forefront a variety of theoretical perspectives concerning
whether caste groups as a form of identity are visible or not in the archaeological record.
[86] SYMPOSIUM • GETTING OUR HANDS DIRTY: PUTTING FEMINIST THEORY INTO ARCHAEOLOGICAL
PRACTICE
Proliferation of conference sessions, articles, and books reaffirms that feminist perspectives have
found their place within archaeology. Remaining at issue, however, is the applicability of these
broad social theories, with foci ranging from gender studies to queer theory, to actual data.
Consequently, our ability to relate feminism to the material remains of past human behaviors
becomes ever more relevant. This session supplies a forum for scholars to apply feminist theories
to specific case studies. Contributors address the question: ‗How pertinent are feminist
understandings of sex, gender, identity and difference to our research, given the limitations of
empirical archaeological datasets?‘
[87] SYMPOSIUM • PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM THE 2004 FIELD SEASON AT TIWANAKU, BOLIVIA
This symposium presents the results of a multidisciplinary research program on the urban form
and socio-political dynamics of the monumental site of Tiwanaku, Bolivia (AD 500-1000). This
symposium presents recent data from the 2004 field season while revalorizing previous
unpublished and underpublished research at the site. The results from this initial field season
suggest that a complex relationship between residential and ritual areas characterized the urban
core. This research highlights the value of geophysical survey, select excavations and micro-
analysis as a quick and cost efficient method for developing a broad understanding of complex
large-scale sites.
[88] SYMPOSIUM • PALEOINDIAN OR PALEOARCHAIC? NEW INSIGHTS ON LATE PLEISTOCENE-EARLY
HOLOCENE ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE GREAT BASIN
Paleoindian/Paleoarchaic research in the Great Basin traditionally has been hampered by a lack
of well-stratified, sealed sites with preserved organic material for reconstructing chronology,
paleoecology, and foraging behaviors. New excavations, coupled with innovative analyses of
floral, faunal, and surface lithic assemblages, are increasing our understanding of early human
organization. The papers in this symposium address a series of questions: Was the Great Basin
inhabited prior to 11,000 radiocarbon years ago? How are fluted and stemmed point technologies
related? What foraging and land-use strategies characterized the region's early human
inhabitants? How did climate change affect humans during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene?
[89] SYMPOSIUM • THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL
SIMULATION
For 30 years, simulation has been used in Archaeology to address a wide range of problems.
While there has been a great deal of excellent simulation work done in the discipline, simulation
in Archaeology has yet to become truly archaeological simulation. Building on last year‘s round
table luncheon on progress in Archaeological simulation since 1970, the symposium will bring
together scholars interested in answering the question: ‗What are the theoretical and
methodological requirements for a specifically archaeological application of computer simulation
methods?‘ Each paper is expected to address this question from its author‘s individual
perspective.

and how to strategize for particular career tracks. The panelists in this forum represent a range of
career tracks in archaeology and will discuss the various strategies they have used to advance in
their respective careers. Discussion topics will include particular issues that women and other
underrepresented groups in archaeology may face in their career paths, mentoring and
networking, and creative strategies for dealing with professional barriers and setbacks.

Since his seminal study of human ecology on the Deh Luran plain, Frank Hole has remained at
the forefront of Near Eastern and anthropological archaeology. He has made paradigm-shifting
contributions to essentially all of the major areas of archaeological investigation--from the first
populations to the origins of agriculture and village life, to the emergence of social complexity.
Hole's pioneering work in human landscapes plays a central role in our understanding of the
prehistory of the Near East. This symposium honors the high standard of scholarship, innovation,

issues but connects students with human experiences and needs. Actual teaching trunks will be
available for examination by conference participants. Presenters will be available to discuss how
the trunks were created and used.
[97] SYMPOSIUM • THE WEB OF LIFE: STRUCTURE, AGENCY, AND IDENTITY IN ANCIENT SOUTHWESTERN
COMMUNITIES
Communities, as the nexus for face-to-face social interactions, are an appropriate context in
which to examine the interplay of structure and agency and the formation of social identities.
Identity is constructed through daily practice that occurs in the context of community life. In part,
identity is shaped by historically derived structure, but it is also something that is actively
manipulated through the agency of individuals. This symposium examines structure, agency, and
identity in ancestral Pueblo communities in the southwestern United States. Papers in this
symposium explore this topic by analyzing social action within and between communities.
[98] SYMPOSIUM • MOBILE FARMERS, MIGRANTS, AND PERMEABLE BOUNDARIES: PUTTING THE
MOGOLLON RIM IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
The Mogollon Rim is a prominent physiographic feature that coincides with contemporary political
boundaries. During much of the past, however, the Rim region had mutable social boundaries.
This symposium presents new research by the Silver Creek Archaeological Research Project that
discusses how this porous boundary was variably constructed at several times ranging from the
Late Pithouse period to historic period Western Apache and Anglo settlements. Collectively, the
papers show how residential mobility and migration combined to create socially dynamic
landscapes in this pivotal area, and how this research is relevant to management issues
important to the White Mountain Apache Tribe.

the dead and the living. We are particularly interested in varied forms of interaction between them
that can be archaeologically studied, such as tomb visitation and subsequent modification, as well
as anthropologically documented events such as feasting, dance, and sacrifice.

The Repatriation Office at the National Museum of Natural History was created in 1991 to
implement the repatriation provisions of the 1989 National Museum of American Indian Act. The
Act requires the Smithsonian to repatriate human remains and funerary objects, and by a 1996

The Bridge River Site located in south-central British Columbia, Canada is a complex hunter-
gatherer site on the interior Canadian Plateau. The site consists of 80 pithouses and at least 150
external pit features that have yielded an extensive array of artifacts, shedding light on the
emergence of socio-cultural complexity of the region. This symposium will take a multidisciplinary

The Kern River 2003 Expansion Pipeline traversed 717 miles, from southwestern Wyoming
through Utah and Nevada to California, crossing sites representing several thousand years of
prehistory. The archaeological project employed a wide variety of analyses, integrated with
current research and theory, to define the range of cultural variation through time and space and
to develop models of cultural adaptation to account for the defined variability. Important
contributions are highlighted, addressing such topics as paleoenvironment, settlement and
subsistence, lithic and storage technology, mobility patterns, craft specialization, technology,
refinement of relative obsidian hydration dating chronology, thermoluminescence dating, and
instrumental neutron activation analysis.

[107] SYMPOSIUM • STEWARDSHIP: PROMISES AND PERILS
(Sponsored by SAA Ethics Committee)
Stewardship is the first principle enshrined in SAA‘s code of ethics. But what is the archaeology of
this concept? How does it apply to academic, CRM, museum and indigenous practice? Does it,
like `heritage,‘ potentially mask issues of ownership and power? Can it foster useful connections
with other disciplines? Ever since William Morris and John Ruskin desired to counter the
Industrial Revolution‘s ecological devastation, the notion of a `commons‘ has influenced our
notions of responsibility towards nature and culture. How does the war in Iraq and Kennewick
dispute help us realize the promise and perils of this concept?

of field and laboratory differentiation. They are separate and discrete; yet overlap at certain times
genetically and in terms of petrography and chemical characteristics. This poses problems in

differentiating their extraction, quarrying techniques, manufacturing technology, provenance, and
use (such as mining tools and groundstone). The session addresses issues of the origin and
genetic aspects of quartz veins, quartzites, and mylonitic rocks. In this session, special attention
is given to field relations, mining technology, as well as petrographic, petrofabric, and chemical
characterization.
[110] SYMPOSIUM • FORMULATION OF HERITAGE IN OVERTLY POLITICIZED ENVIRONMENTS
The process of archaeology-based heritage formulation is frequently a political action. As such,
the archaeological record is appropriated in various ways to promote, advance, and achieve
political goals. When such processes occur in overtly politicized environments, the political stakes
are high and the costs for engagement are significant because of consequences that far
transcend the boundaries of academia. The session will explore dynamic models that are
inherent to the process, while emphasizing origin and agents of change, both from outside and
within groups.
[111] SYMPOSIUM • UNRAVELING THE BOUNDARY: PERISHABLE TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS AND
BETWEEN THE PREHISTORIC GREAT BASIN AND SOUTHWEST
(Sponsored by SAA Fiber Perishables Interest Group)
Fiber-based technologies are culturally sensitive and thus offer an opportunity to examine social
change through time and space and to clarify shifting cultural boundaries. Significant numbers of
perishables have been recovered from sites in the Great Basin and Southwest cultural provinces.
Despite their proximity, archaeologists in one region often are not aware of current research in
the other. This becomes an issue when examining material culture along the porous border that
separates the two. This symposium considers recent research exploring issues of technology,
chronology and identity to stimulate discussion of social interaction across the Great basin -
Southwest boundary.
[112] SYMPOSIUM • CAVES AND SETTLEMENT: THE SOCIO-RELIGIOUS CONTEXT OF MESOAMERICAN
CAVE USE
The development of a self-conscious sub-discipline of cave archaeology over the last decade has
led to more robust discussions of social, political and religious ideology in ancient Mesoamerican
societies. As purely ceremonial contexts, caves are ideal laboratories for examining social and
political relations, which are often celebrated in or contested through ritual. This session brings
together the latest cave research and related ritual studies in which the interpretative focus is
clearly on the wider social context in which the activities occurred.
[113] ARCHAEOLOGY AND PUBLIC EDUCATION: FIFTEEN YEARS OF RESEARCH AND RESULTS
(Sponsored by SAA Public Education Committee)
Archaeologists have long educated the interested public and school children alike about their
profession. The past 15 years, however, have witnessed a dramatic increase in programming as
archaeologists struggle to instill the stewardship ethic with ever dwindling resources. Significantly,
evaluation and research have helped us improve mature education programs. Public education
now helps shape archaeological research itself and the presentation of results. The symposium
will examine the history of archaeology education, the research and evaluation behind
programming, and the emergence of archaeology education as a viable subdiscipline.
[114] SYMPOSIUM • INTERSECTIONS AND EXCHANGES: THEORY AND PRACTICE IN CULTURE CONTACT
RESEARCH
'Culture contact' archaeology emerged during the Columbian Quincentenary as an alternative
framework for archaeological studies of colonization and its outcomes. Today, culture contact
archaeology has expanded to encompass a widespread range of intersections and exchanges
between different cultures. Culture contact research also forges intersections and exchanges
among scholars by challenging the divide between historic and prehistoric archaeology, by
fostering interdisciplinary bridges between archaeology and other fields, and by encouraging
dialogue and collaboration among archaeologists and native peoples. Through diverse
presentations ranging from focused case-studies to theoretical queries, this symposium explores
current research on 'culture contact' in archaeology.

[119] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY, HISTORICAL ECOLOGY, AND HUMAN IMPACTS ON MARINE
ENVIRONMENTS
Archaeologists, ecologists, and other researchers have emphasized the importance of
archaeology in understanding ancient environmental change, human impacts on biological
communities, and the management of natural ecosystems. Numerous studies have used
archaeological data to document human-induced environmental changes in terrestrial
landscapes, but few have examined such processes in marine ecosystems, although coastlines
often supported dense and relatively complex human populations. This session uses
archaeological and historical case studies from well-studied coastal areas around the world to
provide a deeper understanding of human impacts on marine ecosystems, the management of
marine fisheries, and other current environmental issues.
[120] SYMPOSIUM • A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA-POLYNESIAN NEXUS?
While the prevailing orthodoxy of North American archaeology discourages theories of
transoceanic cultural diffusion, we consider in this session linguistic and archaeological evidence
for direct cultural contact between Polynesia and southern California during the prehistoric era.
Words used to refer to the distinctive sewn-plank canoe used by the Chumash and Gabrielino of
southern California appear to correlate with Proto-Central Eastern Polynesian terms associated
with woodworking and canoe construction. Archaeological findings suggest the appearance of
sewn-plank boat construction was coeval with punctuated adaptive change and
technological/stylistic shifts in southern California and a period of major Polynesian exploration.
These ideas will be evaluated by a series of Polynesian and American specialists.
[121] SYMPOSIUM • MACROEVOLUTION AND ARCHAEOLOGY: CONCEPTS AND APPLICATIONS
Archaeology is the only academic discipline able to offer a comprehensive understanding of the
human cultural experience from earliest to contemporary times. Yet, it still lacks a fully integrated
evolutionary model that can provide insight into stability and change on all scales. This
symposium seeks to explore concepts and models that permit the expansion of a Darwinian
evolutionary approach to archaeology that includes the study of macroevolutionary scale change.
Participants provide case studies that examine the differential persistence of cultural entities on
multiple scales through time and across space. Concepts of reductionism, emergence, Bauplan,
cladogenesis, and punctuated equilibria are explored.

(Sponsored by SAA Committee on Government Archaeology)
A century ago the first national United States law for the protection of archaeological resources
was enacted after nearly three decades of struggle (1879-1906). Two generations of advocates
labored for the public protection and oversight of the treatment of American archaeological
resources. Understanding the cultural, economic, and political factors that influenced the
individuals and organizations engaged in development of the law provides a foundation for
evaluating its effects during the 20th century. Examination of the historical context will illuminate
how different interests were served and others ignored or surpassed by the law and policies
embedded in its provisions.

rivalry among top-ranked social units and individuals. This area also stands out for its informative
art style and excellent preservation of organic remains. A ten-year research program centered on
the site of Cerro Juan Díaz, on the Pacific coast, has contributed much new information about

1600. On the one hand these archaeological data add substance to a topic that has traditionally
depended heavily on ethnohistoric accounts and, on the other hand, they call into question some
widely accepted hypotheses that pertain to the organization of ritual and social units and to local,
regional and long-distance social networks.

[125] SYMPOSIUM • A STEPPE BEYOND: ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE EASTERN STEPPES
This session will bring together scholars involved in current research on and around the Eastern
Steppes of Eurasia. Presentations will center on Early Pastoralism and the Emergence of
Nomadic Complexity. Emphasis will be placed on new field work, theory, models and
multidisciplinary research.
[126] FORUM • ARCHAEOLOGY AS A PROCESS: PROCESSUALISM AND ITS PROGENY
Processual archaeology produced what many today view as mainstream archaeology. Along the
way, alternative approaches arose to challenge processualism-behavioral archaeology, human
behavioral ecology, evolutionary archaeology, and postprocessualism among them. Besides
being interesting in its own right, what does the history of American archaeology from roughly
1960 onward tell us about archaeology as a process? What does it tell us about the coalitions
and alliances, the cooperation and competition, that drive any discipline? How do the formation of
research groups and the social and intellectual interactions among them help or hinder which
theories become accepted? Panelists in the forum, all of whom have played integral roles in
setting the agenda for American archaeology, will draw on their personal involvement to address
these and related questions posed by a group of panelists and the audience.
[127] SYMPOSIUM • THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMATEURS/AVOCATIONALS TO ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE
PURPOSE OF THE COUNCIL OF AFFILIATED SOCIETIES
(Sponsored by SAA Council of Affiliated Societies)
Amateurs work with professionals in training programs, certification programs, stewardship
programs, and in other innovative ways. But what has the SAA done to meet one of its By-laws
objectives: to serve as a bond among those interested in American Archaeology, both
professional and nonprofessional, and to aid in directing their efforts into scientific channels. One
thing it has done is to establish the Council of Affiliated Societies: to ... benefit all societies in this
field and to advance the practice of archaeology. Discussion at the end of the papers will revolve
around how action can be breathed into this wishy-washy statement.
[128] SYMPOSIUM • THE PRECERAMIC IN THE NORTE CHICO: NEW TECHNIQUES FOR SURVEY,
EXCAVATION AND ANALYSIS
The Norte Chico region of Peru has proved to be the center of the earliest monumental
construction in the New World during the Preceramic period (3000-1800 BC). Application of GIS
along with detailed recovery and recording methods has enhanced the number of sites identified,
the accuracy of recording, and brings out critical details in the materials analyzed. This session
presents results from research over the past three field seasons.
[129] SYMPOSIUM • PLANNING, PRODUCTION, POWER, AND PYROTECHNICS: RECENT RESEARCH IN THE
CACAULAPA AND CHAMELECON VALLEYS, NORTHWESTERN HONDURAS
Recent research in the Cacaulapa and Chamelecon valleys has greatly increased our
understanding of the interplay among spatial patterning, ceramic, lithic, and copper production,
and power in the region, addressing questions of identity and political organization. Excavation
data from the centers of Las Canoas, El Coyote, and 11 rural settlements in their surrounding
area, whose occupation extends from the Middle Preclassic period (800-400 B.C.) to historic
times, combine to suggest how architecture and craft production-including a likely precolumbian
copper workshop-were manipulated in shifting strategies of domination and affiliation.

[130] SYMPOSIUM • CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS IN ZOOARCHAEOLOGY
Zooarchaeology became established as an important field of study within archaeology during the
latter decades of the 20th century. The purpose of this symposium is to allow the 21st century's
first generation of zooarchaeologists, whether they be presenters or audience members, to share
ideas about the future of zooarchaeological research questions and methodologies. Each of the
papers presented addresses a line of inquiry that the author believes will lead to substantive
advances in our understanding of the human past. Audience involvement in discussions about
the future of zooarchaeology will be encouraged during the session.
[131] SYMPOSIUM • CHACOAN PERIOD COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT IN THE ZUNI AREA
During the Chacoan Period the Zuni area experienced a rise in population with a greater
dispersion of peoples throughout the area as expressed by an increase in archaeological sites
from this time period. The expansion may be linked to improved climatic conditions that enhanced
opportunities for horticulture in previously marginal zones. Other explanations tie it to the rise and
structure of the social/ceremonial organization that developed in Chaco Canyon. This session
explores the nature of the community development from AD 1050 to AD 1150 from a variety of
perspectives, such as household organization, ecology, gender, migration, and regional
interaction.
[132] SYMPOSIUM • THE PRACTICE OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN MEXICO: INSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS AND
SCIENTIFIC RESULTS
(Sponsored by The Board of Directors of the Society for American Archaeology and Instituto
Nacional de Anthropologia e Historia)
The purpose of this symposium is to offer American archaeologists an overview of current
procedures and regulations applicable to undertaking projects in Mexico. It also addresses the
most important contemporary problems in Mexican archaeology today. The symposium—
organized by SAA and INAH—will be presented by several representatives from Mexico‘s
National Institute of Anthropology and History‘s Council of Archaeology, recognizing the
importance of assisting foreign archaeologists to follow the legal norms which define the
development of archaeological projects in Mexico.

[134] SYMPOSIUM • THE PROBLEM OF THE 'INVISIBLE' MAYA: REVISITING THE EVIDENCE FOR
PREHISPANIC MAYA INVISIBLE SETTLEMENT
The existence of invisible Maya settlement is acknowledged as a potentially serious problem in
Maya archaeology. Because of practical difficulties in locating evidence of invisible settlement,
this settlement category, although it may be substantial, has not been systematically integrated
into commonly accepted Maya settlement interpretations. Despite difficulties, some Maya
scholars have persisted in efforts to examine the character, significance and extent of such
remains. This session addresses the history of invisible settlement studies and presents current
research using both traditional and innovative methodologies at a variety of sites. The research
presented provides exciting approaches and promising directives for future efforts.
[135] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM • ACROSS THE GREAT DIVIDE: ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL AND
ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON CERAMIC ASSEMBLAGE FORMATION
Ceramic ethnoarchaeology's impact on the analysis of prehistoric assemblages has been
restrained. Ethnoarchaeologists think their work is ignored by prehistoric archaeologists who, in
turn, complain that it is difficult to apply ethnoarchaeological "findings" because they focus, for
example, on whole pots rather than sherds. Hence, both groups are frustrated by the Great
Divide - a chasm of ignorance that thwarts a broad understanding of the origins and interpretive
potential of ceramic assemblage variability. With scholars whose ceramic research embraces
these topics, this symposium seeks to establish common analytical ground and identify
opportunities to narrow the Great Divide between ethnoarchaeological observations and
archaeological practices.

Although it is a variable expression of hunter-forager theories of being, it played an important role
in the daily lived experience of prehistoric peoples. This session explores the archaeological and
landscape contexts in which rock art is situated, and the ways in which these provide an
informing context for understanding the social and economic routines associated with it. The
papers presented here illustrate the ways in which the archaeological study of rock art can
address issues of cultural process, identity construction, and territoriality.

(Sponsored by SAA Government Affairs Committee)
When archaeological sites become victim to vandalism, protection becomes a matter of
successful prosecution of perpetrators to deter future looting and seek punishment for crimes and
restitution for damages. The session begins with the history of ARPA from one of its drafters, Don
Fowler, and then presents case stories by the archaeologists and lawyers who have served as
ARPA warriors. Part two offers papers on the forensic valuation of archaeological resources, and
part three provides tools for prosecutors in the criminal, civil and international arenas.
[139] SYMPOSIUM • THE FOUNDATIONS OF SOUTHWEST COMMUNITIES: VARIATION AND CHANGE IN
PITHOUSE VILLAGES BETWEEN A.D. 200-900
This symposium explores fundamental questions about variation and change in pithouse villages
throughout the American Southwest. What is the significance of intra- and inter-site variability in
architecture, site structure, and settlement distribution for understanding the organization of
production, and socio-political structure between A.D. 200 and 900? What are the means of
secular and ritual integration in the formation and development of these early communities? Are
there continuities in the organization of Southwestern communities despite the shift in vernacular
architecture that began at end of the first millennium A.D? These questions are addressed
through regional summaries and thematic papers.
[140] SYMPOSIUM • LINKING THE PRESENT TO THE PAST: RECENT STUDIES IN FORAGER AND FARMER
ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by SAA Program Committee)
For the last few decades, ethnoarchaeology has been and continues to be a useful and important
tool for deciphering the archaeological record. While many early studies were largely descriptive
and atheoretical, recent ethnoarchaeological research is attempting to move beyond
particularistic characterizations to construct more useful models and theoretically driven
questions. These studies allow researchers to address 'big picture' issues and to ask different
types of questions about material remains. This session brings together recent research on
forager and farmer ethnoarchaeology from around the world that address questions about
settlement, technology, and subsistence.

CULTURAL LANDSCAPES IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
Current pre- and early historic research in Southeast Asia is altering long-held perceptions of
cultural development in the region. New advances in spatial analysis, paleoenvironmental
reconstruction and archaeometallurgy will each be discussed in relation to specific problems of
the Bronze Age to medieval Angkorian periods. Emphasis will be placed on the utility of
combining these fields, specifically, the role of paleoenvironmental analysis in providing temporal
anchors for deciphering the order of spatial patterning.

used to clarify the role of feasting and ceremonies or trade and tribute, and can inform us about
gender relations and site hierarchy. This symposium will showcase current research of "third
generation" paleoenthobotanists and archaeobotanists while exploring plant use as it relates to
differential resource access.

[147] SYMPOSIUM • STEALING THE PAST: PRESS COVERAGE OF ILLICIT ARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by SAA Media Relations Committee)
Every year unrecoverable archaeological information is lost to looters, pot hunters and
scavengers. Legal or illegal, the loss of artifacts and their provenience continues. As
archaeologists we know this, but how does the media - newspapers, magazines, TV and the
Internet - treat these events. Is diving on the Titanic good science? Is scavenging Spanish
Galleons an acceptable sport? Is the trade in art and artifacts good practice? Does media
coverage glorify these activities or does it help to quash them? Papers will review the coverage of
a variety of illicit activities and their impacts.
[148] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM • SQUARING THE SPHERES: INTERREGIONAL PERSPECTIVES ON
POSTCLASSIC MAYA CERAMICS
Type-variety classification encourages different type names for Postclassic Maya ceramics that
are similar at various sites, making it difficult to compare assemblages. Chronological
relationships between various Postclassic ceramic spheres are still unclear, and there are
difficulties in comparing ceramics from different zones of the Maya world and its periphery.
Participants will present well-known Postclassic ceramics from sites where they work, compare
these to similar ceramics elsewhere, and assess the best methods for presenting these
comparisons. We will critically evaluate type-variety classification in the assessment of
interregional interaction and the chronological alignment of ceramics from around the Maya world
and beyond.
[149] SYMPOSIUM • FORMATIVE PERIOD SOCIAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN
MEXICO
The Formative period in Mesoamerica (c.1600-100 BC) spans some of the most significant social
transformations of prehistory, beginning with the establishment of the first sedentary villages and
ending with the development of more complex regional polities on the cusp of state formation and
urbanization in the Classic period. This symposium will examine recent research on regional
trends and site-specific investigations in central and western Mexico, areas often overlooked for
their apparent lack of contact with the Olmec sphere early in the Formative and overshadowed in
the Late and Terminal Formative by later Classic developments.
[150] SYMPOSIUM • LITHIC REDUCTION ANALYSIS AND PROBLEMS OF PREHISTORY
The session being proposed is a venue for current research on lithic reduction strategies, and the
larger cultural implications of choices made by early lithic artisans, as a means of furthering our
understanding of the prehistoric past. It is an opportunity to explore the potential of reduction
studies as a means to broader interpretive ends, rather than just an analytical end in and of itself.
By expanding our concepts and methods we stand a much greater chance of refining our
perceptions about past cultural dynamics and the people that drove them.

The contributions of this symposium review and synthesize the cultural transformations that mark
the transition from Paleoindian to Archaic societies in North America. This event, often viewed
from a continental perspective, represents the first major cultural shift that took place solely in the
Americas and sets the stage for the unique developments of cultural complexity that distinguish
later North American prehistoric societies. These papers, placed on local scales but with regional
perspectives, review how societies adapted to the dramatically changing environmental and
cultural landscapes that occurred at the end of the Pleistocene and the early portion of the
Holocene.

wider ideological impact of such general research frameworks. Concepts like identity, agency,
individuality etc. are often applied indiscriminately to many places and times. The result is a
powerful de-historicizing process that suggests the universal relevance of contemporary theories.
However, theories are always created in a wider socio-economic reality. More importantly, they
are driven by and legitimize political interests located outside of academia. Papers in this session
will investigate this relation between theories and the interests they serve, and how theories
express and conceal such interests.

instrumental figure in the development of cultural resource management, nonprofit archaeology,
and public outreach in the Southwest. He is a preeminent Chaco scholar whose research has
seminally enhanced our understanding of Chaco Canyon and its environment. In this session, we
draw together colleagues from all venues of Gwinn's professional life to honor his contributions to

problems and progress in meeting this goal in light of panelists' personal research experiences.
The ensuing audience discussions will focus on central issues such as how and when specialists
should be integrated into archaeological research projects, what drives archaeometric research,
and how to prepare students for careers in archaeological science or for effective communication

Households represent a fundamental aspect of research on prehistoric Southwestern societies.
Approaches to prehistoric households vary, but often involve examining site lay-out, architectural
features, and artifact assemblages to address a diverse array of topics, including social
organization, mobility, and ethnicity. In this symposium, participants use these same kinds of data
to discuss how women, men, and children within these households lived and interacted.
Examples from across the Southwest are presented. By taking a gendered approach, we hope to

[159] SYMPOSIUM • SPHERE OF INFLUENCE: FIFTY YEARS OF INTERPRETING LOWLAND MAYA
CERAMICS IN THE SHADOW OF THE UAXACTUN REPORT
In the 50 years since R.E. Smith‘s Ceramic Sequence at Uaxactun, Guatemala, his work has
become synonymous with the lowland Maya ceramic sphere. "Chicanel" and "Tzakol" for
example, provide definitions approaching dictionary-level accuracy for archaeologists. While
Smith‘s insights have stood the test of time, the cultural landscape has increased in temporal and
spatial complexity due to new research. This session puts our present knowledge of lowland
Maya ceramics into historical context, framed against Smith‘s seminal work.

symposium presents results of ongoing work at the site. High-precision mapping, excavations,
materials analyses, architectural spatial analyses and dating, GIS survey, conservation, and other
research efforts have provided significant new data on Chavin‘s construction, chronology, and
function, as well as its relationships with surrounding settlements, its highland landscape, and
other sites. These data in turn provide insight into the growth of authority at Chavin and
processes of emerging social complexity during the Andean formative period.

Until recently, early colonial (seventeenth-eighteenth century) Southwestern animal use was little
investigated. Studies now coming to fruition shed light on the earliest phases of contact between
the indigenous peoples of New Mexico and Arizona and Spanish colonial populations. Papers in
this symposium focus on both indigenous and colonial faunal utilization. They document the ways
in which local ecology, pre-colonial hunting practices, cultural and economic variability, and
history of missionization interacted to produce continuity and change in indigenous faunal
utilization among Pueblo and Piman populations, and the degree to which colonial people
adhered to European foodways.

The aim of this symposium is to present state-of-the-art data on the prehistoric use of obsidian in
the Pacific Rim regions, with a focus on long-distance exchange networks as direct evidences of
contacts and migrations since the Upper Palaeolithic (ca. 30,000 years ago). Main topics are: a)
geochemical characterization of major obsidian sources; b) patterns of obsidian use in the

[164] SYMPOSIUM • APPLICATION OF CAOS IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Measurement of specimen and/or artifact morphology is a critical component of archaeological
analysis. Historically this measurement has been done using hand-held instruments.
Computerized smart-vision systems (Computer-Assisted Optical Stereology/CAOS) offer
enhanced measurement capability. In addition to measuring standard dimensions such as length,
width, and thickness, they can also measure shape parameters. Large numbers of specimens
can be measured quickly and efficiently. The papers comprising this symposium demonstrate the
utility and effectiveness computerized smart-vision systems in a variety of archaeological
analyses.

2005 is the 15th anniversary of the passage of NAGPRA, perhaps the most important and
controversial legislation for US archaeology. There is no British law comparable to NAGPRA.
Britain recently produced the Palmer Report, which calls for the clarification of the standing of
human remains in British museum collections, and recommends that the UK enact law setting
appropriate policy and procedures. This session will examine continuing issues surrounding
human remains, combining a 15-year review of aspects of NAGPRA with accounts from Britain
on the Palmer Report and responses to the Report with speakers from the US, Britain, and
Australia.

Twenty-five years of research in Honduras' Ulua valley have produced new understandings of
social dynamics of the eastern Maya Lowlands from before 1600 BC to the colonial period. This
session explores how residents of multiple independent settlements used household-made
objects to negotiate social relations within and extending outside the valley. Technical analyses
are used to ground interpretations that link practices on the level of the individual, the house, and
the town. The reproduction of practices over time and their transformations are viewed as
products of local decision-making that consistently maintained regional heterarchy in response to
changing conditions.

[23] Hohokam Buff Ware Provenance and Its Implications for Sedentary Period Pottery
Economics
Following a decade of geological sampling, petrographic analysis, and petrofacies modeling in
the Phoenix Basin, Arizona, the provenance of Hohokam red-on-buff pottery is now being
determined. For this paper, the temper constituents were analyzed in nearly 1,000 sherds from
four widely separated sites in the lower Salt River valley. The results implied remarkably
concentrated ceramic production in the Snaketown/Gila Butte/Maricopa Road portion of the
middle Gila River valley. This finding is consistent with the sophisticated division of labor for
pottery manufacture during the Sedentary period as previously inferred based on similar analyses
of plain ware specimens.

[109] Quartz, What it Is, What it Isn't, What it Should Be: A View from the South Atlantic Slope
The use of quartz by prehistoric people for the construction of stone tools is well documented in
the literature. Yet for many archaeologists the nature of quartz, and a basic understanding of its
use as a raw material for tool production, remains enigmatic. Quartz use has frequently been
relegated to the realm of expedience without more detailed attention given to its place in the
general lithic landscape. This paper will discuss quartz use on the South Atlantic Slope in light of
recent research in the Southeast. This research suggests that quartz use is far more complex and
structured than previously thought. Suggestions will be made regarding how to bring quartz into
the main stream of lithic studies.

[143] A Dated Sequence of Flotation-Derived Subsistence Data from Lyon’s Bluff (22OK520)
This preliminary assessment of plant food production at the Lyon‘s Bluff mound and village site is
based on flotation-derived subsistence data from radiocarbon-dated contexts (A.D. 1200 - A.D.
1650). An abundance of both domesticated and wild resources is documented. Given the site‘s
location on east central Mississippi‘s Black Prairie, intensive cultivation of small-seeded native
grains is not predicted. However, recently published field notes and maps from Moreau
Chambers‘ 1935 excavations at Lyon‘s Bluff indicate the presence of "charred grain masses." I
evaluate the presence and significance of native starchy seeds at Lyon‘s Bluff in light of the
current paleoethnobotanical data.

[140] Ethnoarchaeology of the Evenki hunters of Northern Transbaikalia, Russia
This ethnoarchaeological study of a small Evenki group in central Siberia addresses questions
about subsistence. Zooarchaeologists, using modern, ethnoarchaeological studies as analogues
to reconstruct past behavior assume two things: that a link between hunting and/or butchery
behavior and archaeological material remains exist; and that environmental and anatomical
constraints overwhelm cultural and behavioral variables, or specifically that anatomy dictates
butchery pattern. The hunting and butchery practices of this group were studied with these
questions in mind. The link between behavior and material remains is explored through the study
of butchery behavior and surface modification, using a GIS image-analysis approach.

rare examples of LIP architecture outside these defensive structures. This research report will
present the results of the artifact analysis, elaborating on earlier Collao ceramic and architectural

Early texts have long asserted that India‘s southwestern Malabar Coast was a key participant in
the maritime trade networks of the Indian Ocean during the Early Historic period (200 BC-AD

supposed to have thrived along the coast. However, a newly discovered site in the coastal Kerala
town of Pattanam has yielded material evidence suggesting the presence of a substantial Early
Historic urban settlement which, if confirmed, will be a major contribution toward understanding
early South Indian socio-economic development and Indian Ocean inter-regional interactions.

[116] Inferring the Significance of the Movement of Manos and Metates in the Maya Lowlands
Manos and metates held great significance for the Classic Maya and were more than just
utilitarian items. Archaeological evidence taken from a variety of contexts suggests that manos
and metates were extensively utilized in rituals. Moreover, excavations and provenance studies
conducted in the Maya Mountains not only support the important ritual role that manos and
metates played but suggest that the movement of manos and metates among different
communities was also important to the inhabitants of the communities. This paper will focus on
how we might be able to infer what the movement of manos and metates meant for Classic Maya
in different geographical contexts.

The ancient Hopi village of Chevelon was occupied for a century until the late 1300s and exhibits
extensive burning among its 500 rooms. Traditionally, archaeologists have attributed burning to
accident, violence, or ritual, unable to resolve the problem of equifinality. Arizona State Museum
has spent three years mapping and excavating at Chevelon. Our research has revealed
considerable variability in the presence of burning. By collaborating with a professional fire and
arson investigator, this poster discusses the benefits of interdisciplinary research in developing
consistent methodology in the analysis of burning that will allow archaeologists to better choose
among causes.

Practitioners of different technological traditions who come into contact have the option of
adopting new technology, modifying their existing technology, or remaining constant with their
existing technology. Who takes on new technology and who remains committed to existing
technology? How are these choices manifested in the archaeological record? Variations in the
technological traditions of food grinding, axe hafting, and pot forming provide the background for
this discussion about gender and group identity. Identity differences are evaluated in three
diverse areas in Arizona: Point of Pines, Tonto Basin, and northeast of Flagstaff.

[62] The Open-Air Component of Middle Palaeolithic Mobility and Land Use in the Dmanisi
Region, Georgian Republic
Researchers recognize that open-air sites play a significant role in larger systems of hunter-
gatherer mobility and land use and that the failure to account for such sites can lead to acute
misconceptions. Mashavera Gorge 4 was excavated during 2004 and found to contain a series of
discrete, stratified Middle Palaeolithic occupations that provide the first regional data on the
location and function of logistical loci. Based on biostratigraphy and technological data we situate
MG4 within the late Middle Pleistocene. Data from this new excavation are presented and an
attempt is made to calibrate our current understanding of regional Neanderthal behavior.

[6] Collaborative Research with Indigenous Communities: Richard Ford's Legacy of Integrative
Research in the American Southwest
Richard I. Ford's career in anthropological archaeology has consistently conjoined ethnographic
and archaeological perspectives to deepen our appreciation of the links between past and
present. Even during the New Archaeology's full-frontal scientism, Ford melded oral historical,
archaeological and traditional knowledge in his work with indigenous groups in the American
Southwest. Equally as important has been Ford's mentoring for those of us who sought to employ
a similarly integrative approach in our research. This paper focuses on the means by which
indigenous and scientific communities conceptualize the idea of "cultural affiliation," research
derived in large part from discussions with Dick Ford over the past twenty years.

[111] The Mexican Connection: Another Look at "Perishable" Relationships between Mexico and
Points
For more than three decades, it has been clear that it is possible to distinguish a series of
prehistoric basket making "traditions" in Western North America, specifically including Mexico.
While the exact nature of these traditions remains controversial, virtually no one would deny the
existence of distinctive and long-lived regional perishable manufacturing trajectories with unique
suites of signature artifacts and definite frontiers. Perhaps some of the most intriguing aspects of
these entities are their interrelationships both in time and through time. This paper reexamines
the relationships between basket making and basket making populations in Mexico, the American
Southwest, and points further afield, and concludes that certain technologies of Mexican genesis
are introduced into the Southwest and elsewhere precisely at the time that a package of
domesticates of Mesoamerican origin are also spreading northward. The nature of both
dispersals is defined and examined in several scenarios are offered to "explain" these interrelated
processes.

[128] Analysis of Early Monumental Architecture in the Norte Chico: The Late Preceramic in the
Pativilca and Fortaleza Valleys
As part of an effort to better understand the archaeological landscape of the Norte Chico region
during the Late Preceramic (3000 to 1800 Cal. B.C.) 13 sites with monumental architecture were
tested in 2002 and 2003. The analysis of mound construction in context with their respective
dates permits an assessment of the sequence of occupation of the sites, the construction
patterns and a relative chronology of mounds. The data demonstrate that an unusual system of
relatively independent ceremonial centers developed in this region during the 3rd millennium B.C.

[54] Competition as a Political Tool
Competition in the form of a regulated physical confrontation of two teams enhances cultural and
factional cohesion not only of the players but of their supporters. We will discuss the case of the
ballgame in Classic period Central Veracruz, where we consider the game was used primarily as
a means to secure a following, embedded in a particular beheading ritual meant to legitimate and
consolidate the elite's position in society. In centralized entities, the ballgame seems to have
functioned to resolve conflicts between neighboring entities. In segmentary entities, on the other
hand, it was used to integrate the allied: lineages that always were potentially centrifugal
components. An iconographic classification of male figures places the ball players in the highest
ranks of sociopolitical tiers, including the depiction of reigning lords attired as such, a fact which
reinforces the ties of ballgame to power.

[114] Social Reorganization and the Cultural Impact of the Inca on the Middle Chillon Valley
This paper shows social and political changes in the central portion of the Chillon Valley at the
end of the Late Intermediate Period (ca. 1350-1450) as a result of the arrival of the Inca. This
cultural contact resulted in a reorganization of social space, sacred space and in systems of
economic production among the ethnic groups of the Quivi, Sapan, Macas, Guarabi and Colli who
occupied the lower and middle valley, as well affecting groups of the upper valley, the Canta and
Chaclla. The strategies of "vertical control" described by Murra (1975) and Dillehay (1987) are
examined in light of these data as cases of ecological complementarity in economic production.

[27] Double Ditch Village: Three Centuries of Community Change, AD 1450-1785
Tests at 40 locations integrated with geophysical data have yielded a remarkable record of
settlement change at Double Ditch Village, ND. The founding community - an 8-ha, TMM-style
village of 100+ houses - evolved over 300 years to ~32 earthlodges on 1.7 ha. Four (+?)
sequential fortification systems were used; temporally intermediate ones incorporated constructed
perimeter mounds. Occupants during the final 150 years stripped earth, houses, and trash from
the village interior in advance of lodge replacement cycles, perhaps in the aftermath of major
epidemics. Planar borrowing and environmental degradation along the shrinking village margin
obliterated all shallower traces of the founding settlement.

The Cumberland Gap National Historical Park is located at the juncture of Kentucky, Tennessee,

prehistoric occupations. As part of an Archaeological Overview and Assessment, a predictive
model was prepared using the ArcView GIS 3.x extension Weights of Evidence. This model used
slope, aspect, and distance to water as evidential themes and was tested by seven random and
three non-random 20-acre blocks. This testing found that geology played a major role in the
location of archaeological sites; therefore, the model was refined to included geology.

[35] Circular Surface Features of the Las Vegas Valley, Nevada
Rock rings and cleared circles are common surface features on fragile-pattern sites in the Mojave
and northwestern Sonoran deserts. These features are difficult to Interpret in functional terms:
Their circular form represents the simplest choice for any discrete, non-linear facility; their
construction is simple; and most lack depth and associated, functionally specific surface artifacts.
Some features do, however, yield significant excavation and pollen evidence. Furthermore,
patterning in the distribution of features, recognized at different spatial scales, can contribute to
the Interpretation of archaeological landscapes. These perspectives are applied to the population
of recorded features in southern Nevada's Las Vegas Valley.

[148] Type-Variety on Trial: Experiments in Classification and Meaning Using Ceramic
Assemblages from Lamanai, Belize
Ceramic typological classification has been delayed at Lamanai owing to concerns about the
limitations of using a single system, such as type-variety. Nonetheless, type-variety provides a
standard language for site-to-site ceramic comparison. To complement earlier contextual studies
of the ceramics, we decided to experiment with the independent implementation of at least three
separate kinds of classification based on type-variety, petrographic, and iconographic analyses.
In this way we hope to reveal the strengths and weaknesses of each method and suggest ways in
which each contributes to our knowledge of the social, cultural, and economic context of ceramic
consumption and production at Lamanai.

[128] Preceramic Diet During the Late Archaic Period in the Norte Chico Region of Peru
A wide variety of edible plant remains have been recovered from stratigraphic samples excavated
at Late Archaic (3000-1800 BC) sites in the lower valleys of the Pativilca and Fortaleza Rivers.
The importance of plant foods as a fundamental part of the diet during the developments of the
Late Archaic Period has been questioned by archaeologists who have focused on the importance
of marine resources. The present analysis indicates a wide variety of plant species were
consumed, including those with relatively high protein content, such as sweet potato, beans,
achira, and possibly maize. These data suggest that plant foods are likely to have been a
substantial component of the preceramic diet.

[68] Testing Ethnicity and Identity among the Yampara: Style, Kinship and Feasting Patterns in

The Yampara comprised a polity on the southeastern margins of the Inka empire in the

ethnohistorical and archaeological research as being multiethnic, forming ethnic archipelagos, as
long-distance trading groups, and as ambivalent ethnics that combined both Andean and
Amazonian traits. To test such ideas, this paper will explore the ways in which ethnicity and social
identity were expressed at regional and communal levels in Oroncota. Analysis will focus on the
contextual distribution of ceramic styles and prestige materials to illuminate the interplay of
ethnicity with kinship, production and feasting patterns.

[99] Renewal and Rectification in Andean Understandings of Death
Contemporary Andean understandings of death may illuminate aspects of the precolumbian
record. The self is not unitary but exists as an interactive complex of relationships of domination,
subservience and interdependence, an equilibrium lost during the gradual transition from life to
death. In the soul's liminal journey relationships of dominance and dependency are reversed, a
moral state of "equal and opposite reaction," necessary before the soul can attain a 'dry' state of
seminal neutrality. I relate this to Urton‘s discussion of Quechua mathematics as an 'art of
rectification,' and to Inka abstraction as a kind of 'moral geometry.'

[135] Ceramic Variability and Social Identity: Applying Insights from Ethnoarchaeology to
Iroquoian Pottery
Ethnoarchaeological research has provided many insights into understanding the causes of
ceramic variability in the archaeological record. Among these are those that focus on technical
choices and manufacturing processes in relation to social boundaries. The ability to examine
what was formerly termed function and style in. a more unified way through a consideration of
technological style provides new insight into the ways variability in ceramics relate to social and
group identities and the process of marking social boundaries (whether intentional or not).
Analysis of ceramics from two contemporary Seneca village sites provides a database within
which to apply results from these ethnoarchaeological studies. Patterns of technological variability
as evidenced in vessel morphology, construction, and decorative techniques are analyzed for
evidence of the use of material culture as an expression of social boundaries. While insights into
Iroquoian ceramic variability and its causes are gained, problems in identifying appropriate
interpretations remain and are discussed.

and low nitrogen isotope ratios of these C4 crops permit reconstruction of their proportions in
human and animal diets. Pigs and humans had similar carbon isotope ratios but different nitrogen
isotope ratios. Pigs were thus probably provisioned with millet fodder. Baijia humans had higher
collagen nitrogen and lower carbon isotope ratios, and higher apatite-collagen 13C spacings,
than those of Jiang Zhai people, indicating diets with more fish and C4 grains, and less pork.

measuring bifacial hand-axes or knives produce spurious results when used to measure retouch
amount on hafted bifaces used as cutting tools.

One of the most significant predictions of the bet hedging model is the implication that

relatively low variance of fitness, and will thus tend to persist in marginal environments. Testing
this prediction against archaeological data has been difficult. A substantial part of the difficulty
arises from the typological manner in which monumental architecture has been classified.
Developing a multivariate numerical classification system that is designed to investigate
evolutionary issues is a necessary prerequisite for expanding the application of evolutionary

household socio-economic status, and vessel uselife to determine ceramic assemblage formation
processes. The goal of this paper is to use the Gamo case study to indicate to archaeologists the
types of variation that may affect formation processes and population estimates based on their
ceramic assemblages.

[92] The Ubaid Expansion - Internal Development and Changing Identity
The Ubaid expansion represents the northern part of a pan-Mesopotamian process, in which
Halaf and Ubaid 0-2 societies transformed themselves into the more complex southern and
northern Ubaid 3-4 societies. These transformations involved changes in architecture, ceramics,
burial practices and settlement patterns. In the north, they occurred gradually and in some
regions incompletely, from middle and late Halaf into the northern Ubaid, in a way that strongly
implies that the transition resulted from the adoption of Ubaid cultural traits by northern
populations. This paper surveys the evidence for a gradual transition and considers some
explanatory models.

[164] Present Use and Unexploited Potential of Image Analysis in Anthracology
Anthracology has been used for some time in archaeology and paleoecology. Present use and
unexploited potential of image analysis in anthracology will be discussed, using examples from
North America, Europe and Africa and including: (1) Reconstructions of regional or local scale fire
history using microcharcoal (m) from lake or peat sediments; (2) Determination of past vegetation
composition and density or human fuel choice by anatomical identification of macrocharcoal (mm-
cm); and (3) Reconstruction of past climates by measuring width (or density) of growth rings or
other wood anatomy characters.

[47] From Balls in Baskets to Pots on the Fire
Cooking methods at the Neolithic site of Çatalhöyük, Turkey are presented, with a primary focus
on the apparent shift from indirect boiling using clay balls in earlier levels, to direct boiling using
pottery in later levels. Particular attention is placed on the transition from balls to pots, a time
when both would have been used for cooking in very visible rooftop settings. This paper explores
the ways that cooking practices during this transition were charged with strong symbolic meaning,
while also offering a means of signaling one‘s group or individual identity in a time of widespread
social and economic change.

[100] Archaeological Landscapes, Mentalités and National Ideals in 19th Century Greece
The role of archaeology in the process of nation building and the construction of national
identities are issues that have attracted significant attention in recent years. This paper reflects on
the changing research agenda of archaeology in 19th century Greece and the relation of the
discipline to evolving national ideals. These choices were clearly reflected in the physical
reorganization of the archaeological landscape from the 1830s on. The initial destruction of "post-
classical" remains, an attempt to eradicate the physical evidence of an "inferior" past, was
followed by their belated rediscovery, rehabilitation and incorporation into the national narrative.

[38] Servants of Two Masters: Ceramic Production at Las Canoas, NW Honduras, and Questions
of Regional Identity
Las Canoas, a 120-structure site on the Chamelecon between the Naco and Cacaulapa valleys,
was a center for red on naturally orange-brown pottery, with designs identical to red-on-tan
ceramics made in Naco. The distribution of redon-brown includes both valleys, both receiving
identical products in the Classic. By the Terminal Classic, the valleys were receiving products
differing in paste composition and designs: Naco vessels remained the same; Cacaulapa ones
had less-well-prepared pastes, and did not carry the distinctive Naco bird. Thus one group of
producers met the needs of two polities, maintaining dual allegiances, from the Classic through
Early Postclassic.

Western Cape Province, South Africa
In the early 1980s, Graham Avery excavated bones and artifacts on a paleosurface at EFTN
HD2, at the northern end of the famous Elandsfontein (Hopefield) Acheulean site, 90 km north of
Cape Town, South Africa. The mammal species and Acheulean artifacts imply a mid-Pleistocene
age. None of the bones is conspicuously cut-marked. Carnivore chew marks are more obvious,
and hyena coprolites are abundant suggesting a complex, multi-component occurrence. HD2
recalls other bone-artifact occurrences at Elandsfontein and at the nearby Acheulean site of
Duinefontein 2. The sum supports the suggestion that Acheulean people had limited impact on
the large mammals with which their artifacts are often associated.

[86] The Ties That Bind: Connecting Women through the Ages
In bridging the gap between feminist social theory and static archaeological remains, one line of
insight has yet to be fully utilized, that of the interpretative voice of women, outside the academy,
who live and labor in areas of archaeological interest. These voiceless women have ties and
connections to the women of the past, through their oral traditions, their daily routines and
activities, and the landscape they share with their predecessors. One small effort to listen to the
women of a small Jordanian community illustrates how these connections can enliven the
archaeological facts with gendered meanings that span millennia.

A study of approximately 300 seals positions the lower Ulua Valley within a Mesoamerica-wide
tradition of Formative period material practices. Middle Formative seals from Puerto Escondido
and Playa de los Muertos exhibit similar construction and motifs to contemporary seals from
Chiapas, the Gulf Coast and the Valley of Mexico. However, these objects are strikingly different
from seals found elsewhere in Honduras. The use of seals, most likely to mark the body, linked
residents of early Ulua villages to a larger cultural idiom while simultaneously differentiating them
from neighboring regions.

storage behavior in prehistoric villages in the project area. It is based on the study of a large
database of excavated Formative habitations and field houses, identified as Fremont and Virgin
Anasazi. Comparing the materials and design of storage facilities reveals significant differences in
storage technology and storage capacity between northern and southern settlements, reflecting
systemic differences. Trends in the organization of storage throughout the Formative are

[27] Hearth Life: An Acutalistic Examination of Post-depositional Processes on Upland Hunter-

Thermal features are universally ubiquitous and frequently archaeologically encountered
components of hunter-gatherer campsites. On the Southern High Plains, prehistoric hunter-
gatherer camps and thermal features appear to be positioned preferentially in upland locations
such as along the rims of the drainage system. These upland settings generally are low-energy
depositional environments. Actualistic experimental research has been undertaken in order to
understand further the post-depositional morphological processes effecting a simulated
abandoned camp area. Results indicate that while the thermal feature underwent significant
morphological transformation, little variability was detected in the spatial locations of the
surrounding "artifact" scatter.

[127] A Month of Sundays: Lessons Learned from the Meyer Site Excavations, Southwestern
Indiana
Professional opinions regarding amateur archaeological societies generally follow one of two
lines of thought. Some believe professional involvement with such groups represents a form of
public service, where professionals do all the giving and amateurs reap all the benefits. Others
look upon amateurs as a source of free labor, where professionals are the principal recipients at
the cost of volunteers. Both of these are one-sided, and neither is particularly satisfying. Today's
professional-amateur alliances should be more appropriately described as partnerships. This
paper addresses this issue through recent experiences of the Falls of the Ohio Archaeological
Society at the Meyer Site.

[50] Soil Resources of the Ancient Maya in the Parque Nacional Sierra del Lacandon, Guatemala
Ancient Maya agricultural practices in the Usumacinta River Basin of Guatemala varied over time
and space during 2000 years of settlement. To learn more about these practices, soil profiles
were sampled during the 2004 season of the Sierra del Lacandon Regional Archaeology Project,
following a transect, between the Classic period settlements of Esmeralda and Tecolote. This
transect crossed dramatic topographic changes as well as ancient political boundaries between
the kingdoms of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. The authors analyzed physical and chemical
properties of the soils and the stable carbon isotope ratios that indicate C4 crop cultivation. The
data suggest that maize was cultivated extensively but not uniformly.

[63] The Block 49 Cemetery: Evidence of Nineteenth-Century Mormon Mortuary Practices
Salvage excavations at the Block 49 Pioneer Cemetery in Salt Lake City presented a unique
opportunity to examine nineteenth-century Mormon mortuary practices as reflected by the earliest
cemetery in Utah. Complete excavation of all identifiable burials in the cemetery allowed a
population-level examination of both mortuary practices and the osteobiology of the emigrant
group which founded Salt Lake City. Data from the cemetery demonstrate that Mormon burial
practices during this period reflect both the changing patterns in contemporaneous mortuary
behavior in nineteenth-century American culture, as well as some behaviors unique to the
Mormon subculture.

[130] Stable carbon isotope evidence for winter feeding on seaweed in the Neolithic of Scotland
Seaweed foddering is documented over the past fourteen centuries in Northwestern Europe.
Tooth enamel stable isotope analysis shows that modern seaweed-eating sheep from North-
Ronaldsay Island have high delta 13C from feeding on seaweed, and low seasonal amplitude
delta 18O possibly from ingesting oceanic water. Analyses of Scottish Neolithic sites show that at
the Knap of Howar, 3600 BC, sheep and cattle grazed only terrestrial plants. At the Holm of Papa
Westray, ca 3000 BC, sheep consumed fresh seaweed during the winter. These data suggest
that the physiologically specialized adaptation to a seaweed diet began by 3000BC.

[81] Composite Assemblages vs. "Mixed Deposits:" A New Look at the Preclassic in the Northern
Maya Lowlands
Conventional wisdom regarding Middle Preclassic and earlier ceramic assemblages from the
Maya lowlands holds these to be typologically monolithic entities difficult to chronologically facet
or otherwise subdivide and opaque as to their possible ethnic or linguistic associations. Through
a meticulously fine-grained analysis of such collections from the Belize Valley, the author has
shown this to be untrue and has presented an approach for penetrating their accepted
ethnocultural "inscrutability." This paper applies a similar approach to newly recovered Middle
Preclassic collections from central Campeche to reveal the likely multicultural complexities
underlying later Classic era traditions of the Northern Maya Lowlands.

[164] Morphometric Analysis of Wild and Domestic Banana Phytoliths
Banana was apparently first domesticated in Papua New Guinea and the surrounding areas.
Domesticated varieties were subsequently introduced into other tropical areas. Phytolith analysis
may prove to be an efficient tool to document the spread of banana and its accompanying culture.
As Musa accuminata and M. balbisiana are the two species basic to banana domestication,
analysis of their phytoliths constitutes a first step towards the development of algorithms for
interpreting banana phytoliths recovered from archaeological contexts. This contribution reports a
first attempt using computer-assisted image and statistical analysis to discriminate between
phytoliths extracted from Musa accuminata and M. balbisiana based on their morphometries
(measurements of size and/or shape).

[110] Politicizing the Philistines
Few ancient peoples have been as politicized throughout history as the Philistines. Recently, for
example, their memory has been pressed into service by both Palestinian and Israeli nationalism.
Noting the similarity in names, some Palestinians see in the Philistines their distant ancestors, a
lineage that stakes a claim to primacy in the land. Archaeological excavations, however, clearly
indicate that the Philistine material culture is Aegean in origin, a feature frequently noted by pro-
Israeli advocates. It is paradoxical, then, that like-minded editorialists utilize the biblical trope of
the ancient Philistine to demonize the modern Palestinian.

This paper presents results of the application of geophysical techniques in March of 2004 to
delimit deeply buried occupational surfaces and features at the early Olmec site of Canton
Corralito, in the Mazatan region. of coastal Chiapas, Mexico. Because of local environmental

accident through well-digging activity. Sections of the site were mapped with georadar,
magnetometry, and resistivity. Some of identified anomalies and surfaces were checked for
ground truth a month later through deep and extensive excavations. These showed that the radar
had indeed identified occupational surfaces accurately two meters below the current surface.

[43] The Transition from Foraging to Farming in the Rainforests of Island Southeast Asia: The
Evidence of the Niah Caves, Sarawak
The traditional thesis for the beginnings of farming in Island Southeast Asia is that Austronosian-
speaking farmers spread southwards from Taiwan (and ultimately the Chinese mainland) c.4000
years ago, bringing rice and livestock with them. Another theory is that indigenous foragers began
to cultivate forest foods earlier in the Holocene, and/or that rice and pigs were first used as status
rather than staple foods. The paper discusses the light thrown on those various scenarios by
evidence from new investigations in and around the Niah Caves situated in the lowland
rainforests of Sarawak (Malaysian Borneo), including faunal and botanical remains within the
cave and palynological cores taken in the surrounding landscape.

For many American Indians, the practice of anthropology has been not only problematic but also
controversial. American Indians have cited a total absence of communication and sensitivity
exhibited by many anthropologists, most particularly archaeologists, as the major sources of
conflict. Furthermore, it can be argued, anthropologists often present their conclusions in a
manner that has little or no relevance to the people being examined. This paper will illustrate the
importance of repatriation and "indigenous archaeology" to anthropological practice and how they
as applied methodologies can work to address the "disconnect" of anthropological practice from
those communities and cultures it studies.

[88] Early Paleoarchaic Point Morphology and Chronology
Paleoarchaic culture history is poorly constrained, limited by inadequacies of projectile point
typology and radiocarbon dating. This is especially true of fluted points, presumed to mark the
earliest human occupancy of the region. We recently raised questions concerning whether Great
Basin fluted points and those of Clovis affiliation are contemporaneous and if projectile points of
stemmed morphologies are comparably ancient. Current data suggest that Great Basin fluted
points persist later than the Clovis interval and may undergo systematic morphological changes
as do fluted points in other North American regions. Here we present additional data and examine

[135] Midden Ceramic Assemblage Formation: An Ethnoarchaeological Perspective
Archaeological middens provide large samples of cooking and other household vessels, but how
do these samples relate to household vessel assemblages in use? The Kalinga
Ethnoarchaeological Project in 2001 focused on midden formation and the creation of midden
ceramic assemblages. Our study community was Dalupa, an upland village in the Pasil River
Valley, Kalinga Province, Philippines, with 380 residents. Specific research topics included the
association of middens with particular households, the representativeness of the midden sample,
and how the condition of midden sherds reflected midden formation and disturbance processes.
After summarizing our results, I discuss possible applications of our work.

[40] Faunal Analysis and Ethnohistory: Breathing New Life into Old Bones
The study of animal bones from archaeological sites has the potential to move beyond basic
evaluations of diet and environment towards issues that concern gender, social class, ethnicity,
and cultural identity. The kinds of foods people eat and the manner in which animals are
butchered and prepared are daily practices that leave tangible evidence in the form of faunal
remains that can be used to explore these issues for peoples in the past. This paper will discuss
the potential for zooarchaeology to inform our understanding of complex issues such as identity
and ethnicity through an example from the Great Lakes fur trade.

[46] Reconstructing Mississippian Diet in the American Bottom with Stable Isotope Ratios of Pot
Sherd Residues
Carbon and nitrogen isotopes of carbonized residues were analyzed from interior surfaces of 88
ceramic vessels from five contemporary early Mississippian American Bottom sites. Average
proportions of maize in upland Richland Complex sites ranged from 7% at a small rural
farmstead, to 17% to 42% at three larger sites. Sherds from the Cahokia sub-Mound 51 feasting
pit averaged 36% maize, even though macrobotanical remains of maize were very rare. Nitrogen
isotope ratios of eight sherds from Cahokia clearly show meat was cooked in one vessel.
Potsherd residue isotopic analysis provides a powerful tool for reconstructing dietary practices in
Eastern North America.

[13] The Southern Boundary of Mesoamerica during the Postclassic: A View from the Mosquito
Coast of Honduras
This paper focuses on the relationship between Postclassic populations in the Mosquito Coast of
Honduras, along the southern boundary of Mesoamerica, and their neighbors, including
Mesoamerican groups to the north and non-Mesoamerican cultures to the south. The Mosquito
Coast sits in the transitional area between that which is undeniably Mesoamerican and that which
is not, and patterns of material culture suggest a dynamic and complex relationship with both
areas. Recent research illuminates use by local elites of Mesoamerican templates of site planning
and public construction as a means of gaining and maintaining political power, while also utilizing
non-Mesoamerican elements common in Lower Central America. Here, the early Postdassic
Period is examined, when groups of the Mosquito Coast increased in size and complexity while
moving between Mesoamerican and non-Mesoamerican patterns of material culture.

[124] Differentiating the Dogs: Morphological and Ancient DNA Analysis of Canid Remains
The Engelbert Site, a large multicomponent (Archaic to Contact) site in New York State,
contained the remains of at least eight canids; two were recovered from features described as
dog burials, the others were fragmentary remains mixed with other faunal material, in feature fill.
Attempts to evaluate the potential for these remains to represent different species were
hampered by the highly fragmentary nature of the remains and, in some cases, significant
weathering. In addition to morphological analysis, a tooth from each canid was submitted for

[44] Where Did They Come From and Where Did They Go? Early Upper Palaeolithic
Developments in the Eastern Mediterranean
Notwithstanding the shift from flake to blade/let based industries, the early Upper Palaeolithic in
the Near East actually displays considerable evidence for continuity from the preceding local late
Middle Palaeolithic in terms of the lithic assemblages. This broadly parallels the behavioural
changes associated with modern humans, which also appear to be generally incremental.
Nevertheless, it seems that the somewhat later Levantine Aurignacian is intrusive to the area,
displaying many characteristics typical of the central and west European classic Aurignacian. In
this paper we discuss possible explanations of this phenomenon.

[153] Reflections on Ideology and Theory in Archaeology
Archaeologists create an image of the past from empirical observations that we transform into
meaningful, coherent narratives. This transformational process is theory driven. Our narratives
are always partial understandings that necessarily misrepresent the past. Ideology is at work in
the theory-based creation of these misrepresentations because it depicts specific interests as
general ones. Thus, theory as a generalizing mode of thought is inherently ideological. The
ideologies behind archaeological theories spring from socio-political contexts. A critique of the
ideology of theories implies both an investigation of the relationship between theories and societal
interests as well as their internal rules of misrepresentation.

Large, complex databases cannot be adequately comprehended with narrow methodologies and

greater integration of archaeofaunas with diverse datasets and theory, this paper introduces a
multicontextual technique for the analysis of multiple faunal assemblages. Utilizing a repeated
sequence of pattern recognition and systematics, multiple interpretative frameworks, or contexts,
are imbedded into the analysis. The reconstruction is therefore layered in the sense that each

Yet these dispersed populations produced an extremely homogeneous, rich and discrete material

[22] The Whole Feast: Both Zooarchaeological and Paleoethnobotanical Evidence for Ceremonial
Feasting at a Hohokam Community in the Tucson Basin
Evidence for ritual consumption of food is often hard to discern from the archaeological record.
This is especially true in areas where evidence for food consumption is scant. This paper will
analyze evidence for ritual food consumption at the Marana Platform Mound Site in southern
Arizona by comparing and contrasting food remains from the ceremonial center of the site with
food remains from residential contexts. This will be accomplished by utilizing a combination of the
zooarchaeological and paleoethnobotanical remains from the site in order to build a more
complete picture of prehistoric food strategies.

Canada
Relying upon data from the 2003 and 2004 excavations at the Bridge River site, this paper will
discuss changes in the faunal assemblage over time in correlation with environmental fluctuations
and radiocarbon dates from over fifty housepits. Determining when inhabitants of the Bridge River
site relied heavily on fishing activities versus hunting activities, can allow for a better
understanding of past environmental conditions as well as when and why "packed" communities
developed in the interior British Columbia region. The utility and manufacture of bone tools
recovered from the site will also be discussed.

[57] An Archaic East Polynesian Adze Workshop on Rurutu, Austral Islands
In 2003, an early East Polynesian site on the Austral island of Rurutu was excavated. Adze
manufacturing was the primary activity, with material quarried from at least four different sources
on the island. The site dates from the Archaic period (ca. A.D. 1000 - 1400), when a large amount
of long-distance trade took place in the region. Neighboring archipelagoes such as the Southern
Cooks and the Tuamotus, where quality basalt is scarce or nonexistent, would have needed
convenient sources for this vital raw material. This paper discusses the possibility that the
Australs were an export center for stone tools.

[149] Systems of Agricultural Terracing at the Formative Site of La Laguna, Mexico
It is common to date abandoned features of the agricultural landscape by association with surface
scatters of sherds. The underlying assumptions are tested at La Laguna, a Terminal Formative
settlement with remains of several superimposed systems of terracing of different morphologies:
earthen berms, steps cut into the subsoil, stone risers, etc. Excavation of terrace fill proves that
few of the features visible on the surface date to the Formative, while others are the product of
farming in Postclassic, Colonial or modern periods. Alluvia deposited downstream from the site
offer further insights into the multiple cycles of terrace construction and abandonment.

[20] Postcolonial Theory and Indigenous Movements in Maya Archaeology
Archaeology has traditionally played an important role in constructing history, which in western
contexts has been strongly tied to the nation-state. Postcolonial theory has made possible
alternative histories that cross-cut ethnic and national boundaries and draw on different
epistemological traditions. Here we examine postcolonial theory and the construction of
archaeological histories in the Maya area, where indigenous movements have strongly influenced
the implementation of postcolonial theory. We suggest that Maya archaeology must develop a
robust theoretical base that acknowledges and incorporates key components of postcolonial
theory arising out of the social context in which it is practiced.

[145] Social Differentiation or Not? A Case Study from the Neolithic Site of Opovo in Serbia
Social differentiation has become an increasingly popular topic in archaeology, including
paleoethnobotany. Plant remains have often been used as evidence for social hierarchy. In the
case of plant remains from the late Neolithic site of Opovo in Serbia, the differences in plant
distribution observed among features, mostly pits, are consequences of various taphonomic
processes and different plant processing activity areas rather than of social stratification. The
people are not necessarily stratified along all the aspects of their lives, including the access to the
vegetable food that they ate.

In the Southern Plains and surrounding areas the transformations that mark the shift from
Paleoindian to Archaic societies occurred over a 2500-year period beginning at the end of the
Pleistocene (9500 Cal BC). Various coping strategies occurred in response to rapidly changing
environments and resource availabilities. These changes were due to social experimentation
among increasingly diverse Early Holocene populations and can be monitored through variations
in subsistence, tool designs, and settlement/mobility patterns. By 7050 Cal BC the full set of
Archaic behaviors was achieved but the transformation was not a simple linear progression
throughout the region.

Zooarchaeological studies have begun to demonstrate the local impacts, both positive and

concept is that the search for Native American settlements should begin with a search for the
location of the natural resources exploited from those settlements. This approach necessitates
GIS mapping of the spatial distribution of plant and animal species economically important to
Native Americans. The location of archaeological sites is predicted by "mapping" functional site

This paper presents archaeological interpretations relating to seal hunting and the prehistory of
the indigenous Saami of northern coastal Sweden. Excavations of hut complexes witness
intensive ringed seal hunting during the period AD 500-1300. Saami ritual features, including a
bear grave and ring-shaped enclosures, place-names and artifact distributions, reflect their
relations to landscape features and waterways in this landscape. Radiocarbon dates of the
sealing huts, suggest that these people had been displaced from the coastal zone by a Swedish
population in the early 14th century. Stone labyrinths, interpreted as Christian symbols in this
context, mark the Swedish appropriation of the coastal landscape and, in some cases, the
overpowering of non-Christian features, including the sealers‘ huts and even older grave cairns.
These symbolic manifestations mirror the religious and land-use conflicts that took place at that
time and give new perspectives on the geography of the pre-reindeer herding Saami in northern
Sweden.

[145] Plant Use, Public Architecture, and Early Village Life on the Taraco Peninsula, Bolivia
During the Late Chiripa Period (800-250 BC) villages were established across the Taraco
Peninsula, Bolivia, each containing structures that are hypothesized to have served as public,
ritual spaces. Although distinct, these structures contain similar attributes, such as sunken courts
and engraved stonework. In this paper, we compare the plant remains from public structures at
two sites: Chiripa and Achachi Coa Collu. Comparison of plant remains from these structures
sheds light on the function of these spaces, as well as the role plant resources played in early
polity formation in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Peru and Bolivia.

[75] The Mt. Trumbull Prehistory Project
The Desert Research Institute, Nevada State College, and California State University Long Beach
are investigating the Virgin Anasazi occupation of Mt. Trumbull, NW Arizona. Prior largely
unsystematic inventories have revealed 400+ sites within about 240 mi2, including ~40 8-20 room
C-or- L-shaped pueblos. Human occupation appears densest during PH times as indicated by
surface ceramic collections. Many of these sites, located near 7,000 ft., are found on volcanically
derived soils, which cover 2/3 of the study area. This paper describes work on several sites
conducted in three seasons between 2001-2004.

[30] Technological Organization and Mobility in Central Brazil at Early Holocene
Several open-air lithic sites from Central Brazilian Plateau, dated between 9 and 10,500 yBP,
show considerable variability in terms of size, density, distribution and assemblage composition,
some formed through reoccupations. Most artifacts are unifacial, but a few bifacial ones also
appear. Different assemblages that respond to curated and expedient strategies characterize
technological organization. These features point to a regular occupation throughout large
territories and seem important to discuss the processes of settlement and adaptation of these first
populations to this vast and open country.

[76] Using Allometry to Investigate Energetic Constraints on Human Demography
All organisms are constrained by fundamental energetic principles that can be described with
allometric scaling relationships. These relationships also constrain human life histories and can
be used to link fertility rates with energy consumption. We briefly summarize these constraints,
outline the use of allometric scaling relationships to understand differences in energy budgets for
foragers and agriculturalists, investigate their influence on fertility rates, and explore further
evolutionary implications. Combining an energetic approach with recent research into human
demography demonstrates striking consistency in fertility rates across subsistence regimes and
suggests that changes in growth rates are largely a function of variation in mortality.

being produced locally in Chihuahua. If multiple production locations existed, there should be
small differences in mineralogy and technology visible in thin-sections of sherds from Paquimé

Evaluating Site-Use Hypotheses
Bonfire Shelter Bonebed 2 has long been recognized as the earliest bison jump site in North
America. Dibble and Lorrain‘s (1968) analysis concluded that the bison bone deposit,
representing an estimated 120 individuals, was the result of three separate bison jump kills by
Paleoindian hunters. Binford (1978) argued that skeletal element frequencies favored high utility
elements, suggesting a secondary processing area rather than a primary kill locus. This analysis
finds that Bonebed 2 is, indeed, likely a single secondary processing area where the high fat
utility elements of 24-27 bison were transported and butchered.

mammoth and identify the range of handling times and encounter rates within which mammoth
specialization might occur. Our results cast doubt on the model of Early Paleoindians as
mammoth or megafauna specialists, suggest hunters should have taken a range of small and
medium size animals as well, and agree with recently published reviews of the late Pleistocene

of interpreting the process of settlement of the continent. Unfortunately, few analytical methods
exist that effectively use genetic data to explore the process behind the patterns. Here we employ
a computer simulation approach to test different settlement process models with the available
genetic data (mitochondrial and Y chromosome DNA). The simulations take into account both the
demography of small-scale populations and the effects of long-term biological processes on these
populations.

Age sites near the Dead Sea suggests that 1.) gross osteological preservation holds little direct
correlation with collagen preservation, and 2.) archaeologists should pursue alternate methods in
conjunction with stable isotope analysis of bone collagen to offset differential preservation in
semi-arid environments.

This model and these data point to methods that can be used to determine whether variability in

human subsistence, rather than simply about variability in fragmentation rates.

While many earlier and not a few contemporary treatments of the Paleoindian/Early Archaic
Transition in the Northeast often stress clear-cut macro or quantum changes in climate with

some elements like the fluting of projectile points deleted and others added. Overall, however,
there is no profound "signature" to the Paleoindian/Early Archaic Transition in this region.

tempered with sand from the Salt Lake area. Some Late Prehistoric wares are tempered with
coarse, angular, alluvial sand temper of mineralic composition from metagranite sources 10-12
kilometers away. Volcanic-tempered Late Prehistoric sherds may originate in the Traverse
Mountains--provenance cannot be established without further sampling, but the closest sources
are at least 30 kilometers away. In all cases sources appear to be non-local to the studied sites.

[48] Interaction, Symbolic Conflict, and Social Identity in the Salinas Pueblo District
In the Salinas Pueblo District of New Mexico, the formation of group identities prior to the rise of
nucleated settlements of the Classic period (1300-1600 A.D.) remains poorly understood. I use
neutron activation analysis to reconstruct networks of interaction among emerging groups in
Salinas over the course of the Coalition period (1100-1300 A.D.). INAA data for both local and
non-local ceramics, in concert with stylistic, settlement, and ritual landscape data, are used to
argue that dispersed and then early aggregated groups pursued multiple strategies of symbolic
conflict to build identities, including exchange and the emulation and appropriation of symbolic
capital.

[143] Regional and Intra-Site Settlement Patterns in the Chickasawhatchee Swamp
The Chickasawhatchee Swamp is a heterogeneous interior coastal plain landscape that
alternates between hardwood-dominated wetlands and long-leaf pine uplands. Although a
number of prehistoric mound centers were known here, none were well-documented, and little
complementary survey data existed prior to this year. A nine month regional survey documented
over 225 previously unrecorded sites, locating components dating from the Paleo-Indian through
Historic periods. Four significant sites, including two mound centers, were mapped and subjected
to limited testing. Preliminary analysis suggests that vegetation regimes and hydrology helped to
shape regional and intra-site settlement.

the Ancient Maya of Caracol, Belize
The ancient Maya of Caracol, Belize integrated the dead and the living in their households. A
specific building in each residential group usually was dedicated to mortuary ritual and housed
the important dead. The social compact between the living and the dead could be altered through
tomb re-entries. Archaeological signatures suggest that while some re-entries were accidental,
others were purposeful and transformational, designed to re-define the relationships being the

Craft production as related to political economy impacts how different modes of culture contact
manifest themselves in the archaeological record. An interruption in the political economy of the
Andes began in the period following Spanish conquest, when the inhabitants of the region lived
without direct control by the Incas or the Spanish for 40 years. This transition out of standardized
Imperial Inca pottery impacted both decorative style and technology, as is evident in the forms,

[8] Making Places for Life and Death: Early Bronze Age Settlements and Cemeteries on the
Southeastern Dead Sea Plain, Jordan
The Early Bronze Age (c. 3600-2000 BCE) of the southern Levant involved wide-scale population
aggregation into fortified settlements, accompanied by the intensification of agricultural
production, use of community-wide storage, increasing social complexity at personal and polity
levels, and the transformation of social and geographic landscapes. These changes have been
documented on the southeastern Dead Sea Plain of Jordan, in the settlements of Bab edh-Dhra'

Rooted in ideas about social memory and place, this paper discusses how EBA people

[44] The Upper Palaeolithic Hiatus in Northwestern Africa
In Africa west of Egypt and north of the Sahara, there are gaps in the Upper Palaeolithic. The
early Upper Palaeolithic occurs in Libya - the Dabban - but is followed by a gap of perhaps twenty
millennia. In the Maghreb, there was a hiatus of many millennia between the Middle Palaeolithic
and the Late Palaeolithic Iberomaurusian, which was apparently a recolonisation from the east.
These gaps may result from the isolation of northwestern Africa by the extreme aridity of most of
the Last Glaciation. They also allowed southern Iberia to be a final refugium for the Neandertals.

Valley have revealed that marine shell production was widespread during this early time period
and that marine shell may have served as a prestige item for emerging elites. Emerging elites set
themselves apart by accumulating prestige items such as marine shell. This paper examines the
role of marine shell production and its implications of rising complexity at the site of Blackman
Eddy during the Early and Middle Preclassic time periods.

[4] Variation in Isotopic Diet among Prehistoric Fijians
Oceanic archaeologists often make assumptions about the relative importance of marine and
terrestrial resources in prehistoric diets. One way to address these assumptions is through
chemical analysis of archaeological human bones and potential dietary resources. Here, we
present stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios for collagen from humans and associated fauna
from the Yasawa Islands and the Sigatoka Valley of Viti Levu, Fiji. The samples, from burial and
midden contexts, date from the colonization of Fiji (750 BC) to the eve of western contact (AD
1650). Our preliminary results indicate significant geographic and temporal variation in diet
among prehistoric Fijians.

[47] Barley and the state in Early Mesopotamia: A commodity chain analysis
This presentation examines the social organization around bringing barley from field to table in
mid- to late-third millennium BCE Mesopotamia. Barley was a staple and its preparation involved
activities, agents, and implements which together constitute the "barley commodity chain." The
organization of this chain maintained a few people at high standard of living and condemned
many others to toil and debt. The Mesopotamian social organization around barley thus
constituted a tool of hegemony. By examining the procurement of a staple as a necessary stage
of food preparation, I seek to expand the dialogue about the political aspects of cooking.

Upper Forks of the Gila
Although the Upper Forks of the Gila in southwestern New Mexico are considered part of the
Mimbres Mogollon region, they are an archaeological terra incognita due to the paucity of
systematic excavations. LA 6538, a primarily Georgetown phase pithouse village, was excavated
in 1966, but the data were never analyzed. Initial research findings provide a new temporal
perspective on the architectural sequence bridging the transition between the Early and Late
Pithouse periods in the Mimbres region, while the red-slipped, basket-impressed and smudged
ceramics indicate a variability not reported at Georgetown phase sites in the Mimbres Valley or

[93] Toolstone Acquisition: Simulation Experiments
Hypotheses concerning the organization of subsistence activities are often tested with data on

Elsewhere, I have explored this issue using rank-order analysis; here, I explore it with simulation
experiments, using raw material occurrence distributions and a random walk model to generate
expectations for the null model. The results help strengthen our ability to test the null hypothesis
that toolstone acquisition reflects toolstone distributions and nothing more.

[151] Diagnostic Artifact Distributions as Indicators of Hunter-gatherer Adaptations on the
Southern Plains Periphery, Paleoindian to European Contact Times
Diagnostic artifact types, primarily projectile points, occur in twenty two brief "style intervals"
during the long hunter-gatherer record of Central Texas. Patterns in the distributions of these
types in various environmental zones beyond Central Texas vary with changes in paleoclimatic
conditions. During xeric intervals, distributions tend to be restricted to better-watered
environments whereas in mesic intervals, distributions are more expansive and include evidence
for big game hunting.

[122] Cultural Extermination and Archaeological Protection: Native Americans and the
Development of the Antiquities Act of 1906
In the late 19th century, while advocates garnered support for a law protecting America's
archaeological resources, the United States government was seeking to dispossess Native
Americans of traditional lands and eradicate native languages and cultural practices. That the
government should safeguard Indian heritage in one way while simultaneously enacting ruinous
policies of cultural annihilation deserves close scrutiny, and may provide insights into the ways in
which archaeology is drawn into complex socio-political processes. Focusing on the Southwest,
this paper aims to further contextualize the Antiquities Act of 1906 by exploring what was
happening in American Indian communities during its development.

[18] One Thousand Years of Cultural Development at La Tiza, Nasca, Peru
The large site of La Tiza in the Nasca Valley was inhabited from the late Formative through the
Late Intermediate Period (200BC- AD1400). Spanning over 1000 years, this location has one of
the longest occupations in the drainage. Recent investigations highlight changes in domestic life
and mortuary practices over time. These include an initial settlement in the late Formative
followed by domestic use and extensive cemeteries during the Nasca Culture. Subsequently,
Middle Horizon terraces and tombs were constructed. The last use of La Tiza was in the Late
Intermediate Period and it then appears to be abandoned at the Inca conquest.

[109] Bedrock Hammerstone Quarries in Cambrian-Ordovician Quartzites along the Eastern
Shore of Lake Champlain
Five chert-bearing carbonate units, capped by three quartz-sand sequences, comprise the
Cambrian-Ordovician succession of the Champlain Valley, New York. All three quartz-sand
sequences are proximal to prehistoric quarries developed in the chert horizons. Impact objects,
picks, wedges, and beaked hammerstones, mapped at the chert quarries, are fashioned from the
quartzite sandstone. The quartz sandstone is quarried to produce mining instruments that were
utilized at the chert quarries, despite the presence of Precambrian glacial erratics on the
landscape. The stratigraphic and structural characteristics of the chert-bearing dolomites are
interpreted as requiring mining tools of a specialized rheology, which the quartzite provides.

substantial post-Chavín geological activity. Through improved understanding of these two
processes, we are developing a sense of the temple landscape of Chavín.

mundane taxa, such as lizards, species that were not used for food, i.e., dogs and "special"
animals such as felines, boobies and predatory birds. The spatial distribution of macaw bones
suggests a special use. I discuss how these disparate distributions relate to regional animal
communities and human effects upon them in pre-Columbian times.

main methods through which style was maintained, but it was also the avenue to taste change, by
which styles were updated and changed.

patterns - the most probable refits from the pool of possible matches. A surface lithic scatter is
used as a test-site for the model, showing the method‘s advantages and disadvantages.

Western Pueblo traditions appear not only in the style and content of the paintings but also in the

however, are also apparent in the art, suggesting that Pottery Mound inhabitants deliberately
incorporated elements of both the foreign style and a local one. By the time the extant murals
were painted, migrant groups, assuming they were the carriers of the foreign traits, had been
assimilated into a society that expressed itself as a unique blend of East and West.

Zea mays cob phytolith sizes record growing conditions, making this the ultimate environmental

phytolith shape is closely controlled lay genetics, providing a signature of the genetics and
lineage of archaeological maize. Archaeoclimatic models identify past times when maize could

[104] Maximizing the Value of Older Collections: Excavations in the Stacks at the Museum of
Indian Arts and Culture, New Mexico
Reports, site files, and older artifact collections from five Classic Period sites on Bureau of Land
Management property in the northern Rio Grande of New Mexico were systematically searched to
unearth samples useful in analyzing the production and exchange of Biscuit ware and micaceous
culinary ware. Two unreported and never inventoried collections possessed excellent research
potential. Three others contained sufficient material for in-depth compositional and technological
analysis. Ceramics from these sites, collected between 1951 and 1992, will add greatly to
understanding of production specialization in the northern Rio Grande Classic, without the need
for additional excavation or surface collection.

[49] Food for the Dead, Cuisine of the Living: Mortuary Food Offerings in the Jequetepeque
Valley, Peru
This study, which examines food offerings in Lambayeque burials at Farfán, Jequetepeque
Valley, Perú, moves beyond reconstructing diet to consider how food is manipulated for social
and ritual purposes. Well-preserved botanical and faunal remains provide an archaeologically
visible snapshot of cuisine, revealing culturally informed choices of ingredients, preparations, and
culinary equipment. Comparison to food remains from burials and households at nearby
Pacatnamú and later materials at Farfán suggests that the foods and preparation methods
evident in these tombs represent a subset of daily cuisine, perhaps particularly symbolically or
ritually appropriate for inclusion as funerary offerings.

importance in contemporary Pueblo cosmology as places to communicate with a wide array of

likely represents an emergence point for the people of the Nancy Patterson site as well as a
pilgrimage shrine for surrounding communities. Work in progress indicates that middle shrines
are common features associated with influential sites.

[107] Recognition, Sovereignty and Struggle: Stewarding Cultural Resources on the Columbia
River
Federal archaeologists in the United States serve as "stewards" of cultural resources located on
federal property. Part of their role as stewards is to consult with the appropriate stakeholders,
which often includes local tribes. But what happens when both a federally recognized tribe and a
non-recognized tribe claim ownership of the site? Using the village site of Cathlapotle located
along the Columbia River as a case sample, this paper will explore how questions of federal tribal
recognition and sovereignty can dramatically complicate the already complicated realm of cultural
resource stewardship.

By working together, avocational and professional archaeologists can make exploring and
preserving local sites and information important to the public and their communities. By
approaching archaeology this way, we find that education is the greatest tool in promoting
preservation and stewardship.

[131] Community Development, Agricultural Expansion, and the Role of Village of the Great Kivas

of a southern expression of the Chacoan influence on the Colorado Plateau, the site is poorly
understood in terms of its local context in the Zuni region. Recent survey in the area of Village of
the Great Kivas, reanalysis of Roberts‘ work, and comparisons with other regional expressions
places the site in a community context of social networks tied to a rain-fed agricultural expansion
of the economic system.

The Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 (ARPA) imposes criminal penalties for
"knowingly" violating any of the statute's prohibited conduct provisions. Efforts to interpret and
apply ARPA's criminal intent element - knowledge - confirm the Supreme Court's observation that
"few areas of criminal law pose more difficulty than the proper definition of the mens rea [culpable

[48] Consumer-Producer Relations and Interethnic Economy of Nineteenth-Century Hispanic
Communities in the Lower Chama Valley, New Mexico
Reoccupation of the northern Rio Grande after 1750 ushered in a persistent cultural formation
known widely as Hispano Society. Aspects of Hispanic economy are examined through INAA of
micaceous ceramics from the Chama District. Rancho and plaza-town populations were primary
consumers of micaceous wares, while Jicarilla Apache and Pueblo pottery were producers.
Geochemical and stylistic clues, particularly raw clay source utilization patterns, identify the ethnic
background of producers and their relationship to non-Indian consumers. Two contrasting forms
of supply are recognized at Hispanic archaeological sites: direct supply by resident Jicarilla
producers and market supply by non-resident Pueblo and Hispanic producer-traders.

Since 1946 the history of the Chupicuaro cultural complex has known an agitated fate of
reversals and adjustments, concerning the question of origins, temporal placement and the role
attributed to local populations. Recently acquired knowledge within the Valley of Acambaro
permits a better understanding of different architectural expressions, both monumental and
domestic, and their evolution from the 6th century B.C. until the end of the Formative period. The
analysis of architecture allows us to reflect upon the origins of the population in the region, and on
the position of these populations in the cultural dynamics from central and western Mesoamerica.

Approximately 25 km of rugged coastline was investigated by a seven-person crew from the US,

archaeologists since Eric Holtved's excavations of Thule dwellings in the 1930s. We recorded
over 800 cultural features (e.g., sod houses, tent rings, meat caches, fox traps, kayak stands, and
graves), which spanned the entire period of human occupation in the High Arctic from around
2000 B.C. to historical and recent use of the area.

[137] Rock-Art as Shaman's Tools: Testing and Refining Landscape Symbolism Models in the
Klamath Basin
The landscape symbolism model was developed for studying Native American rock-art in the
Great Basin and far western North America. Grounded in indigenous people's perceptions of the
supernatural landscape, this model enables researchers to interpret rock-art in terms of ritual
behavior. In pre-historic times the Klamath Indians of Southern Oregon were connected to Great
Basin groups through trade, warfare, and resource acquisition. Klamath perceptions of the
supernatural world are very similar to those of their Great Basin neighbors, suggesting that the
landscape symbolism model will yield insights into that region's corpus of art. Preliminary
research appears to confirm this.

The quality and elaboration of the construction of residential structures is a simple and

K‘arana, a domestic area directly north of the monumental core of Tiwanaku, presents an
apparent exception to this rule where labor intensive stone-faced platforms serve as the base for
modestly built small residential structures. Reviewing previous models of residential form and
distribution at Tiwanaku period sites, this presentation addresses this apparent paradox and
presents an alternative residential form and pattern existing within the monumental core.

by analyzing the skeletal remains recovered from the cenote during the 1961 and 1968

such hypothesis. Nonetheless, the variety of skeletal marks encountered witness a large array of
perimortem and post-mortem rituals, as defleshing and dismemberment among the others, that
indicate that the ritual complex performed was much more sophisticated and not limited to tossing
in living individuals.

Palynological analyses in alliance with CO2, oxygen isotopic records and palaeobotanical data
are now shedding new evidence for the paleoenvironments of South America since the Last
Glacial Maximum, at ca. 20.000 years B.P. These data indicate that presently semi-arid, such as
the Brazilian caatinga, became extremely moist during glacial maxima, whereas drier conditions
occurred in areas which are presently relatively humid, such as parts of southern and
southeastern Brazil. Contrary to the Refuge Hypothesis proposals, large tracts of the Amazon
remained moist and forrested, whereas in eastern Brazilian Amazon as well as Colombia became
drier, as indicated by the replacement of forest by savanna. This presentation will provide an
overview of the current paleoenvironmental data for South America prior to and after the arrival of

Most domestic potters have a dedicated production area, which is composed of smaller

alongside, and share apace with, general domestic activities. Ethnoarchaeological information
from the Maya Highlands of Mexico and Cyprus is used to explore the potential variability in
ceramic production areas and their relationship to the formation of household ceramic
assemblages. It is argued here that ethnoarchaeological research can aid the identification of
domestic ceramic production in archaeological contexts.

The earliest archaeologically documented appearance of the piki complex occurs at the

cornbread, as well as on several other material and behavioral components, first appears about
AD 1260 at Homol‘ovi, becoming increasingly formalized through time. By considering the
development of the piki complex at Homol‘ovi through several gendered theoretical approaches -
as a technology, a gendered space, and a cuisine - I consider how piki affected the status and
power of women at Homol'ovi.

The Gary point is a Late Archaic dart point that exhibits an unusual amount of morphological

the effects of resharpening on shoulder-area form, and how the quality of the raw material used
plays a part in this variation.

Multiproxy analysis of marine cores located off Iberia and climatic modelling indicate that the

sea surface temperatures and an expansion of aridity over the peninsula. This led to the
desertification of the southern Iberia and the replacement of arboreal taxa by herbaceous in the
north. Archaeological data are consistent with the hypothesis that these abrupt ecological
changes may have determined a contraction of Neanderthal populations and the timing of their
extinction.

Deposits at Las Canoas produced two artifact classes pertinent to ceramic manufacturing. First

made from sherds, either opportunistically or deliberately. Most fall into several form classes:
triangles, circles, half- and quarter-circles, diamonds, and rectangles. Their edges show use
wear, and the deliberately made items include evidence of shaping by breaking and abrasion.
Similar tools found in lower frequencies at neighboring sites and in the Naco valley are also
associated with ceramic manufacturing.

[89] Implications of Stephen Wolfram's a New Kind of Science on Anthropological Simulation
Anthropological processes, for the most part, have evaded researchers‘ attempts to be easily
simulated using traditional mathematical methods. Stephen Wolfram proposes that the reason for
this is these processes‘ irreducible complexity, and I will attempt to explain what implications this
has on modeling of societies and their processes. Parallels will be drawn between cellular
automata and human behaviour, and the need for realistic models thereof.

las sepulturas del sitio arqueológico Cerro Juan Díaz (Funerary Complexity at the Central Pacific
of Panama: Anthropological Analysis of Skeletons from Burials at the Cerro Juan Díaz
Archaeological Site)
Cerro Juan Díaz ha proporcionado la mayor y mejor documentada muestra de esqueletos
humanos en Panamá. Las sepulturas que consideraré pertenecen a la fase funeraria más
antigua (cal 150-800 d.C.). Son nichos reutilizados que albergaban entierros secundarios
("paquetes") y osarios. A los infantes tempranos no se les daba tratamiento en "paquetes"
aunque debió establecerse un requisito específico de edad. Esqueletos de individuos de ambos
sexos y de infantes sugirieron que estas tumbas estuvieron reservadas a unidades familiares.
Las ofrendas halladas en ellas destacan por su cantidad y calidad proponiéndose que algunos
grupos de ajuares estuvieron relacionados con actividades específicas.
(Cerro Juan Díaz provides the best and largest documented sample of human skeletons for
Panama. The burials to be considered in this presentation are from the oldest funerary phase (cal
150-800 A.C.). They are from reutilized niches with secondary burials ("paquetes"/packages) and
ossaries. Young infants were not buried in "paquetes," a treatment that surely was related to age.
Skeletons of individuals from both sexes, as well as infants suggest that these burials were
reserved for family groups. Offerings found on these burials are characteristically abundant and of
good quality, and it is proposed that some groups of offerings were related to specific activities.)

[123] Plant Use at Cerro Juan Díaz and Neighborhoods Based on the Analysis of Plant Remains
and the Documentary Record
Plant remains found at Cerro Juan Díaz comprise carbonized macrofossils, starch grains and
phytoliths. Species diversity is very low with maize being, predictably, the most abundant taxon.
Colonial accounts vouch for the widespread use of other staple cultigens in the area, such as
manioc, and squash. We examine these data in the light of the pre-Columbian history of plant use
and agricultural development and discuss how plant remains can aid archaeologists in
reconstructing the range of activities that were carried out at this community.

[1] Recent Applications of Behavioral Ecology to Southern Arizona
In the last decade, the study of prehistoric human resource use in southern Arizona has produced
new insights concerning the introduction of crops to the Southwest prior to 1700 B.C., the
subsequent interval of farming that lasted for two millennia, and the rapid intensification and
primary dependence on crops that followed in the first millennium A.D. Key events include
episodes of maize improvement during the first millennium B.C. and the first millennium A.D., and
the introduction of ceramic storage vessels. The Classic Hohokam are enigmatic; diet breadth
increased despite the use of high quality crops, reversing a three millennium trend.

[139] Subsistence Economy Boundary Effects on Pithouse Period Social Organization
Prehistoric social, political and economic organization evolved in an economy driven by non-
industrial, subsistence farming based resource use. These phenomena interacted dynamically
and were free to take a variety of forms. They were, nevertheless, constrained by local productive
capacity. This paper reviews trends in pithouse period subsistence economies. Certain
conditions, such as kinship-based resource tenure, may be presumed extant at all times. Owing,
however, to limits imposed by production and demographic factors, extreme differences in social
status were unlikely to be generated primarily as a consequence of the monopolization or
cooption of material wealth or food.

[103] Structure, Function, and Dating of Cooking Features at the Bridge River Site
The Bridge River Site is a large housepit village in British Columbia with a large number of

likely used for the processing of animal and plant resources. One of the purposes of the Bridge
River project is to determine the structure, function, and date ranges of these cooking features. In
order to better interpret these features, modern earth ovens used by native people in the area
were excavated. The results of that excavation are compared to the prehistoric cooking features
in the village in order to assess relationships between the prehistoric and modern cooking
features.

For Mormons in the Great Basin West, building the City of Zion meant turning ideas about what
the heavenly city was supposed to be like into an actual place. A city had to be built that
effectively externalized Mormon beliefs concerning the nature of earthly perfection. This paper
uses the built environment of pre-railroad Salt Lake City (1847-1869) to explore Mormon
conceptualizations of the City of Zion. What got built during this period is crucial in understanding
both the structure of the Mormon city and the ideological system that brought it into being.

One of the hallmarks of empires is the sociopolitical, cultural, and environmental diversity of their

maintained and even intensified as imperial officials divided and consolidated the population into
recognizable and manageable administrative units. In the Collagua province of southwestern
Peru, colonial documents detail the existence of two ethnic groups and three administrative
divisions. Our recent survey and excavations reveal continuity in portable artifact media across
these divisions, but regional settlement data suggest discontinuities which partially coincide with

interpretation of the archaeology of the Kashaya landscape based on their traditional law of

while the world was being created, and places that need respect, all invoke narratives of identity

Furthermore, by simultaneously protecting the archaeological record and sacred narratives, we
believe our work is one example of post-colonial stewardship.

amenable to the highly-curated mobile toolkits usually envisioned by archaeologists, while basalt
technology is generally crudish and expedient. Obsidian is emphasized in Paleoarchaic mobility
studies, but basalt has unrealized potential to inform us about the local, logistical priorities of
people that pertain to the duration of their stays in individual basins. Basalt is uniquely suited to

Over the past 20 years it has come to be appreciated widely that evolutionary theory can explain
what have been traditionally thought of as cultural phenomena. This generalization of the
biological theory, while based on the simple realization that cultural phenomena are transmitted
phenomena that affect the fitness of the transmitters, is greatly complicated in application by the
investigator's own cultural system. The history of "waste" or "bet-hedging" in archaeology serves
to objectify these problems that affect both biological and archaeological applications. There are
no quick fixes when you "have met the enemy and he is us."

Prehistoric groups tended to invest more labor into structure and feature construction and to

possible, however, that similar investments might have occurred when sites were planned for
short-term, but frequently repeated occupations. Differentiating the differences in the two types of
anticipated occupation poses a challenge for archaeologists. Data from archaic sites in
southwestern Wyoming will be examined to determine whether such differentiation is possible.

used, therefore, raw material procurement is a central concern in lithic reduction analysis. The
assessment of technological skill and the recognition of lithic production concepts is often based
on refitting and experimentation carried out on high quality flint. The utilization of seemingly
inferior non-flint raw material types in the European Mesolithic is a neglected area of
investigation. The question central to the present research is: what is the nature of alternative
procurement strategies with regard to raw material quality in flint-scarce regions? Are lithic
analysts who ignore utilized non-flint raw material missing out on important information and fail to
recognize alternative procurement strategies? The results of a lithic reduction analysis of several
Mesolithic assemblages from south-eastern Norwegian upland and coastal sites suggest that
non-flint material was not explored merely due to necessity serving as a deficient replacement for
flint, but reflect a preferential, socially motivated selection.

[113] The SAA PEC: 15 Years of Contributions to the Profession of Archaeology
The past fifteen years have witnessed a change in attitude towards the inclusion of public
outreach and education. This change is evidenced through the expediential increase in public
oriented products sponsored through both cultural resource management and academia. Through
time, the laws have remained the same. Public interest has remained a constant. The change has
come from within the profession, from the agency managers, professors and consultants. Over
the past fifteen years, more than 200 individuals have served on the SAA's largest committee. In
this presentation, follow history through the individuals who have made change happen.

[50] Tools of the Trade? New Perspectives on Agave Processing in the Malpaso Valley, AD 500-
900
Macrobotanical analyses demonstrate that the prehispanic inhabitants of the Malpaso Valley
utilized Agave sp., although the organization of its production remains unclear. Other researchers
have established a link between Mesoamerican agave processing and "strangulated" scrapers.
We present a morphological analysis of such tools and examine their relative frequency in three
sites representing a range of social contexts in the Malpaso Valley. Considered also in the
valley‘s larger paleoecological context, these lines of evidence yield new insights about agave
production at various levels of the valley‘s social hierarchy.

[139] Pithouses in the Pines, Early Sinagua Settlement in Northern Arizona
This paper examines early pithouse settlements in the northern Sinagua area around Flagstaff,
Arizona. Because they are deeply buried or covered by Sunset Crater cinders, sites from this
period are poorly known, having been found fortuitously, either through construction or when
excavating later components. This indicates that early pithouse sites are underrepresented in the
archaeological record. Archaeological evidence also suggests that village formation here may be
later, and the sites smaller, than in surrounding regions, due in part to the harshness of the
climate, but also due to differences in social organization and subsistence and settlement
systems.

[114] A Case Study for Culture Contact in a Prehistoric European Setting: Evidence and
Implications for Contact Regionally and Extra-regionally from Northeast Greece
Archaeologists have used "comparanda" frequently to infer a link--culture contact of some kind--
from one site to another and from one region to the "outside." The data come from artifact sets
such as pottery, figurines, etc. or on the evidence of trade based on identification of raw materials
not native to the region. The latter might be flint from Bulgaria transformed into tools in the
assemblage of a Greek site indicating trade/exchange and certainly culture contact. Such contact
will be examined based on the data from Sitagroi, a middle neolithic to early bronze age
settlement mound (ca 5500-2300 BC) in northeast Greece, used as the case study.

[67] Shamans on the Edge
The onset of Mississippian lifeways about A.D. 1000 are generally believed to have lead to the
institutionalization of many political and religious practices. In massive centers like Cahokia I have
demonstrated that distinctive priestly cults are recognizable in the specialized temple architecture
and a rich religious iconography. However, in the small village chiefdoms that lie in Cahokia's
northern hinterland, priestly cults are absent or poorly documented. Instead shamanistic practices
continue to play a pervasive role in local religious and political activities, these activities can be
observed in evidence from mortuary and village excavations as well as from iconography and
arts.

Animals are natural resources - acquired, stored, exchanged, modified, and used - and as such
can provide clues to domestic economies. Faunal remains and organic residues from households
at the Classic Maya sites of Motul de San Jose polity (including the sites of Buena Vista and
Trinidad among others) are used to reconstruct a picture of the economics of ancient Maya
animal-use practices. Taxonomy, skeletal element distributions, age characteristics, and
specimen modification details are compared between households and sites to reveal community

Most faunal research from the few excavated caves in eastern Beringia address questions of
large mammal taphonomy or the timing of human entry into the New World. Temporal changes in
species composition are an under-utilized source of paleoenvironmental information throughout

assemblage. Shifts in relative percentages of indicator species are noted correlating with major
vegetation changes from the late Pleistocene through the Holocene as well as those associated
with cultural occupations.

[62] Faunal exploitation at the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary at Pincevent, France
Occupation of several levels of Pincevent by Magdalenians during the Tardiglacial permits us to
observe changes in adaptation across the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary. Most notable was a
shift from almost exclusive hunting of reindeer to relatively equal proportions of horse and
reindeer. Examination of patterns of carcass exploitation and season of occupation contributes to
an understanding of the nature of this evolutionary change within the same cultural group at the
same site. These patterns of hunting and carcass treatment can be linked to changes in
technological and social behavior.

[128] Preliminary Data from the Archaeological Complex of Acaray, a Fortified Settlement in the
Huaura Valley, Peru
Little is known of the nature of interactions between late Prehispanic societies on the near north
coast of Peru. This paper reviews spatial and surface data collected at the archaeological
complex of Acaray in the Huaura Valley that suggest there was conflict between groups in the
region during the Late Intermediate Period (ca. A.D. 1000-1470). Recent investigations at Acaray
identified architectural features and surface materials that indicate a clear defensive nature to the
site and present evidence of warfare. I argue Acaray was the locus of violent interactions
between as yet undetermined groups, and briefly explore avenues for future research.

[106] More Than Just "Trianguloid:" Understanding Paleoindian Scraper Diversity and Typology
at the PaleoCrossing Site
Research into North American Paleoindian lithic technologies tends to focus on projectile point
analysis, often using projectile point diversity to determine geographical and/or temporal
boundaries. Larger components of Paleoindian lithic assemblages, such as scrapers, often get
divided into large, unwieldy categories such as 'unifacial,' 'bifacial,' or 'trianguloid.' The results of
this paper demonstrate the large diversity of Paleoindian scraper types from the PaleoCrossing
site by constructing an original Paleoindian scraper typology. This study introduces some
interesting and possibly diagnostic Paleoindian scraper types and application of this typology to
raw material usage has far-reaching implications for the occupational status of PaleoCrossing.

[119] Archaeology, Marine Ecology, and Human Impacts on Marine Environments
Contrary to long-standing anthropological theory, archaeological data now show that relatively
intensive coastal adaptations developed much earlier than once believed--by at least 125,000
years ago. With our oceans and marine fisheries in a state of crisis, coastal archaeological sites
contain a wealth of data on historical ecology and human impacts in marine ecosystems. In this
paper, we discuss: 1) linkages between archaeology, marine ecology, and fisheries management;
2) some methodological issues in comparing archaeological, historical, and ecological data; and
3) various approaches to understanding the history of human impacts to marine and other aquatic
environments.

[94] Sand Dunes and Site Structure: A Comparison of Archaic and Southern Paiute Campsites in
Southwestern Utah
Excavations at three sites in the Coral Canyon project area in southwestern Utah revealed Middle
and Late Archaic and Southern Paiute period sites. The patterns of site structure and artifact
assemblages show a rise in organization and complexity in later time periods. Sites from the
Middle Archaic (42Ws1219, 1221-early component) contain no habitation structures or ground
stone artifacts. Conversely, the more complex campsites from the Late Archaic and Southern
Paiute periods (42Ws1221-later component, 3636) contain both habitation structures and ground
stone. Comparative analysis indicates that this pattern is observable elsewhere in the region,
specifically at Sand Hollow.

[112] Preclassic Ritual Cave Termination Practices at the Site of Sabalam, Southeastern Peten
The 2004 California State University, Los Angeles Archaeological Project investigated a
Preclassic rural settlement in southeastern Peten called Sabalam. The complex of five mounds
each contained one or more caves. All of the caves investigated appear to have had their
entrances blocked in antiquity and a number of still blocked caves were noted but not
investigated. The project has interpreted this pattern, which was also noted at the nearby site of
Balam Na, as reflecting ritual cave termination. Our preliminary assessment is that Sabalam was
abandoned after this Late Preclassic event.

shedding new light on the birth and transformations of a Maya kingdom throughout the cycles of
Maya Preclassic and Classic civilizations. An improved survey methodology includes the recent
NASA AIRSAR radar mapping of the entire region in high detail providing a wealth of data to

[152] Theoretical Perspectives on Space and Place: Construction of Meaning in Mesoamerica
Appropriate spatial analysis requires an understanding of how a space becoming a place. In what
ways do people attach meaning to and organize space - or convert space into place? The way we
approach these questions affects and is affected by interpretation. Past people‘s sense of place is
perpetuated in the material remains of their culture. Archaeological settlement data from La Milpa,
Belize, supports the theoretical idea that the Maya actively participated, not only in converting
space into place, but converting mythical space into a coherent physical place by imposing a map
of their cosmos onto the landscape surrounding this center.

[35] Sacred Landscapes along the Lower Colorado River
The built environment along the Lower Colorado River reflects aspects of the cosmological and
socioeconomic lives of Yuman-speaking peoples. Many aspects of the natural landscape -
hilltops, ridges, unusual geological features (such as Pilot Knob), and even the waters of the
Colorado River itself - are imbued with symbolic and mythological meaning. Together the build
environment and natural landscape form a complex reflection of the many ways that Yuman-
speaking peoples interacted with the world around them. Based on archaeological survey data
and ethnographic studies, this paper highlights some of those aspects as they pertain to
traditional rituals such as the keruk (mourning) ceremony and to elements myths such as those
relating to the creation of the world.

[141] The Role of Aeolian Sediment in the Formation and Preservation of Archaeological Sites:
Collaborative Geo-archaeological Research in Grand Canyon, Arizona
Prior to construction of Glen Canyon Dam, aeolian processes played a significant role in the
formation and preservation of archaeological sites along the Colorado River in Grand Canyon.
With dam emplacement, the downstream sand supply was reduced more than 90%. The
diminished sand supply, in conjunction with other dam-operation effects, appears to be
contributing to erosion of archaeological sites in the river corridor. USGS scientists are
researching relationships between pre-dam site formation process, sand supply, and the role of
aeolian processes in stabilizing archaeological sites, with the intent of developing new
management strategies for maximizing site preservation under post-dam conditions.

The difficulty of obtaining direct evidence of communal small prey hunting in the archaeological

This paper is an analysis of a faunal assemblage produced by contemporary foragers in the
village of Ndele, Central African Republic. These duiker bones, and the detailed contextual
information that accompanies them, provide an excellent opportunity to further examine the
relationship between cooperative hunting, forager/farmer exchange, the resulting patterns of
skeletal representation, and potential applications of body part analyses toward identifying
communal small mammal procurement in the archaeological record.

and demographics over time, with male-centered burials increasing at Paloma and more juvenile
and young adults found in later occupations at Huaca Prieta. Household or lineage size varies
widely and reflects increased social inequality in the Preceramic.

sites constitute a continual network of human occupation, fitting each characteristic of the local
landscape. The Chupicuaro settlement pattern will be compared with contemporaneous examples
from Central and western Mexico.

[93] The Neolithic Settlement Landscape of the Southeastern Swabian Alb (Germany)
This poster presents goals, methods, and preliminary results of a collaborative project
investigating Neolithic settlement of the Swabian Alb limestone plateau region in southwestern
Germany. The project combines systematic survey of plowed fields and analysis of large private
collections to investigate site distributions on the plateau, which is largely poor in surface water
but a source of regionally important chert raw material. Comparisons of site locations in terms of
soil type, distance to water, and distance to chert sources show that numerous sites from the
Bandkeramik to the younger Neolithic are either associated with chert sources or high-quality
settlement locations.

[22] Object Lessons in Archaeoastronomy
Specific object lessons have emerged from the efforts of archaeoastronomers over the past three
decades. In this paper their work at three locations in the American Southwest is discussed. Two
of the settings (Casa Rinconada and Penasco Blanco) are in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico. The
third is at Wupatki Pueblo, Arizona. The lessons concern errors in inferences that stem from
readily identifiable sources. The incompleteness of site restoration records, overlooking pertinent
ethnographic data, and failure to examine crucial details of site restoration have been at the heart
of the problems.

[151] The Paleo-Archaic Transition and the Origins of Cultural Diversity in Cismontane California
From the shores of the Pacific to the crest of the Sierra, from the northern forests to the arid
south, California's diverse ecosystems were paralleled by an impressive array of native
inhabitants. The origins of this cultural mosaic can be traced to the regionally specific
archaeological assemblages that mark the earliest of California's cultures. Unlike other areas of
the continent, however, California lacks a clearly definable "Paleoindian" record. Instead the
earliest known cultures of Cismontane California are foragers who initiated the plant-intensive
economies that came to characterize all subsequent periods of California prehistory.

[55] Assessing the Significance of Late Neolithic Walled Sites in the Chengdu Plain
Late Neolithic walled sites have been identified near Chengdu since the discovery of Baodun in
1984. Presently, at least nine such sites are known in this region. The contemporaneity and
function of these enclosures is currently being debated, as is the role of these sites in the
development of complex societies in this region. The period following the emergence of these
walled sites saw the florescence of a strong polity, known most widely from the fabulous finds at
Sanxingdui and Jinsha. This paper examines these issues and compares the situation near
Chengdu to other late Neolithic walled sites in China.

[144] Thinking Angkor
Angkor, the great medieval Khmer capital, has been a focus of western scholarship for over a
century. But due to Cambodia‘s late 20th century tragedy Angkor was not brought into the
incessant disputes of the past thirty to forty years of archaeological theorising. In consequence,
Angkor offers a powerful opportunity to think of other paths for archaeology than the prevailing,
exhausted conceptual truce between the processual and contextual approaches. An alternative
can now be envisaged that decouples the material and the social action and implements a
hierarchy of explanatory scales to encompass the myriad possible perspectives of archaeology.

[73] Conclusions and Prospects for Future Research
Debates about Classic Maya political structure continue, although the existence of variability in
the scale and degree of centralization of Maya polities is now recognized. However, there have
been few studies that have explored in detail how the political organization of a Classic Maya
state is manifested in the relationship between the primary center and its dependent secondary or
tertiary centers. Multidisciplinary studies in the Motul de San Jose zone have now provided
exciting hints into the complexity of these political, economic and social ties between Motul de
San Jose and its dependent centers, such as La Trinidad, Buenavista-Nuevo San Jose, Cantetul,
Chakokot, Chachaclum. This paper will provide preliminary conclusions and propose prospects
for the next stage of investigation of the political structure of the Central Peten Lakes area.

Trade in the Southeastern United States
The deerskin trade was a major factor in the economy of the Indians of the southeastern United
States during the eighteenth century. Hides from deer were collected by southeastern Indians
and traded in great quantities to European markets through ports in South Carolina. Indian deer
hunting techniques included methods which burned large portions of the forest. A recent
palynological study at Fort Benning, Georgia and Alabama reveals evidence of anthropogenic
forest fire which may be the result of increased deer hunting and the eighteenth century deerskin

Initially recorded at Taos Pueblo in 1906, the 'story of the Beautiful Maiden' details the
adolescence, maturation, and deification of the apical female figure in the Northern Tiwa

ceremonial roles of women in Taos prehistory, arguing that female participation in the ritual
sphere declined markedly following the initial period of village life. Out of this reexamination, new
conclusions are drawn regarding the nature of gendered ritual spaces as well as the ritual

[42] Crucible Smelting of Copper Ore at 5th Millennium Tal-i Iblis (Iran)
Fifth millennium ceramic crucible sherds excavated by J.R. Caldwell at Tal-i Iblis provide strong
evidence of use in an extractive metallurgical technology for winning metallic copper from copper
oxide ores. Crucible interiors, heavily vitrified with copper prills trapped within a slaggy matrix,
were heated to temperatures reaching 1200°C; sherd exteriors reached only ca. 1000-1100°C.
These crucibles were charged with ore and covered with fuel to concentrate heat within the
crucible chamber. Archaeological and metallurgical investigations of crucible smelting indicate
that crucibles were widely used in prehistory where copper oxide ores were processed. Tal-i Iblis
provides one of the earliest examples anywhere in the world.

[134] Defining the Copan Maya Invisible Settlement Bias and its Implications
Maya settlement data have been collected via surface survey for over 100 years, yielding critical
information on the visible architecture left behind by the ancient Maya. Subsurface deposits,
however, have proven more difficult to identify, creating a growing concern among scholars that
the "invisible" or "hidden" structures buried below ground- surface may create a systematic
settlement bias. This paper details the identification of these "invisible" structures during the PAC
II Copan rural settlement survey, and explores their sampling ramifications. Several "invisible"
categories are identified based on excavations, including fieldhuts, kitchen platforms, lithic,
ceramic, and plaster workshops, and earlier phase structures destroyed for later phase building
materials. The theoretical implications of these "invisible" Maya remains are considered, and
methodological recommendations for their recovery are offered.

I suggest that the over next decade, zooarchaeology will see closer examination of the ecological

populations to have had substantial, long-term impacts on the structure of ecological communities
throughout the world. While our interest in human ecology is long-standing, our grasp of the ways
in which small-scale societies shaped regional ecological structures is in its infancy. Drawing on
examples from South African pastoralist sites, I argue that we emphasize ecological theory and
change across time, rather than behavioral interpretation of isolated data.

[67] Where's Waldo: Shamanism in the Domestic Archaeological Record
Is Waldo a singular entity whose totality can be differentiated from the massive throngs of
society? Or, perhaps Waldo is the fulfillment of many characteristics in one being? As scientists,
we tend to reduce the search to a singularity, one entity embodying all the characteristics of
"Waldoness." The average two-year-old, not indoctrinated by reductionistic thinking, looks at this
same picture and sees Waldo's glasses, hat, and cane everywhere, integrated throughout the
picture. Is Shamanism to be similarly reducible to a singularity, a person, usually male, emboding
the Arendtian characteristics of "action" divorced from "work." Or can shamanism be viewed as
an integral aspect of everyday life expressed in the way in which work is actualized? Examination
of an archaeological site's location within a broader ecological community provides a more
holistic examination of "actions" coupled with "labor." Environmental reconstruction and ethno-
historical data are used to define foraging behavior, not as simply the gathering of food, but as
the realization of shamanist belief.

Contrastingly, Fourmile Polychrome exhibited lighter and more variable paste colors following

Sandals have a potential great variety of specific construction and design attributes and can be
directly dated to establish chronologies of development. They are, therefore, significant for
examining spatial patterns in material culture across the Colorado Plateau and between this
region and the Great Basin. Analysis and dating of sandals from a large area centered on the
Colorado River demonstrates that footwear of the earliest foragers shared close links to the Great

[86] Putting it in Feminist Perspective
To contextualize the session, I review recent theoretical trends in feminist archaeology. The past
decade of scholarly work has produced a body of diverse perspectives situated under the
umbrella of feminist archaeology. Multiple theories have significantly expanded practitioners‘
interpretations. However, not all feminist perspectives currently in circulation can be effectively or
productively applied to archaeologists‘ available datasets. Given different quantities of materials,
quality of preservation, textual resources, and analogical references, perhaps feminist
archaeologists should critically evaluate the application of specific theories to recovered data.
Herein I address how archaeologists can engage feminist theories to consider specific cultural
cases and datasets.

[94] Igneous Diatremes as Sources of Flakable Lithologies and Pottery Temper in Southwestern
Colorado
Flakes of aphanitic minette were identified from Ancestral Puebloan habitation sites in Mesa
Verde Park and nearby Ute Reservation. Although this micaceous, olivene-rich lithology is more
common to the south, three igneous centers, called diatremes, are adjacent to MVNP. The
northernmost contains dense, black, flakable aphanitic minette. This material erodes into the
Mancos River and is found, flaked, on gravel terraces downstream. Crumbling diatremes are an
easy source for pottery temper. Grayware sherds with micaeous temper were found next to two
sources in UMTP and MVNP. These sherds are probably local wares rather than trade items from
the Chuskan region.

[138] Recent International Cases and Prognosis for the Future: Avenues for Cooperation in
Domestic and International Archaeological Protection
We tend to think of different fields of archaeology as distinct from each other, and we similarly
tend to bifurcate the legal regimes that address the problems of domestic and international
archaeological site looting. The recent use of different legal mechanisms from the domestic and
international contexts has resulted in more creative legal solutions. The Sentencing Guideline for
Cultural Heritage Resource Crimes and the SAA's Standards for Archaeological Damage should
be adapted to the international archaeological heritage and we should move toward greater
integration and understanding of the domestic and international legal regimes.

[89] Artificial Culture: A Posthuman Approach to Processual Archaeology
Empirically, culture is the complex interaction of cognitions, individuals, groups, artifacts and
architectures, differentially distributed through space and time. Artificial culture is the quest for
describing, understanding and explaining the evolution of culture process using computer
simulations. It seeks to explore large constellations of counterfactual "what-if" scenarios using
computational objects that represent multiple material, energetic and cognitive agency, each
operating across a mix of media and scales. An ideal simulation is a system (theory) built of
interlocking relationships (hypotheses) that is free to evolve creative solutions (heterarchical
emergences) from novel adaptive challenges, a specifically posthuman scientific approach to
processual archaeology.

BC Susiana Plain, Iran
Ceramic sourcing via neutron activation analysis (INAA) has met with considerable difficulty in the
Near East. In the Susiana Plain (Iran), prior INAA research concluded that source clays were too
homogenous to have discriminating power. Emboldened by statistical reanalysis of this data and
advances in INAA, we prose that inter-site variability can be discerned in this region and have
subjected a dataset of 200 ceramics, dating to the fourth millennium BC, to INAA at the MURR
reactor. Contrary to prior research, our results demonstrate clear compositional groups,
suggesting localized production and regional exchange of ceramics.

Small-scale archaeological landscape studies can complement even limited excavation data
without further alteration of a site. I present data from recent research undertaken at the village of
Cardonal, a multi-component formative site in the Andes of Northwest Argentina, combining the
results of initial excavations with easily recorded geospatial data. Small-scale GIS analysis of the
orientation and elevation of habitation structures within the village reveals that similarly shaped
structures throughout the site may have served distinct purposes. In contrast to assumptions that
status relations during the formative period were relatively equal, the Cardonal data suggest a
notable differentiation of living habits.

[100] Strontium Isotope and Trace Element Analysis of Human Skeletal Material from Hungary
Accelerated mass spectrometry was utilized to study isotopes and trace elements in human
skeletal material from a Middle Copper Age Hungarian site. 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios in the
human teeth were compared to values in the bone and teeth from local faunal species to study
population movement. All samples were tested for trace element concentrations to evaluate
preservation, correlations between trace elements and isotopes, and to identify dietary
differences. Preliminary analyses suggest the population did not utilize soils in the Carpathian
Mountains. Trace element concentrations indicate differential preservation between teeth and
bone as well as distinct diet ranges between species.

[161] Animal Use in the Early Colonial Southwest: Dimensions and Prospects
Over the last thirty years, zooarchaeological studies of indigenous animal use in the pre-contact
Southwest have become increasingly sophisticated. They have expanded from species lists to
exploring changing ecological relations over time, inter-ethnic symbioses, social dimensions of
predation and provisioning, and roles of animal species in social rituals and ideological change.
Much less is known of the time span immediately after the Spanish occupation of the region.
However, studies carried out in the last decade open prospects for exploring details of indigenous
and colonist animal use during this period. Taken together these studies can inform future
research design.

these elements directly impacts the number of identified elements in a collection. Vestigial

[31] Place and Person at Teotihuacan, Mexico
Pronounced differences between Classic period Teotihuacan and contemporary Maya cities are
frequently explained using an analytical dichotomy that contrasts groups and individuals.
According to this approach, Maya art and architecture manifest a cult of the ruler, whereas
Teotihuacan's depersonalized art, lack of royal tombs, and gridded plan indicate a corporate
group ethos. However, archaeological evidence for these interpretations is not compelling;
moreover, the dichotomy is misleading. The key to their differences may lie in conceptions of
embodied versus emplaced personae. The identity of Teotihuacanos was shaped by the city
itself, and their concepts of personhood entwined with their built environment.

In this paper we examine the ways that archaeologists have historically interpreted southwestern
pithouse community organization, providing a context for understanding the significance of
current research. For early archaeologists, pithouse sites represented the first settled farming
villages. Much research in the 1980s questioned these interpretations, seeing instead pithouse
dwellers as mobile people who practiced a mixed subsistence strategy. Recent research on Late
Archaic agricultural dependence and variation in the economic and social organization at
pithouse sites have prompted the need for re-examination of the origins and development of
southwestern communities during a critical period of change, A.D. 200-900.

The Late Classic Maya (A.D. 600-850) of Colha, Belize utilized a lithic type called general utility
bifaces for activities ranging from deforestation to stone molding as evidenced by use-wear
patterns. Exploring different recycling practices, I have discovered a previously unnoticed
technique for the proximal reduction of these implements whereby the truncated poll could be
employed as a bit in contact. Using statistical analysis, I will elucidate this recycling pattern by
emphasizing the reduction techniques this strategy shares with other lithic technologies found at
Colha. This paper will place paramount importance on the dynamism represented by general
utility biface recycling behavior.

[19] The Significance of Mussel Collecting to California Channel Islands Prehistoric Populations
The dietary importance California mussels to prehistoric populations varied in time and space on
the California Channel Islands. Some of this variation is determined by geographic variables that
affect the distribution and productivity of mussels, but the availability of other marine food
resources also was important. Moreover, the degree to which populations on each of the Channel
Islands depended on California mussels affects the character of the archaeological record,
particularly with regard to site visibility. Thus, the nature of subsistence-settlement systems, and
the degree to which they may be discerned, varied depending on the degree of dependence on
mussels.

[48] Northern San Juan Intra-regional Interaction During the "Turbulent 1200s"
In the late 13th century, the large-scale regional depopulation of the Northern San Juan resulted
in the displacement of 1,000s of people. Delineating the social and economic connections in
place during this time of widespread emigration enables assessment of how cooperative
interactions may have related to the process of depopulation. This research documents intra-
regional interaction by sourcing the production and distribution of Mesa Verde pottery among 23
sites to identify cooperative networks utilized during this stressful, and ultimately transformative
time. Results suggest a high percentage of local production and distribution, differences in the
circulation of jars and bowls, and significant variation in intra-regional ties.

[7] Theory on the Archaeology of the Early Peopling of the Americas
The archaeology of the early peopling of the Americas was dominated by empirical concerns.
While this research approach produced a wealth of information, it did not address theoretical
discussions. Even regarding methodology there were few developments; the basic
methodological preoccupation was the establishment and implementation of reliable standards for
claim assessments, especially about the temporality of sites and assemblages. An empirical
approach, however, does not preclude a theoretical apparatus, even when it is not explicit. In fact,
an unstated theoretical agenda exists in the archaeology of the early peopling of the Americas,
which will be examined in this paper.

accordingly conceived as an incremental continuum, with relatively minor disruptions occurring
under sophisticated and complex circumstances. Nevertheless, at least in the Levant, the initial
Early Neolithic floruit appears to have quite rapidly ground to a halt. While basic economic life-
ways continue, i.e., plant cultivation and herding, the amazing scale and complexity of the Early
Neolithic disappeared, only to re-emerge in the archaeological record thousands of years later.

[144] Changing Patterns of Land Use around Kamphaeng Phet, Central Thailand
The relationship between agricultural intensification and the development of complexity remains a
critical issue. While agricultural surplus is often seen as the mainstay of surplus production, Hirth
(1996) suggests that agriculture is only one of several ways, including specialized good
production, to create surplus for state development. Recent environmental fieldwork around
Kamphaeng Phet investigated the timing of land use change in relation to the development of the
city from the early 2nd millennium AD. Agricultural expansion seems to predate the historical
city‘s formation, and specialized production centers appear to be a consequence of the
development of urban networks.

[2] Climate, Grasses, Bison, and Humans on the U.S. Southern Great Plains during the Early
Paleoindian Occupation (11,900 - 10,200 B.P.)
This study uses Laser Ablation Inductively coupled Plasma/Mass Spectrometry (LA-ICP/MS) to
examine the down-tooth distribution of trace elements in enamel of Bison bison and Bison
antiquus from the U.S. Southern Great Plains. In addition, I evaluate the impact that changing
climate, vegetation, and fauna had on human adaptive strategies on the Southern Plains between
11,900 B.P. and 10,200 B.P. Paleoenvironmental proxy data indicate a shift from a cool and
moist climate with a diverse flora to warmer and drier conditions with a more homogenous steppe
environment on the Southern Plains. Acquired elemental concentrations from Bison bison tooth
samples provide an elemental map from which the movements of migratory prehistoric herds may
be assessed. Bison antiquus tooth samples may indicate an adaptation to a more seasonal
environment by having longer and more structured movements after the Younger Dryas. Human
adaptive strategies on the Southern Plains shifted from a moderately specialized approach to
highly specialized around 11,000 B.P. There is a clear relationship between environmental
change and human adaptation on the Southern Plains between 11,900 B.P. and 10,200 B.P.

[22] Bison Procurement and Trade Fairs among the Jumanos Pueblos, Central New Mexico
In this paper, I examine Plains exchange relationships and the procurement of bison among the
Jumanos Pueblos, a group of four pueblo villages in central New Mexico occupied from A.D.
1300 to the 1670s, by examining the inter-site distribution of bison remains from excavated
samples. One pueblo in particular, Gran Quivira, seems to have enjoyed much greater access to

[140] Ethnoarchaeology through Behavioral Ecology: Integrating Material Studies with
Anthropological Approaches to What Tools Do
Ethnoarchaeological investigations of technology have overwhelmingly focused on the
manufacture of gear items. This provides very direct links with material analyses about the
archaeological record but emphasize the mechanics of construction to understand technical
systems and patterning in the archaeological record. Ethnoarchaeology also offers significant
opportunities to develop methods for studying traditional economic activities even with
technologies that are not specifically analogous to pre-steel tools. Quantified ethnoarchaeological
research employing behavioral observation methods expands opportunities to investigate a range
of technologies, subsistence practices, land use, labor organization, and social structure beyond
approaches dependent on direct analogies with specific prehistoric materials.

[47] Aspects of Communal and Ceremonial Food Preparation in New Kingdom Egypt
For the past several years I have been studying various aspects of banqueting and feasting in
ancient Egypt. It is clear that ancient Egyptians used occasions of communal consumption of food
to create or support social hierarchies. Like their Bronze Age Near Eastern counterparts, New
Kingdom pharaohs used distribution of cooked food as well as rations to cement political and
economic relationships. My past studies have concentrated on the serving of these foods, but this
paper would look at the methods of food preparation for these ceremonial or ritual occasions.

[67] Dance Rings and Shaman on the Northern Plains
Stone circles are common on the northern Plains, but extra large enclosures occur infrequently.
Circles and ovals over nine meters across are larger than residential rings and lack the interior
partitions and external attachments of medicine wheels. It has been hypothesized that some may
be communal lodges or dance rings for a specific ceremonial precinct. Settings usually overlook
lower areas and are always in open country away from sites like caves and large rockshelters,
where ritual activity was known to occur. These are locations, of extreme exposure to heat, cold,
rain, snow, and wind -- conditions which, along with intensive rhythmic drumming and exhaustion
from prolonged dancing, cause trance. It is suggested that these large stone circles are dance
rings associated with communal ritual or social activity, for which trance would be a reasonable
component.

[46] Survival of Organic Residues in Pottery from Southwest Asia during the Early Holocene
For this study, 150 ceramic fragments from twelve early villages in southwest Asia were
examined utilizing gas-chromatography and mass-spectrometry. Five fragments exhibited
abundances, elution orders and molecular weights characteristic of bitumen, whereas only two
sherds exhibited biomolecular signatures of animal fats or vegetable oils. Due to poor
preservation of n-hexadecanoic acid (C16:0) and n-octadecanoic acid (C18:0) specific functions
were unable to be securely attributed to this assemblage of ceramic fragments. Future
biomolecular reconstructions from this formative period must identify the soil properties and
climatic conditions that facilitate the preservation of fatty acids and pinpoint locations with the
greatest likelihood for survival of organic residues.

[105] The Case for Fremont Lithic Craft Specialization at Hunchback Shelter, a Seasonal Camp

Located near one of the major obsidian sources in the eastern Great Basin, Hunchback Shelter
(42BE751) is a small rockshelter in the Mineral Mountains. Excavation of the shelter has yielded
a large flaked lithic assemblage, much of it associated with Fremont occupations dating between
A.D. 650 and 1250. Throughout the Formative period, bifacial preforms, arrow points, and flakes
of obsidian were produced in large quantities at the site. Certain aspects of the flaked lithic data
as well as other lines of evidence suggest that some of the Fremont materials may represent the
work of part-time craft specialists.

United States are often planned, historical, formal landscapes, such as gardens, farmsteads, or

This model outlines the archaeological correlates for a number of site variables that provide

regional mobility patterns and identify factors causing spatio-temporal variation.

This paper investigates what it means if local populations reject connections with the
archaeological past that archaeologists and others postulate. Archaeology was introduced into
the South Asian subcontinent enmeshed in power relations, which have had profound
repercussions (still reverberating) for the ways in which the discipline was embraced by South
Asian scholars. The ways in which archaeologists deal with these repercussions has implications
for the practice of archaeology, One is that although Indian archaeology has developed a strong
tradition, a legacy of its colonial history is the proposition that archaeology is the only legitimate
way of knowing the past.

At two South African public rock art sites, there are innovative new visitor centres concerned with
rock art conservation, job creation, tourism promotion, and challenging attitudes towards
indigenous people and their art. The dual function of rock art as a source for research and
educational purposes and as a resource for tourism income and employment will empower not
just academics but also - and more importantly - local communities. I discuss methods of
presentation and visitor experiences at the sites, and consider in what way, if any, the two new
ventures are challenging perceptions of indigenousness in South Africa.

[39] New Pathways through Pequot Country
The Pathways Project, funded by a grant from the National Science Foundation, is a 3-year
collaboration involving museums, schools, and Native communities from New England and the
Southwest. Unlike other archaeology and education initiatives, this project seeks to engage
students in active learning about the interconnectedness of the natural and social worlds in Native
communities. To date, partners have developed curriculum maps and explorations, summer field
camps and after school programs, and a web site. While one objective is to create networks of
citizen scientists, it is apparent that the project is becoming a pathway to new approaches for an
archaeology in ancestral homelands.

[145] Movement of Staple Goods: A Study from the Hohokam Community of Marana, Arizona
The Hohokam of the Sonoran Desert were prehistoric agriculturalists who lived in multi-site
communities. Villages occupied a gradient of ecological zones from the floodplain to the mountain
pediments. Agricultural potential varied in each of five zones. The Marana Mound site (A. D.
1150-1250) was the central seat of authority within the larger Marana community but was located
on poor agricultural land. In this paper I use paleoethnobotanical evidence to evaluate the
hypothesis that intra-community exchange of staple foods was a 'critical element in the economic
soundness' of the multi-site Marana community centered on the mound.

[141] Long-term Ranchería Resilience in Southwestern Chihuahua, Mexico: Seeking
Explanations for Persistent Dispersed Communities
Southwestern Chihuahua, Mexico lies between Casas Grandes and the northern edge of
Mesoamerica. The contrast between the dispersed farming ranchería settlements here and the
Mesoamerican Chalchihuites occupations to the south defines the northern Mesoamerican
boundary, yet its formation is poorly understood. The boundary cannot be readily attributed to
poor farming conditions as dry farming is presently possible, and the region contains a number of
highly arable river valleys. We propose a model of labor organization and cultural ecology that
may elucidate this long-term dispersed ranchería pattern, which also contrasts with prehistoric
episodes of aggregation in the U.S. Southwest.

[158] The Effect of Ceramic Specialization on Household Gender Roles: Evidence from the West
Branch Site
During the Rincon phase of the Hohokam sequence, women living at the West Branch settlement
specialized, on a part-time basis, in pottery production. Although such specializations were
probably not uncommon in the Southwest, this represents one of the few cases in which the
specializing settlement and households have been identified. Compared to other specialized craft
activities, pottery manufacture is less easily incorporated into household routines. We explore
how women dealt with the challenges of fitting surplus ceramic production into their daily lives

of those ties largely inversely proportional to the distance between the spheres of influence.
Recent investigations involving various material classes point to a more complex interaction of
the introduction, spread and integration of cultural elements in this region.

[139] 'On the Front Door Steps of the Vast Anasazi Domain:' Pithouse Settlements of the
Transition Zone
Throughout much of prehistory, the transition zone of central Arizona was beyond and between
defined archaeological cultures. The rugged landscape of the Mogollon Rim region supports
forests and parklands with abundant resources. Studies of past land use show this to be a region
of persistent mobility, sometimes used for year round residence, and at other times for seasonal
resource exploitation. The advance and retreat of populations created occupational disjunctures.
This lack of continuity and limited in-situ cultural development poses significant challenges to our
ability to discern the identity of past residents and their relations to surrounding regions.

[151] Regional Cranial Morphological Variation at the Transition from Paleoindian to Archaic
Cranial morphological data on Paleoamerican and Archaic samples throughout the United States
varies greatly by region. These data are reviewed and examined for regional variation between
the Paleoindian and Archaic periods. The limited number of crania that can be classified as
Paleoamerican are compared to the regionally diverse Archaic samples to gauge the level of
similarity and continuity at the Paleoindian-Archaic transition throughout North America. Issues
discussed include interpretive limitations related to sample size, disproportionate distribution of
Archaic period samples, and regional variation in temporal boundary identification.

[141] A Middle Archaic Occupation in the Tollgate and Tollhouse Canyons, Southeastern Arizona
Investigations at sixteen archaeological sites along US 191 in Greenlee County, southeastern
Arizona, yielded significant Middle Archaic finds. The sites lie within a unique cultural landscape
that connects the San Simon and Safford Valleys to the Gila River uplands through the Peloncillo
Mountains. The sites consist of artifact scatters with few diagnostics. One site, however,
contained evidence for Paleoindian through Middle Formative occupations. A large Middle
Archaic component, including buried Pinto/San Jose series projectile points associated with a
grain of maize pollen, was discovered. Radiocarbon dates on bulk soil and mesquite charcoal,
and obsidian hydration indicate a time depth of approximately 5000 years.

[162] Testing Assumptions about the Archaeological Record of Yosemite Valley
Through the 1990s, several decades of archaeological investigations in the Yosemite Valley of

assumptions are archaeologically testable. Led by a newly published research design for
Yosemite National Park (Hull and Moratto 1999), archaeological investigations in 2003 and 2004
used a strong geoarchaeological focus to test the validity of those assumptions while providing
the Section 106 compliance needed by the Park. The result has brought progress for both the
Park‘s regulatory obligations and research goals applicable to several fields of study, and furthers
the multidisciplinary approach to archaeological research.

[97] Demography, Social Power, and the Dynamics of Identity among Ancient Immigrants
In our research on migration during the period A.D. 1200-1450, we consider the interplay of
structure and agency. Abundant evidence of migration during this interval provides opportunities
to explore the dynamics of structure, agency, identity, and power in the context of co-residence.
We have found that the scale of migration and the locations of immigrant enclaves are most
reliably inferred using a structure-based approach. Following this assessment, an agency-based
approach informs on power relations and expressions of identity among immigrants and local
groups. We illustrate this two-step methodology using examples from the San Pedro Valley and
the Tonto Basin, Arizona.

[40] Late Archaic Copper Procurement and Production in the Southern Lake Superior Basin: An
Example from the Duck Lake Site
Recent research has begun to identify sites associated with Archaic period procurement and
production of copper artifacts in the southern Lake Superior Basin. Dating to approximately 3400
BP, the Duck Lake site represents one such site. Lithic analysis demonstrates a strong reliance
on distant lithic sources, suggesting that site occupants were involved in a larger regional system
encompassing portions of the southwestern Lake Superior basin and upper Mississippi Valley.
One interpretation of the lithic data is that copper was procured by logistical task groups that
traveled to the site from the south as part of a direct procurement strategy.

[27] Central Plains Tradition Pottery Style Distribution and its Correlation with Chemical
Composition as Determined by Using Neutron Activation Analysis
Our observations suggest that the stylistic variability of western Central Plains tradition (CPT)
pottery from Kansas, Nebraska, Colorado and Wyoming is greater across drainages than it is
along drainages. This has implications for evaluating the interaction among CPT communities.
We used neutron activation analysis to determine compositional similarities and differences
among pottery sherds from western CPT sites, identifying eight compositional groups. While one
compositional group includes several sites from northwest Kansas and southwest Nebraska,
distinct compositional groups for several other sites indicate limited movement of pottery between
these sites and tentatively corroborate our ideas about the direction of population connections.

Evidence from Bonneville Estates Rockshelter
Thousands of Late Pleistocene-aged faunal specimens have been found associated with multiple

Nevada. Late Pleistocene foragers there hunted a diversity of terrestrial vertebrates and
waterfowl such as pronghorn, rabbits, and ducks. Regional patterns of site densities suggest that
post-Younger Dryas human populations were increasing in the Great Basin compared to earlier
(e.g., Clovis) occupations. The nutritional ecology model suggests that increases in human
populations should be associated with increasingly diverse diets, and that is precisely the pattern
we see for the Late Pleistocene occupations at BER.

geographical, linguistic, oral tradition, historical, archaeological, and other relevant evidence.
Finally, the process culminates with cooperatively implementing ultimate dispositions of affiliated
remains and objects. At the Smithsonian and elsewhere, anthropology applied in these real-world
legal and social contexts becomes the repatriation process.

[56] The Paleoethnobotanical Record From McEuen Cave, East-Central Arizona
Excavations at McEuen Cave in 1997 and 2001 demonstrated that, despite decades of
vandalism, intact deposits and botanical items of considerable importance remained. Multiple
direct AMS dates on maize, squash, and little barley clustered around 3600 rcybp, placing them
at the Middle Archaic/Early Agricultural Period boundary. Topics to be discussed include the
nature and composition of the botanical assemblage; the cultigen record, with emphasis on a
morphometric profile of the maize and its spatial/temporal relationships with contemporaneous
populations; and the contribution of McEuen Cave to questions of the timing of the arrival of
agriculture and its adoption in the American Southwest.

[138] Archaeological Resource Damage: The Hidden Price Paid
Federal land managers deal with various impacts on archaeological resources ranging from
hikers to military training with heavy tanks. Compounding these known activities are unknown
activities such as vandalism and looting. When applying the Archaeological Resources Protection
Act (ARPA) to assess damage, the land managers take into account a suite of variables to
assess the coat of damage. This paper discusses those variables that are not often considered
until we actually implement restoration/mitigation of the damage or reach the courtroom and are
faced with the question "why are these rocks Important to our history?"

[82] Relating Past Floodplain Changes to Archaeology along the Santa Cruz River, Tucson,
Arizona
The Santa Cruz River in southern Arizona is the best stratigraphically documented river in the
American Southwest. Several episodes of valley entrenchment and channel shifts have been
radiocarbon dated and related to past changes in human settlement patterns in the Tucson Basin.
However, recent studies suggest that different reaches of the river respond individually to external
and internal forces resulting in variable floodplain changes. I will summarize previous
geoarchaeological research on the Santa Cruz River and present new stratigraphic data that
adds to our picture of a dynamic fluvial system linked to indigenous agriculture and settlement in
the desert Southwest.

[22] Corn and Chiefs: Agricultural Potential and Emergent Complexity in a Great House
Community
The Blue J great house community in the Red Mesa Valley, New Mexico is an ideal location to
study the connection between resource inequities and emergent complexity due to extensive
archaeological research and because it consists of six distinct "neighborhoods." Incorporating
GIS, soil studies, and excavation data, I consider differential access of the neighborhoods to the
best farmland. Highly productive farmland, coupled with a relatively stable environment, may
have led to relatively few economic and social inequities within the community. This, in turn,
inhibited the construction of a characteristic great house. This research has implications for
understanding the Chaco phenomenon.

[156] Ecological Perspectives on Animal Symbolism: A South American Case Study
There is often something of a theoretical war between archaeologists who see the
zooarchaeological record as a reflection of ecology and those who see it as a reflection of
ideology or social agency. The former tend to disdain studies that lack explicit tests of hypotheses
with measurable data, while the latter tend to disdain studies that reduce human behavior to
biology or predictive formulae. This study attempts to bridge these extremes and link ecological
and ideological behaviors. It argues that ecology helps to explain the symbolic importance of
certain types of fauna, and that this can be tested cross-culturally. Coastal Peru is used as a case
study.

Development, community change, theft, and poor management practices impact historic

management have affected Wesleyan Cemetery, and in 1992, people reported bone and
discarded dirt piles on the grounds. At Carpenter's Run Pioneer Cemetery in Blue Ash, a wealthy

[114] The Archaeology of "Indirect" Culture Contact
The processes of "contact" between native and non-native people in North America often began
prior to face-to-face encounters or direct involvement of native people in colonial institutions. This
is particularly relevant with respect to the introduction of non-native diseases through down-the-
line transmission. As a result, the cultural consequences of "contact" played out in traditional
social and natural settings but likely involved circumstances uncommon to short-term native
history. This presents methodological challenges to archaeologists, necessitating a long-term
view culture change and appreciation for process of contact as one of the last events contributing
to patterns we see in the archaeological record.

[105] Holocene Valley Infill and the Search for Paleoindian Sites: Results of Geomorphological
Investigations of Eastern Great Basin Hydromorphic Features
Approximately 70 sites containing Paleoindian diagnostic artifacts have been identified in the
eastern Great Basin. Most of these sites are located either in valleys or in the upland areas of
mountain ranges. In an effort to explain why Paleoindian sites have not been identified within
valley bottoms, geomorphological analyses and radiocarbon samples were taken from
archaeological excavations within the Great Basin. The resulting variation in ages, in conjunction
with the depths at which the samples were exhumed, suggests that significant Holocene
sediment infill has taken place within the valleys. Thus, surviving Paleoindian aged sites may be
deeply buried.

Floods and droughts and their effects on Hohokam irrigation agriculture play a prominent role in
many cultural-historical interpretations of the Hohokam trajectory in the Salt River basin of central

depopulation of the lower Salt River basin ca. A.D. 1450 or later (Graybill et al. 1989). An
examination of population growth and decline (inferred from domestic architecture in a well-

and frequency of inferred floods and droughts increased.

identified specimens (n=1189) from this site, 29% are fish, 25% reptiles, 6% birds, and 40%
mammals. The collection has a richness of at least 26 different species; however, the only
species that comprise more than 1% of the assemblage are gar (Lepisosteidae), turtle
(Testudinata), ground squirrel (Spermophilus sp.), and deer (Odocoileus sp.). Although these
fauna were probably dominant in the prehistoric diet here, the preponderance of their skeletal
material also reflects cultural taphonomic processes as the remains were heavily burned and
fragmented when the dwellings were abandoned.

[94] Modeling Long-term Human Ecology: Simulating Prehistoric Settlement in the Upland
Southwest
Long-term socio-natural interaction has generated much interest in anthropology in general and in
archaeology in particular. Combining modern and paleoenvironmental data, we retrodict annual
landscape production of several natural resources considered critical to sustained occupation of
the upland Southwest. Given various resource requirements and variable climatic and edaphic
conditions, this research predicts where households should locate to most effectively utilize their
landscape. By comparing the archaeological record of centuries of regional occupations to
simulated household settlement patterns within the ‗Village‘ project study area of the Mesa Verde
region, we model the influences of different resources on long-term settlement decisions.

[160] Luminescence Dating of Architectural Features at Chavin de Huantar, Peru
The chronology of the construction sequence at the monumental temple of Chavin de Huantar in
highland Peru has long been debated. This is at least partially due to the difficulty in obtaining
relevant samples for chronometric dating at the site. To address this problem, we are attempting
to directly date the construction events by applying luminescence dating to both mortar and stone
materials. We discuss collection procedures, problems in determining radioactivity, and evidence
for proper zeroing of the samples at the time of construction. We then present some preliminary
results, and briefly discuss the potential for future applications of luminescence dating of
monumental architecture.

[19] The Frenchman and the Fetishes: Léon de Cessac’s Channel Islands Collections, 1877-78
The French archaeologist Léon de Cessac undertook extensive fieldwork on Santa Cruz, San
Miguel, Anacapa, and San Nicolas Islands in 1877-78. Unfortunately, he never completed a
formal monograph, and most of his original manuscripts have been missing for more than a
century. His extant collections include a number of rare and unique pieces, including an
unparalleled assemblage of stone fetishes from San Nicolas Island. A new look at Cessac‘s
collections, along with some recent archival discoveries, provide a basis for elucidating cultural
differences and similarities between the Northern and Southern Channel Islands and
reconstructing aspects of prehistoric exchange systems.

This paper first considers some key topics in the cognitive science of social groups, which provide
descriptions of reasoning strategies that humans in general use when forming impressions and
making inferences about different social groups. They may also help inform methods for
identifying and interpreting social groups in the archaeological past. As an illustration, the

[143] The Occupational History of the Area Known as Mound W at Moundville
Because of its large recovered sample of grog-tempered pottery, the area known as Mound W at
Moundville, Alabama, has always been speculated to have the potential to aid in the debate
about the Late Woodland – Mississippian transition in the Black Warrior Valley; however, analysis
of the materials from this area has not occurred since its excavation in 1941. In this paper I
discuss Mound W‘s occupational history and its spatial and chronological position on the
Moundville terrace. In particular, I examine a detailed set of vertical mound profiles as well as
burial, feature, and field specimen records in order to reconstruct spatial relationships/surfaces. In
addition, I describe Mound W‘s mixed ceramic assemblage and the particular usefulness of
multiple linear regression in tackling this area‘s complex dating problem.

[134] Estimating the Size of the Invisible Maya Population: Challenges and Opportunities
How large was the lowland Maya invisible population and what percentage of the total population
did it represent? To address this question I (a) identify minimally mounded structures as those
most likely to be invisible in the archaeological record and (b) examine minimally mounded
structure trends at three sites where surface, visibility conditions are unusually good. From the
latter I draw broad inferences about lowland Maya minimally mounded settlement and thus
invisible population trends. Although at the sites examined minimally mounded structures
constitute more than 35% of all mapped structures, such structures probably over-represent the
invisible population because most were briefly occupied.

[159] Smith’s Legacy in the Northern Lowlands: The Pottery of Mayapan
While the Uaxactun sequence has been the primary influence on the ceramic interpretation of

from Smith‘s other major contribution to Maya ceramics- the Mayapan report. From it comes our
greatest reliance- the type descriptions, and our greatest sources of confusion- both temporal and
geographic. An examination of the theoretical and methodological biases inherent in the report
should clear up some of these confusions and permit an easier communication between
archaeologists and comparison of the ceramic content of archaeological sites.

Despite its increasing abundance and functional importance through time, very little is known of
the timing and manner of its spread throughout the area. Over the past thirty years, several

[111] Netted Structures in the Prehistoric Great Basin
Within the prehistoric Great Basin, netted fabrics are well represented in perishable artifact
assemblages and typically occur in the form of hunting or fishing nets. Other netted structures
recorded include bags, hair nets, and sling pockets. The importance of netted fabrics to Great
Basin peoples is demonstrated by their relative abundance and their reuse as constituent parts in
the manufacture of other items. This paper reviews the chronology and primary technology of
knotted and so-called "knotless" nets. I also discuss the use context of archaeological specimens
in relation to what is known ethnographically about netted structures in the region.

In 2003 a preliminary archaeological survey was conducted in the Yucay Valley, Peru, to identify
sites pertaining to communities of mitmaqkuna and naturales described in 16th century
documents. Contrary to expectations, these sites were not dominated by artifacts of clear Inka or
Spanish colonial manufacture, but rather ceramic styles typically ascribed to the Late
Intermediate Period. This paper discusses the relationship between the documentary record and
the archaeological assemblages of the sites recorded during the survey and considers the
implications for our understanding of patterns of local production and consumption under Inka

[130] Zooarchaeology, Evolutionary Ecology, and the Sexual Division of Labor
Over the last decade, zooarchaeologists have increasingly turned to evolutionary ecology, and in
particular, optimal foraging theory, as analytical framework. Many of these studies have identified
instances of resource depression based on a decrease through time in the ratio of large (higher-
ranked) to small (lower-ranked) game. This approach makes the assumption that all resources
can be attributed to a single hunting strategy. In this paper, we consider how gender-based
differences in foraging strategies might affect such studies, and make suggestions as to how
zooarchaeologists might deal with the problems posed by the sexual division of labor.

[5] Digital Landscapes: Using Viewshed Analysis to Explore New York Iroquois Village Movement
Over the last 50 years settlement pattern studies in Iroquoian archaeology have yielded large
amounts of information about prehistoric life in the Northeast including patterns of small-scale
migration. Iroquois settlement patterns were characterized by periods of sedentism interrupted by
village movements every 20 to 30 years to a new location within a few kilometers of the original
settlement (Snow, 1994: 71). Viewshed analysis in GIS yields information about the role visibility
of the surrounding landscape plays in the selection of village locations. Correlations between
visibility and village location allow us to explore specific community movements in new and
interesting ways.

[120] The Unthinkable in Western North American Prehistory: Archaeological Evidence for
Southern California-Polynesia Contact
Material similarities suggestive of prehistoric Polynesian contact with southern California, first
recognized over a century ago, have become unthinkable within the confines of processual and
postmodernist archaeologies. Discovery of a linguistic nexus for terms related to construction of
sewn plank canoes, provides ample incentive to reconsider this seemingly implausible possibility.
Sewn plank watercraft were produced in only one location in Native North America yet this
construction technique was common throughout Polynesia. The initial appearance in southern
California of sewn plank canoes coincides with punctuated adaptive change (e.g., increased
exploitation of pelagic fish) and appearance of a Polynesian style two-piece bone fishhook.
Despite longstanding agreement that economic change through time in the Chumash area
reflects in situ adaptation, the material record in combination with new linguistic findings suggests
at least a modicum of external influence.

[71] Paleoecology of the Sanak Archipelago
The Sanak Island archipelago preserves high resolution records of late Quaternary terrestrial,
lacustrine, and marine / littoral environmental change. While environmental conditions during the
Holocene approximate those of the Alaska Peninsula, 40 km to the north, the islands have been
influenced by processes significantly distinct from the peninsula because of their geology and
relative isolation on the continental shelf edge. The archipelago was probably overrun twice by
advances of the distal margins of a late Wisconsin ice sheet centered between the peninsula and
Shumagin Islands. Till is thin however, and soil parent materials are derived from multiple tephras
and weathered bedrock. A pronounced transition from widespread alluviation to downcutting that
occurred in the late Holocene is provisionally linked to regional climate change, although raised
shorelines and infilling of bays suggests that isostatic and/or seismic uplift have influenced island
hydrology. Data generated from geological, pedological, limnological, and volcanological research
on Sanak are remarkable because they integrate broader shifts in the north Pacific ecosystem
and provide the context for human adaptation to and manipulation of this system.

In this paper I present the results of recent ethno-archaeological work amongst hunter, fisher
gatherers in Western Siberia. I will argue that ethnographic studies of artefact use and deposition,
amongst present day communities in Siberia, have much to offer archaeologists interested in past
world views. In particular, an ethnoarchaeological focus on the processes by which cultural
landscapes are produced and inhabited equips us with a sophisticated range of interpretative
frameworks which open out our understandings of the richness and diversity of hunter gatherer
worldviews and their links to ecology, subsistence, mobility and social organisation.

least affinity with Africans. For the Y chromosome, STR, and Alu polymorphisms, upper castes
were most similar to Europeans, while lower castes were most similar to Asians. These findings
are consistent with a scenario in which a relatively recent influx of Indo-European speakers
appropriated the higher ranks of the caste system.

[54] Conflict in Formative Period Oaxaca
In this paper, I examine the nature, scale, and motivating factors for conflict in Formative Period
Oaxaca. Most researchers have focused on warfare as directed towards territorial conquest for
the control of land and trade. I review evidence for warfare in other regions of Formative
Mesoamerica along with ethnohistoric data on conflict to consider other factors that may have
motivated interpolity conflict. I conclude that in order to more fully understand patterns of early
warfare in Oaxaca, we must also consider the role of religious belief and the internal dynamics of
polities, in addition to interpolity competition for material resources.

Occupied by 1600 BC, Puerto Escondido is the earliest village site known in Honduras.
Excavations in four separate areas of the site have produced data allowing in-site comparison of
residential and non-residential architectural elaboration, and of the production and consumption
of pottery, obsidian, and shell artifacts. Differences in consumption between residents of different
sectors of the site are recognizable by 1300 BC and are strongly marked between 1100 and 700

obsidian was a common raw material in the Neolithic and Paleometal complexes of the region.

[43] The Archaeological Evidence for Changing Strategies of Tropical Forest Adaptation in
Prehistoric to Historic Period Philippine Foragers
There has been significant debate on the capacity of humid interior tropical forests in Southeast
Asia to sustain human foragers without some integration of farming or trading for agricultural
products into their subsistence regimes, questioning the possibility of early Holocene colonization
of such ecological zones. Ethnographic, historic, and archaeological evidence suggests that
ecological arguments on foraging limitations based on carbohydrate shortages may not consider
cultural practices such as storage and plant manipulation, as well as shifting strategies of
specialization and trade among foragers of the region. In examining these issues, archaeological
evidence is presented for changing strategies of tropical forest utilization in prehistoric to historic
period hunter-gatherers of the Philippines.

Imagery
The Rayed Arc motif accompanying a human figure is commonly found in Columbia Plateau rock
art. Like many other iconic motifs in rock art this image can be interpreted as having a
neuropsychological origin. Due to its compositional nature this motif can be interpreted as a
transitional entoptic image. This records the moment when the trance participant stops merely
observing the imagery and seems to enter the other world via a "tunnel" and fully participates
within it. Similar images found in other areas and cultures help support the argument that the
image is based on universal mental patterns.

[97] Social Transformations in the Context of Aggregation
This paper examines the creation and maintenance of social boundaries at Hummingbird Pueblo
in Central New Mexico. Evaluation of ceramic data indicate that 14th century social boundaries
were affected both by aggregation of the local population, as well as immigration from the
Western Pueblo region, into this village. The coalition of various groups would have required
transformations in group identity. Such transformations occurred through daily attempts by village
residents to reproduce their social order in the changed context of aggregation and immigration.
As a result, some aspects of pottery suggest an emphasis on signaling separate group identities,
while other aspects suggest an emphasis on village-wide integration.

Results
For the late Middle Palaeolithic and Upper Palaeolithic of Siberia we collected 432 radiocarbon
dates from 130 sites which were combined into 276 occupation episodes. Occupation density can
be subdivided into three intervals: 46,000-36,000, 36,000-16,000, and 16,000-12,000 BP. Up to
ca. 36,000 BP, the density of populations was very low. A higher density can be detected at ca.
36,000-16,000 BP. There was no significant decrease in density during the LGM (20,000-18,000
BP) showing that environmental conditions posed no substantial deterrent to human occupation.
After ca. 16,000 BP, population density grew exponentially, and was the highest in the

[79] Who Thought Rock Art Was About Archaeology!? The Political Economy of Saharan Rock
Art
In spite of the Central Sahara containing some of the world‘s best known and most magnificent
prehistoric rock art, a leading expert in this field recently pronounced that its contribution to
science had been minimal. While that statement is debatable, this paper provides it with some
credibility by showing how the discovery, exploration, interpretation and exploitation of the
Tassilian rock art of the Central Sahara, from the 1950s to the present, has been driven as much
by extraneous political and ideological motivations and associated fraudulent activities, as
concern for the method and science of archaeology.

[136] Hilltop Settlements of the Central Andes: New Models and Perspectives
The paper attempts to broaden current explanations for Late Intermediate Period hilltop
settlement in the Peruvian highlands. This settlement pattern is held as a defensive response to
rising political tensions after the Wari collapse, but preliminary research on hilltop settlements
from the Chanka heartland of the Andahuaylas Valley does not convincingly support this conflict
model. A regional drought in the south central Peruvian highlands may have coincided with
sociopolitical flux, suggesting a more complex picture for shifting settlement patterns. A
settlement ecology framework is presented to understand more completely not just political, but
also ecological factors for hilltop settlement.

[25] Dietary Carbohydrates Influence Collagen Stable Isotope Values and the Collagen to Apatite
Offset in Diets with Normal Protein Levels
In contrast to common assumption, a combination of all experimental feeding data reveals a
variable relation between bone collagen d13C values and dietary protein. Bone collagen values
show input of dietary carbohydrate on all diets; but the collagen to apatite offset is smaller with C3
(0-5 per mil) than with C4 carbohydrates (5-11per mil) irrespective of the type of dietary protein.
Faunal field studies and many archaeological human populations largely match these patterns. In
contrast, some Maya, Ontario agriculturists, and California island foragers relied on C4 proteins
and foods to an extent greater than previously recognized. Funded by UC Regents to MS.

Our excavations of the Hurrian city of Urkesh, in northeastern Syria, have uncovered a city dating

of ceramic production and the carving of cylinder seals. In both cases we have examples of
learning by imitation. In the ceramic production, it is clear that when the imitations were produced
there were no living practitioners of that type of ceramics, given the long chronological distance
between the original and the imitation. The cases for cylinder seal design imitation are two, both
imitations of the original design of inferior quality.

Recent research at Chavin has demonstrated that the site‘s architectural sequence is

Prior to 2004, radiocarbon dates associated with architecture existed only for the site‘s final

of the Chavin Architectural Dating Project, begun in 2004, is to determine absolute dates for the
full architectural sequence by using radiocarbon and luminescence methods to directly date
construction materials including mortar and stone. This paper presents initial new dates
documenting Chavin‘s architectural growth, and addresses Chavin‘s place in Andean chronology.

Small villages begin to appear in the archaeological record of La Junta de los Rios (where the
Conchos River of Mexico confluences with the Rio Grande in Texas) around AD 1200. In these
first villages, material culture resembles that of the pueblos found in the Jornada Mogollon during
the same period. J. Charles Kelly posited that the villages at La Junta developed from a small
colony that migrated to this valley from the El Paso area. Recent instrumental neutron activation
analysis of sherds from these villages shed new light on the veracity (or not) of this hypothesis.

Although as yet little known, the Biographic rock art of the Green River Basin is a rich corpus of
data that spans from about A.D. 1550 to 1870. Our first two years of fieldwork provide sufficient
data to begin constructing a chronology of Green River Basin Biographic rock art. Partial or full
recording of seven sites shows an evolutionary sequence of five narrative art styles that mimics
the already-defined Northern Plains Biographic sequence. The centerpieces of this Green River

Middle Archaic (ca. 6000-4000 Cal BP) mound building is extensively documented in the
Mississippi Valley. Well known mound sites, such as Watson Brake, Frenchmen‘s Bend, and
Hedgpeth are all located on Pleistocene terraces overlooking the alluvial valley of the Mississippi
or its tributaries. Unlike other contemporary sites, Nolan (5200-4800 Cal BP.) is located in the
alluvial valley of the Mississippi River in northeast Louisiana. Preliminary archaeological and
geoarchaeological study of well-preserved depositional contexts provides the basis for assessing
existing ideas about the role climate played in the development of Middle Holocene mound

emerges is a unique history characterized by population fluctuations, ethnic diversity, and
sometime dramatic social change, all played out against the backdrop of a fairly consistent use of

This paper focuses on the contribution of feminist approaches to understanding how social

from the Ulúa Valley, Honduras and Oaxaca, Mexico, we examine how everyday practices from
the production of household goods to the reproduction of domestic groups constituted social
reproduction at multiple scales. We consider how practice-based approaches to the constitution
of personhood illuminate aspects of materiality that provide evidence for the performance and
negotiation of multiple social identities on the household level.

Sharing of food is a ubiquitous characteristic of egalitarian societies based on a foraging
economy. Nonetheless, intra-group resource transfers is diverse in form and extent due to
differences that arise in response to a mix of ecological and social factors. In this paper I present
a methodological approach, based on faunal analysis, to recognized food sharing behavior in the
archaeological context. I am also concerned with the germaneness of applying those techniques
to investigate theoretical problems regarding the evolution of food sharing among hunter-
gatherers societies. Ethnoarchaeological and ethnographic data relating to Ache society from
eastern Paraguay is used in testing food-sharing models derived from evolutionary ecology.

[120] Linguistic Evidence for Prehistoric Polynesian Contact in Southern California
Five of the six attested Chumashan languages had a word for the distinctive sewn-plank canoe.
The lexical distribution enables linguists to reconstruct an early Chumashan form */tomolo'o/,
used in common by the ancestors of Central and Island Chumashan speakers. This
reconstructed form is odd by Chumashan phonotactic and morphological standards, and unlike
normal Chumashan, cannot be further analyzed into constituent parts. The only other North
American group to construct sewn-plank canoes, the Gabrielino, also have lexical items ti'at
'plank canoe' and tarayna 'boat' which are grammatically anomalous and otherwise unattested in
Uto-Aztecan. In this paper I demonstrate that these forms are not native to Chumashan and
Gabrielino, and propose further that they were borrowed from a Central Eastern Polynesian
language.

material as part of a mobile lifeway. Bamforth (2002) recently evaluated the efficacy of the high-
tech forager hypothesis and found that important parts of our current understanding need
reconsideration. Building on Bamforth's research, we test the high-tech forager hypothesis using
an expanded database consisting of more published site reports and seven assemblage-level
chipped stone analyses from Folsom, Alberta and Cody sites across the northern Great Plains.
We evaluate the hypothesis by exploring organizational properties of raw material source
selection, core reduction and biface production. While our data generally support Bamforth's
recognition that problems exist with the high-tech forager hypothesis, we view adherence to the
tenets of the hypothesis as largely an organizational response to contextual factors.

lacking in substantial terrestrial resources, inhabitants of the Alaska Peninsula have been able to
exploit considerable quantities of salmon for thousands of years. Prehistoric settlement pattern
data from the Nelson Lagoon river drainage suggest that an emphasis on salmon exploitation in
this area led to a departure from traditionally held views of Aleut subsistence and settlement.
Several large sites dating to the last 3000 years contain over 250 surface depressions and large
permanent houses constructed of whalebone that are located up to twenty kilometers by river
from the Bering Sea. These data are discussed with respect to social complexity, settlement, and
salmon fishing and an alternative expression of prehistoric Aleut identity is outlined.

[97] An Agency-Centered Analysis of the Depopulation of Sand Canyon Pueblo, Southwestern
Colorado
This paper explores the agency of community members at Sand Canyon Pueblo during the final
years of occupation of the central Mesa Verde region by ancestral Pueblo Indians. Agency is
examined here by the piecing together of evidence of individual lives, events, and sequences of
events within a structural framework. The result is a chronicle of acute subsistence stress,
changes in subsistence strategy, competition for resources, and escalating conflict-conditions and
events that contributed to the demise of this large village and to Pueblo migrations from the
region shortly after the onset of the Great Drought in A.D.1276.

[121] Persistence and Extinction of Adaptive Lifeways: Development and Collapse of the Near
East Neolithic
The development of Near East Neolithic Lifeways is often viewed as an inevitable development of
cultural evolution, characterized by greater technological, social, and economic complexity. This
case study explores the persistence and collapse of the Neolithic as a series of adaptive
responses to local conditions. I discuss how cultural traditions can be passed on inter-
generationally using concepts of agency and routine practice and outline how community scale
ritual and economic changes were interrelated in the abandonment of this Neolithic package.

[33] The First and (Hopefully) Last Roundup: Retrieving Forgotten Collections
Compliance with Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act does not end with SHPO
concurrence on a report. With all archaeological studies, and especially data recovery mitigation,
the information and knowledge gained resides in field notes, photographs, and artifacts. In the
past, proper care of these important materials has been left to chance. However, recently the
Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has acted to solve its collection problem. This paper
discusses how the Department has addressed nearly 20 year's worth of non-curated collections,

[69] A Proposed Late Prehistoric and Early Historic Phase Sequence for the Jemez Plateau,
North-central New Mexico, USA
The Jemez Plateau of north-central New Mexico has traditionally been considered one of the
least known regions of the northern Southwest. It is also among the areas most densely settled
by Pueblo peoples in late prehistoric and early historic times. The lack of a sequence for
settlement and population has meant that the Jemez Plateau has not been fully incorporated into
overviews of Southwestern cultural change. A proposed phase sequence for A.D. 1250-1700
demonstrates that the Jemez Plateau was integral to the processes of migration, aggregation and
inter-community network formation that swept the northern Southwest during this era.

Recent research suggests that the late prehistoric Zuni region of New Mexico was characterized
by considerable organizational diversity rather than a single, homogeneous tradition as has long

village, documents intensive occupation of the area immediately prior to and contemporaneous
with the pueblo. We use GIS analysis to examine settlement patterns and landscape use around
the Fort Site. We combine these data with ceramic typological and compositional data to
document processes of aggregation and community formation and explore issues of community

Through increased interaction at the household and community level southern semi-sedentary

success were promoted by accumulative knowledge, accommodation of difference, and division

[7] Environmental Corridors and Early Human Dispersal in South America
Human dispersal is not necessarily a unidirectional process where continental ecological patches
must be completely colonized before groups will move to a new patch. Human dispersal can also
take place through environmental corridors between patches and/or ecological regions. By
spreading through these corridors humans can i) increase the dispersal rates between
patches/ecoregions, ii) quickly colonize empty regions, and iii) guarantee metapopulation
persistence. We integrate paleoenvironmental and early South American site distribution data in a
Geographic Information System (GIS) and discuss in which cases environmental corridors played
a significant role in human dispersal.

analysis. Such processual analysis highlights the impact of contextual constraints on a tool-

were maintained during the colonial period in part through the ritual feeding of sacred "beasts" at
abandoned village, forest and field sites. Archaeological evidence for long term patterns will be
examined, and possible impacts of the revival of old land use practices will be discussed.

genetic fingerprints of each rock type, permitting the development of a rheological classification
system that can direct the researcher towards understanding the tectonic setting of the lithic
material. Understanding of raw material lithogenesis permits the researcher to more accurately
predict the geologic occurrence and field relations of the lithic material, and hence predict areas
where lithic procurement of a specific rock type may have occurred.

[106] An Unusual Erosional Feature on Mastodon Tusks from the Hiscock Site (Western New

Of 23 mastodon tusks from the Hiscock Site (western New York), five bear a flattened surface
along one complete side. The presence of this "beveling" on the outer wall of the pulp cavity, and
the absence of tertiary dentine on the inner wall, suggest the phenomenon is postmortem. The
affected tusks are interspersed with normal ones, and no micro-wear is evident on the flat
surfaces. Paleoindians are known to have occupied the site, and to have used bones as tools.
Thus, while seeking a natural erosional agency to explain this feature, a cultural origin must be
considered as well.

suggest that Barger Gulch represents a single Folsom occupation with limited post-depositional

rooms. We present this range of construction and its functions, emphasizing spatial arrangements
and construction techniques, and compare it to previously-known buildings.

[23] Improving the Framework for Assigning Provenance to Sand-Tempered Ceramics: Examples
from the Tucson Basin, Arizona
Petrofacies modeling is successful in defining sand composition zones from which potters
obtained sand to temper pottery. However, natural sand distributions rarely follow neatly
delineated borders-petrofacies boundaries are often diffused. Provenance assignment of samples
from border locations can be difficult, unlike the easily characterized "central composition"
samples in a petrofacies. To address this problem, we present several petrographic and
computational techniques, including detailed petrographic grain characterization, averaging of
petrographic data to create postulated compositions within a grid of known compositions, and
jackknifed discriminant analysis models. These techniques are applied to "problematic" ceramics
from sites in the Tucson Basin.

Distance challenges big pictures: doubts arise from our perceptions of the importance of distance.

the context of the North American regional dynamics. The distance between Mesa Verde and
Chaco is not even long, in any useful sense. In this poster, ancient Puebloan geography is
compared to that of Hohokam, Casas Grandes, Mississippian, and Post-classic Mesoamerica.
These comparisons have implications for North American archaeology and, perhaps, for

[52] Recent Excavations at the Comb Wash Great House Site, San Juan County, Utah
The University of Colorado recently completed three seasons (2002-2004) of archaeological
explorations at the Comb Wash Great House site near Blanding, Utah. Test excavations focused
on middens, kiva-like depressions, and room block areas within the main structure. Both ceramic
and architectural analysis suggest that the great house dates to the Pueblo III Period (AD 1150-
1300)--after the collapse of the Chacoan regional system--and appears to be a local
development. Other great house communities in the greater northern San Juan region that are
contemporary with Comb Wash will be discussed for comparative purposes.

[47] An Islamic Flavor: Cooking and Social Change in Highland Yemen
Traditional households in Yemen are designed to maximize privacy, a fact usually attributed to
Islamic religious principles that advocate the segregation of women from the eyes of men.
However, similar domestic arrangements emerged long before the advent of Islam. The initial
shift occurred in highland Yemen between the second and first millenniums BC when food
processing and cooking changed from communal activities to focus on individual families living
and working primarily indoors. The long-term history of pre-Islamic cooking practices in Yemen
sheds light on social concerns which contributed to the development of a major world religion.

Recent archaeological research in the Sayula basin provides evidence from the Early Formative

Therefore, they make a great source of data that complements chemical residue analysis. In this

Place is an immediately accessible, almost intuitively obvious analytical construct: an historical,

to understand social space as produced and place-making as a situated and historical process.
Places simultaneously embody and evoke history while acting as a repertoire for subsequent
spatial practice and providing the raw material for the constitution of social geographies. Drawing
on archaeological and historical contexts from Pre-Colonial South India, we consider how places
are made, remembered, reconstituted, appropriated, and historicized as a creative and fluid
process of instituting claims about the past, heritage, and the nature of the present.

Hopeton Earthworks is one of the best preserved geometric enclosure sites remaining in the
Scioto River Valley of southern Ohio. Although the walls are only about one-third their original
height, four years of archaeological, geo-archaeological and geophysical research is generating
valuable information about the methods and materials used to construct the massive earthen
walls. Seven trenches across walls forming a large rectangle and a great circle document that
specific soils were being quarried for wall construction. The sustained multi-disciplinary program
of study is beginning to generate an estimate of the human effort that went into constructing this
ancient monument.

[94] Archaeological Landscapes in the Las Vegas Valley
A survey of over 46,000 acres within the Las Vegas Valley provided an opportunity to integrate
and synthesize site records from throughout the valley. Although most regional syntheses
reference landscapes implicitly, an explicit landscape approach accommodates multiple research
themes and lines of evidence and provides parameters for effective scales of observation, the
grain and extent of culturally meaningful places. This poster examines distributions of over 1100
prehistoric sites from local landscape and broader valley-wide perspectives. We highlight distinct
occupational profiles or place use-histories by examining distributions of activity-assemblage
types and cultural-temporal affiliations.

[23] Using Petrography to Demonstrate the Link between Roosevelt Red Ware and Ancient
Immigrants
Archaeologists initially attributed the origin of the Salado phenomenon to the movement of groups
from northern Arizona to central and southern Arizona and adjacent areas. Migration-based
models of Classic period (A.D. 1200-1450) dynamics in the southern Southwest eventually fell out
of favor. Compositional and stylistic analyses conducted during the 1990s, however, revived the
idea that Roosevelt Red Ware (Salado polychrome pottery) was developed by immigrants. The
results of recent petrographic work in the San Pedro Valley of southeastern Arizona strongly
suggest that northern immigrants were responsible not only for the origin of Roosevelt Red ware
but also its wide distribution.

[82] A 3,000-Year-Old Irrigated Cornfield in Southern Arizona
Recent excavations in a floodplain near Tucson, Arizona, revealed hundreds of unusual holes
next to buried prehistoric canals. Multiple lines of evidence, including fossil pollen, macrobotanical
remains, ostracode shells, and geomorphological evidence, indicate that these were planting
holes in an irrigated maize field. Radiocarbon dating of charred maize places the age of this field
near 1100 B.C., an antiquity that increases the significance of this unique discovery. This paper
describes the archaeological traces of this irrigated field system, its environmental context, and its
implications for understanding early agriculture in southwestern North America.

[85] Caste in West African Archaeology: Crucial or Irrelevant?
The definition of West African caste systems has been debated for decades, but ethnographers
agree on the crucial role that these specialists play in societies where they are found. Curiously,
the implications of these debates for archaeological interpretations have not been widely
recognised, particuarly in the realm of day-to-day production of material culture. This may relate
to the gendered characteristics of that production. Caste-conscious archaeological interpretations
must also take into account the chronology of caste development. This paper will examine the
role of caste in interpretations of West African material culture variability, with special reference to
the Lake Chad Basin.

[17] Reassessing the Evidence for Low-Level Food Production on the Park Plateau, circa A.D.
400-1000
Although domesticates, such as Zea mays and Phaseolus vulgaris, have been recovered from
Developmental period (A.D. 400-1000) sites on the Park Plateau of northeastern New Mexico,
archaeologists in the region are reluctant to attribute much significance to the role of food
production in Developmental period subsistence economies. The reasons are varied, ranging
from posited environmental constraints on cultivation to low frequencies of domesticates at
archaeological sites. Another issue is the conceptual ambivalence of distinguishing between
"agricultural" and "nonagricultural" societies in the archaeological record. I address these issues
and present new archaeobotanical data from recently excavated sites on the Park Plateau.

[151] The Paleoarchaic to Archaic Transition in the Great Basin
In the Great Basin, a region of alternating mountains and valleys, the early Holocene transition
from Paleoarchaic to Archaic foraging strategies was characterized primarily by the expansion of
the number and kinds of habitats foraging groups exploited, the addition of seed processing to the
resource base, and a change in mobility by those groups newly focused on the exploitation of
upland ecosystems. The transition was also characterized by continuity in the way wetland
communities were exploited, albeit in a reduced number of locations, and was thus essentially an
additive process.

Results of recent survey and excavation of Early Preceramic (ca. 11,200-9,000 BP) Fishtail and
Paiján sites in the lower Jequetepeque Valley are discussed in terms of their significance for
understanding early hunter-gatherer cultural diversity in South America and the process of
increasing localization during the critical Late Pleistocene-Early Holocene transition. These data
provide new insight into the initial settlement and subsequent economic and technological
regionalization that occurred on the Peruvian North Coast following the end of glacial conditions.
These data also provide an important comparative case for modeling the diversity of Late

[46] Fatty Acid Analysis of Archaeological Residues: Procedures and Possibilities
Archaeological food residues extracted from areas of fat accumulation in artifacts can be
characterized on the basis of relative fatty acid composition. Compositions of ancient residues are
compared to experimental residues subjected to periods of oven storage, which simulates the
effects of oxidative decomposition over time. Levels of medium and very long chain saturated
fatty acids, octadecanoic acid (C18:0) and octadecenoic acid (C18:1) isomers indicate the fat
content of the material of origin and probable presence of animal or plant material. This technique
performs well in blind tests of decomposed residues of previously unknown foods and
identification criteria remain valid over time.

[157] Archaeometallurgy of Copper in Michoacan, Mexico
The smelting of ores is almost invariably related to the formation of slags, because slags act as
collectors for impurities. Slag analysis thus has the potential for revealing important information
about metallurgical technology. Copper smelting slag recovered from the excavations at the
archaeological site of Itziparátzico, Michoacan, Mexico, has been analyzed for microstructure and
compositional properties. Preliminary results indicate a smelting technology that used sulfidic
ores and highly efficient furnaces. While further archaeological investigations are required to
precisely date these activities, this technological information is important for establishing the
context and scale of production of metal goods in ancient Mesoamerica.

[152] Ethnicity and the Ancient Maya: Conflict in Copan and Tikal
Modern theories suggest that ethnicity is a constant reworking of cultural identity in response to
present and future considerations. In contemporary society, ethnicity is a salient issue in - and
often the justification for - conflicts throughout the world. Though the concepts of ethnicity are
grounded in modern observations, current interpretations of archaeological and iconographic
material of Copan and Tikal indicate that during periods of instability, elites manipulated ethnic
awareness to maintain/rebuild society. Both the ruler, however, and the general population,
played active roles in resolving their diverse and frequently conflicting interests. Symbols and
myths appear to have been used, created and reworked in this process.

[68] Ethnic Identities in the Inka Empire: The View from Language
An outstanding finding by linguistic anthropologists in the past decade is that human communities
are normally multilingual and that the boundaries of languages and their internal texture and
deployment within speech communities are historically variable and socially instituted. The
consequences for Andean prehistory are substantial, and involve rethinking the relationship
among language, "ethnicity," state, and territory. I discuss specifically Andean ways of fitting
language onto differentiated social space in the Inka State and in the colonial Andes and reflect
on the grounding of traditional archaeological models in unspoken assumptions of the
naturalness of 19th-century ideas about language and nationality within Andean nationality
projects.

[136] Local Processes Beginning the Middle Horizon on the Peruvian Central Coast
My paper discusses the beginning of the middle horizon on the central cost of Peru, particularly in

the state during the middle horizon in the north and south of Peru. These hypotheses suggest
that the growth of the state during the middle horizon is not due to foreign influence as
traditionally supposed, but rather that the development is a result of local processes. The
interaction between different areas occurred later. The current evidence on the central coast
shows a similar pattern for this area, coinciding with the new hypotheses, dating and data. These
local processes were an important part of the central coast identity that the Spaniards
encountered when they arrived.

[69] Deconstructing Pueblo del Arroyo, Reconstructing Chaco
Despite more than a century of scholarship, we still do not fully understand the enigmatic society
that built the monumental masonry buildings in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, AD 850-1150. One
of the big questions about the great houses is, "How many people lived there?" Many scholars
have addressed this question using a variety of methods beginning with early studies by Fisher
(1934) and Pierson (1949) who both estimated a population of 1200 for the great house Pueblo
Bonito. More recently, Bernardini (1999) analyzed residential suites of Pueblo Bonito and arrived
at a much lower estimate of 72 individuals in 12 households. This study applies Bernardini‘s
method to an adjacent great house, Pueblo del Arroyo. It appears that residential quarters of
Pueblo del Arroyo were only a small portion of the overall construction and that the maximum
population never exceeded 60 individuals or 10 households. Given recent higher labor estimates,
it is unlikely that the inhabitants of Pueblo del Arroyo were numerous enough to provide the labor
necessary to construct the great house.

[2] Bison in the Bluegrass: Context and Implications of a Late Holocene Bison (Bison bison) Find
from Kentucky
During an archaeological survey in spring of 2003, bison (Bison bison) remains were found buried
along a small upland stream in Scott County, Kentucky. In situ faunal specimens representing a
single bison, were recovered from approximately 1.3 meters below the ground surface.
Geological and paleoecological data suggest that the bison was buried within late Holocene
alluvium, and a conventional radiocarbon age of 240-30 BP (Beta-186169) was acquired from the
bone. Additionally, bone collagen was extracted, suggesting a diet for this individual. This find is
consistent with historic accounts of bison in the area, but it represents one of the few documented
bison finds in the Ohio Valley. This poster explores the significance of this find and provides a
context for other bison sites in the region.

[132] The Archaeology of Mexico Under State Control
In Mexico, archaeology had its origin in a strategic proposal of the Mexican State, where the first

national character of archaeological monuments. The creation of the Instituto Nacional de
Antropologia e Historia in 1939 reaffirmed the public interest of archaeological duty. However,
even in the context that the practice of archaeology can be interpreted as a vertical action, in
reality the execution of archaeological projects are often restricted due to aged problematic in the
life of the country, which should be understood before generating a problem. Among those
approached are: land tenure, land use, traditions and customs, and political problems. Emphasis
is given to the need to establish ties through agreements, and informal relations with the different
levels of government, as well as in a daily way with communities, authorities, and social groups
that exercise some level of interest concerning archaeological heritage.

[121] The Multiplication of Forms: Bering Strait Harpoon Heads as a Demic and Microevolutionary
Proxy
Sedentism, higher populations, elaborate art and cemeteries appeared about Bering Strait 500-
200 BC, based on a whaling-derived surplus. Scalar stress produced conflict over resource hot
spots, AD 400-900. Demic boundaries are definable from motifs on sealing and whaling harpoon
heads. Demographic profiles from burials (n=1200) reflect warfare (skewed sex ratios) with dated
graves peaking at AD 1000. Most cemeteries were dominated over centuries by a single set of
motifs, with intrusions that indicate shifts in ethnicity, ecological or climatic change. Shifts in
harpoon heads correlate with ice hunting strategies and population expansion-providing the
matrix of microevolution.

Ecuador poses challenges to research which moves beyond questions of cultural history. Many

This paper examines the Guangala Phase and the relation of this cultural style to the subsequent
Manteno style. The model proposed derives from ceramic stylistic and technological studies, raw
material sourcing and other archaeological data. The question addressed is the relationship
between the Guangala style present until 500-600/800 AD and the Manteno groups who met the
Spanish in the 16th century.

But the degree to which these resources are applicable to pre-Conquest cultures has been
questioned. In terms of gender analysis, it can be difficult to move beyond simple studies of task
differentiation in these pre-literate societies, except in the few cases where the iconographic
record is particularly descriptive. This paper examines the extent to which colonialist colorations
of gender roles affect archaeological interpretation of gender concepts 1000 years before the
conquest.

[8] Theorizing Place in Archaeology: An Introduction
While the relationship between social phenomena and their spatial dimensions has long been a
primary focus of archaeological research, archaeologists have only recently begun to explicitly
discuss the concept of place. Despite these discussions and the increasing utilization of the term
"place" in archaeology, adequate definitions and theorizations are lacking. This paper presents an
overview of the concept of place and discusses the main theoretical and methodological issues
involved. Emphasis is given to practice theory and phenomenological approaches, particularly in
regards to the study of identity, memory and experience. Discussion of methodology focuses on
the use of computer technology.

[69] Results from the Cox Ranch Pueblo Community Research Project
This poster summarizes the findings of the Cox Ranch Community Research Project, an ongoing
project designed to explore a Chaco-era community (A.D. 1050-1130) in west-central New
Mexico. Research in 2004 focused on attributes of great house construction, the use of public
and private spaces, as well as an understanding of settlement pattern in the local community. By
comparing the location and presumed function of great house and kiva features at Cox Ranch to
similar features elsewhere, we are able to evaluate the nature of Chacoan influence on the
development of this southern great house community.

19th-century definitions of secularism. This challenges both archaeological interpretation and
practice. We illustrate our point with discussions of anthropological interpretations of the meaning
of shell bead wampum and the creation of American heritage sites in Northeastern North
America. In both instances the sacred serves to mediate the presence of the past, and does so in
ways that illustrate how the empowered and less powerful relate to the dominant culture.

[87] Ritual Foci across the Urban Landscape of Tiwanaku
Access to and from major ritual spaces is considered a primary indicator of social and polity
hierarchy. Excavations of georadar anomalies detected in the monumental core uncovered a
pattern of repeating ritual structures that may have formed a secondary or complementary level of
ritual foci to the major visible monuments. This research proposes that these U-shaped structures
served as the ritual focus for specific areas of the site while the major monuments served as the
local for state-sponsored activities. The implication is that a primary cohesive force for resident
population may have been association these group-based ritual activities.

technological specialization at the end of the Middle Ceramic Period was evaluated using a

marine shells existed at Gran Coclé. This inference derives from the number of beads, the
different stages for their elaboration, and the selection of raw material.)

Vivian as Mentor
As public archaeology and cultural resources management began to emerge as an applied field
of research and historic preservation, those of us who worked for the Arizona State Museum in
the 1970s were privileged to work with Gwinn Vivian as colleague and mentor. Gwinn set the bar
high, suggested we think creatively and respond quickly, watch our budgets and our backs, find
solutions, and above all remember our responsibility to the greater public whose heritage and
culture, as well as their dollars, should be preserved if at all possible. These formative principles
have fully shaped my career. Any successes that I have experienced, I attribute to the learning
journey begun 30 years ago with Gwinn Vivian, and to his lessons still current and always in
mind.

understanding social change. These methods depend on cooking vessels as material correlates
of cultural behaviors—either as signs of enculturative traditions, or as evidence of supra-
household consumption. This dynamic has caused a methodological conflict whereby cooking
pots are seen as unconscious products of habitus and engaged in activities involving conscious
expressions of status and identity. My paper examines the role of a foreign cooking vessel at the
Iron Age site of Tel Miqne-Ekron, where it may be implicated in activities signifying both
foreigners and feasting rituals.

Archaeological Value: Solving the Archaeological Value Determination Problem
In actual Archaeological Resources Protection Act (ARPA) cases and in a five-day Archaeological

Fiber-based technologies comprise a significant fraction of the material culture produced by the
indigenous inhabitants of the Great Basin and the Southwest. During the development of

scrutinized by a handful of researchers for what they revealed about local culture histories and for
what they could contribute to the definition of archaeological cultures. Our paper reviews this
early work on perishable artifacts and explores the insight and knowledge this research lent to the
development of western North American archaeology and to the maturation of archaeological

[77] Aggregation and the Relief of Social Tensions at Peet Alberts Kopjes, Northwestern Namibia
This paper examines the Peet Alberts Kopjes rock art site in Northwestern Namibia. This paper
analyzes the spatial distribution of various motifs across the site. Using multivariate statistics, the
paper finds a strong association between giraffe, zebra, leopard, and 'honeycomb' geometric
representations. In this paper, I make the case that the rock art resulted from social behavior
designed to relieve tensions caused by crowding and scarcity during dry season aggregation.
Specifically, the rock art is consistent with Lewis-Williams (1988) definition of neuropsychological
imagery and I argue is evidence for trance dancing.

[94] Detecting Subpopulations at Grasshopper Pueblo Through the Use of Dental Morphology
Work by previous researchers has pointed to the presence of population subsets at the 14th
century A.D. site of Grasshopper Pueblo in Arizona. In this study, analysis of dental morphology
was used to investigate intrasite biodistance. A full suite of standard morphological observations
as well as some experimental measurements were recorded for each specimen in the skeletal
collection. A hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the spatial distribution of adult dental
groups formed a similar pattern to that indicated by previous studies. This result tends to confirm
the efficacy of dental morphology as a tool for intrasite biodistance studies.

[124] Hunting Prehistoric Crops in Western Pennsylvania
The earliest domesticated crop from Western Pennsylvania was Pepo squash. It was present by

rainfall proves to be an extremely significant component also of the spread of crop agriculture
from the Mediterranean Levant. This paper explores the likely growth habits of early cereals,
using archaeological and botanical evidence and suggests that rainfall parameters acted as a
barrier to early crop agriculture's spread. The geographical spread of agriculture is as much a
story of technological advances as the adaptation of domesticates to new environments.

[129] Socio-political Implications of an Isolated Blade Workshop: Commodities, Control, and
Specialization
Craft specialization has long been considered a factor in the rise of socio-political complexity in
Mesoamerica. Though this process is understood, new evidence continues to confound old
explanations and warrants more refined models. Settlement pattern studies focused on the lower
Cacaulapa valley, Northwestern Honduras, have identified a blade production workshop near the
monumental center of El Coyote. Excavations at this workshop collected 81 exhausted prismatic
cores and core fragments along with blade production debris. The presence of craft-specialists
outside the primate center raises key questions about the role of economic integration and socio-
political centralization.

[19] Socioeconomic Implications of Fishhook Technology on the California Islands
Analyses of prehistoric fishing implements from the California Islands have traditionally focused
on various technical attributes and the creation of typologies. These studies have identified
variations among fishhook assemblages with morphological differences being interpreted as
cultural markers between Northern and Southern Island populations. However, that the increasing
dietary importance of fish was an inter-island phenomenon suggests that subtle geographic
variations among fishhooks had little effect on fishery exploitation. I argue that the development of
extractive technologies followed similar historical trajectories on different islands and that the
increased productivity of new technologies had significant socioeconomic ramifications on a
regional scale.

[5] Early and Middle Woodland Copper Procurement and Exchange
This project evaluates copper exchange in Early and Middle Woodland times. Various models
have been proposed for the acquisition of copper (through direct procurement or trade), and the
manufacture and distribution of finished objects. These models can be tested by 1) quantifying
the number and location of copper-bearing sites, copper objects, and various artifact types, 2)
determining sources of copper through trace-element work, and 3) using this information to
explore models of production and exchange. This poster reports on the first of these three goals
by focusing on the distribution of some 29,000 artifacts (mostly beads) and 400 sites.

This paper reflects on fifteen years of NAGPRA implementation, framed by the larger context of

preservationist laws dating from the 1880's, established a basic framework for American
archaeology. NAGPRA and related legislation revise this framework to be more collaborative
between Native American tribes and archaeologists, and to value a broader range of connections
between material culture and meaning. NAGPRA represents a renegotiation of interpretive
authority, legal rights, and forms of knowledge, and a prevailing of the anthropological concept of
cultural relativity within the practice of archaeology.

selection in response to reproductive and somatic demands: alliance-forming, exogamous mate-
finding to minimize the risks of inbreeding or male out-ranging due to low population densities,
and food-sharing during late winter resource scarcity. The success of Numic social networks
depended upon a complex of symbolic strategies, including ritual and rock art, that could be
preserved and transmitted intergenerationally.

The Late Glacial paleoecology of the Folsom site (10,500 14C yr B.P.) has been reconstructed
from independent lines of evidence, including records of oxygen and carbon isotopes from fossil
land snails, and carbon and nitrogen isotopes from bison. Using data from bison and snails helps
resolve the inevitable question of whether the bison isotope signature reflects local or distant
conditions. Together, these data reveal a landscape cooler and drier and with a greater
dominance of C4 grasses, than at present. The high incidence of C4 grasses in Late Glacial
times may result from several factors, including lower atmospheric CO2, and differences in
seasonal precipitation patterns; it also has broader implications for Late Glacial paleoecology.

Learning about the basketry technology of prehistoric people can be a challenge due to the poor

how an analysis of the pottery and the basket-impressions can provide information about the
basketry technology of this time period.

sequence in deposits of more than 4.00 meters deep. The successive occupations are composed
of a series of fills, clay floors, rooms and platforms that together form the first archaeological
contexts recovered from this area through scientific excavations in the last 30 years. This paper is
a field report of the work carried out in the area in which the contexts and materials recovered will
be presented as well as preliminary interpretations of the nature of the data obtained.

[152] The Meanings of Mutilation: Interpreting the Scarring of Classic Maya Imagery
The mutilation of Maya sculpture has been neglected in the archaeological literature despite the
frequent appearance of intentionally damaged monuments at many sites. These mutilated
sculptures are usually characterized by systematic and localized patterns of scarring that can
illuminate larger cultural phenomena such as Maya conflict and warfare. This presentation thus
addresses the distribution, methods, and meaning(s) of such monument scarring. It employs lithic
studies and comparative patterns to sketch a general approach towards interpreting sculpture
mutilation, with due emphasis on the difficulties in discerning intention and imputing motive.
Relevant data come from throughout the Maya Lowlands.

[147] Sunken Treasure, Pirate Ships and the Media
Salvagers, scavengers and treasure hunters have searched for and found sunken ships from the
Mediterranean to the Gulf of Mexico and around the world. Ocean going vessels from the ancient
Greeks and Romans to the Spanish conquistadors and even recent world wars capture the
public's imagination with unknown and untold riches. Every discovery from the Titanic to a trimere
brings the thought of long lost gold to mind. Media coverage of these finds fuels the urge to find
more, uncover more and score the treasure. Does media coverage of underwater archaeology,
salvage and scavenge encourage treasure hunters or promote conservation?

[23] Technological and Provenance Variation in Native American Pottery from the Spanish Period
to the American Territorial Period, Tucson, Arizona
Historic O'odham pottery in Tucson was sought after by soldiers, settlers and indigenous people
alike. Petrographic analysis of Historic Period Tucson pottery indicates that paste composition
changed through time. Petrologic analyses and multivariate statistics were used to characterize
the ceramic pastes and assess sand temper provenance against the Tucson Basin petrofacies
model. In A.D. 1700, potters incorporated grog and volcanic sand into their paste. By ca. A.D.
1880, paste was tempered with a fiber and granitic sand mixture. Technological and provenance
variations are related to changes in government and economy as southern Arizona moved from
Spanish to American ownership.

[72] Skeletons, Bones and Skulls in the Art of Chichen Itza, Yucatan
Although a minor theme in earlier Maya monumental art, skeletal imagery became dominant at
Chichen Itza during the Terminal Classic. Skulls and skeletal figures are depicted in all media,
while real human bones served as architectural decoration. While some figures are probably
supernatural or deity impersonators, the skulls represent those of decapitated sacrificial victims.
The new emphasis on graphic death imagery does not necessarily demonstrate increased human
sacrificial activity but rather is a reflection of ideological and political changes requiring the
depersonalization of both captors and captives represented in art as well as large-scale and
intimidating images of Itza power.

raw clays used in the production of local Black-on-White ceramics within the Rio Grande del

diversity and quality of clay sources used by local potters, a trend tied to newly restricted
procurement strategies and the formation of buffer zones between village aggregates.

Despite the inherent problems found within all statewide geographic information systems there
are identifiable spatial patterns in the distribution of prehistoric mounds and earthworks that can

that this change from dispersed to aggregated coincided with a shift in household interaction

[62] Bone Grease Rendering and Factors Underlying Bone Selection
In his study of bison leg fat, Brink (1997) suggested that bone grease weight alone is a more
useful gauge of grease utility than Binford's measure of percentage of oleic acid. However, when
the percentages of parts selected by the Nunamiut for bone grease manufacture are plotted
against bone grease weight in bison legs, two linear relationships, not one, can be distinguished.
These results appear to imply that, in addition to bone grease weight, a second factor, probably
the percentage of oleic acid, also seems to play a significant role in the Nunamiut selection of
bones for grease rendering.

and first millennium B.C. in central Thailand has identified evidence for an increase in metal
production over time. An assemblage of well-preserved faunal remains from the same sites
contains wild mammals, birds, fish, turtles, and domestic mammals. Analysis of the faunal
remains from the same time periods explores links between foraging strategies, animal
husbandry practices, and environmental changes associated with copper production. Results
suggest that wild animal exploitation was replaced by heavier emphasis on domestic resources
over time, especially pig and dog, coterminous with environmental change.

[131] Power and Prey: Faunal Resources and Social Power in a Chacoan Community
An understanding of Puebloan society must include a consideration of the way in which
community social dynamics structured power relations. Excavations at Cox Ranch Pueblo, a
southern Chaco-period community, have yielded faunal remains from several household
middens, a Great House, and the Great House midden. Comparison of the faunal remains from
different areas within the site documents how individuals within the community accessed and
utilized animals. This analysis offers insight into how the use of daily consumables and avian
elements linked to ritual events helped to structure power relations within the community.

cores indicate a change from an open bay to a barrier-enclosed lagoon. We argue these changes
correlate with increased sediment eroded from the Oaxacan highlands during periods of
agricultural and demographic expansion. The cores indicate coastal changes occurred circa 2500
YBP, a date similar to evidence for changes in floodplain geomorphology. This indicates the
synchronous change of floodplain dynamics and coastal change related to anthropogenic effects
in the drainage basin.

This paper presents an overview of and context for new archaeological, paleontological and
anthropological discoveries from the Syrian Palaeolithic sites of Nadaouiyeh, Hummal, Umm el
Tlel (el Kowm region), Jerf Ajle (near Palmyra) and Dederiyeh (north of Aleppo). A "chaine
operatoire" approach to the archaeological material helps to create a coherent and dynamic new
picture of the technical, economic, and social behavior of paleolithic humans. This emerging
information from sites currently under excavation has important implications for the wider regional
reconstruction of the Levantine Paleolithic.

Issues and Future Research Agenda
Sea lions have been one of the main resources used by Holocene hunter-gatherers in Tierra del
Fuego Island, Southern Patagonia. Yet, in spite of their importance, many aspects of this issue
remain to be studied if we are to understand the variability involved in human-pinniped
relationships since the human peopling of the region at the end of the Pleistocene. This
presentation deals with our current knowledge of the problem, introduces new archaeofaunal data
from the Atlantic coast of the island, and discusses different lines of zooarchaeological and
taphonomic inquiry that need to be developed in future.

[130] The Gazelle Project: An Integrative Zooarchaeological Approach to Reconstructing Human-
Gazelle Interactions in the Prehistoric Southern Levant
The gazelle project investigates the evolution of gazelle-human relationships over the last
200,000 years in the southern Levant. Trends in gazelle (Gazella gazella) demographic profiles,
body-size, and relative abundance provide some of the earliest evidence for cultural control of
animal populations, although the gazelle was never domesticated. Human control of gazelles is
important for understanding ungulate domestication in Southwest Asia, yet agreement over the
nature of this control has never been reached. This project reconsiders gazelle exploitation by
combining data from modern gazelle populations with standardized taphonomic, body-size, age,
and sex data from multiple prehistoric sites in the southern Levant.

[98] Social Integration of Puebloan Architecture in the Mogollon Rim Region: An Open Space
Analysis
Architectural space structures social interaction by defining the physical boundaries and spaces
in which people carry out activities of daily life. Open spaces, such as plazas, function
simultaneously as inclusive and exclusive mechanisms influencing the degree of social
integration within Pueblo society. Using methods adapted from Potter‘s (1998) interpretation of
space syntax, we explore the variability of open space in late prehistoric sites in the Mogollon Rim
region. Results suggest that architectural design and village layout contributed to increased
opportunities for social integration following the migrations at the onset of the Early Pueblo IV
period.

[32] The Cultural Context of Arenal Phase Cemeteries in NW Costa Rica
The Arenal phase (early 500 BC-1 AD and late 1-600 AD) is a local expression of the Tempisque
(500 BC-300 AD) period in the cultural sequence of the Northwestern Costa Rica. This period
was characterized by dispersed, emerging village societies, with rapid demographic growth, and
with social differentiation continuously more marked. The data gathered so far do not reflect a
completely sedentary society. Subsistence activities were mainly based in the collection of wild
plants, and in gardening, hunting and fishing. Establishing questions centered on social aspects
of the period, as starting points in the archaeological research, is the way for obtaining a clearer
picture of it.

[4] Seal Butchery and Element Fragmentation Patterns at the Shag Mouth Site, New Zealand
Detailed examination of the Shag Mouth faunal assemblage has shown that overall foraging
efficiency declined significantly as a result of resource depression. Patch choice models predict
that given this decline in foraging efficiency, the intensity with which large prey such as seals
were exploited might have also changed over time. Specifically, changes in the body parts
transported as well as more intensive use of skeletal elements through grease and marrow
extraction through time are expected. Data indicate that foraging efficiency declined significantly
enough to affect seal carcass exploitation, but did not result in more intensive use individual
skeletal elements.

[100] Siteless Survey and Intensive Data Collection in an Artifact-rich Environment: Case Studies
from the Eastern Korinthia, Greece
Archaeological survey in the Mediterranean has become increasingly intensive over the last 20
years, producing more variable and complex data sets and allowing more sophisticated
reconstructions of regional histories. Yet more intensive methods have refocused the scope of
Mediterranean surveys from "region" to "micro-region," consequently inviting criticism for not
addressing research questions framed by a large-scale, regional perspectives rooted in analytical
categories of "settlement" and "site." This paper uses results from a "siteless" survey in southern
Greece to show how more intensive data sets can produce a valuable contribution to 'big picture'

The Upper Paleolithic assemblages dated ca. 21,000 - 18,000 B.P. (the Last Glacial Maximum) in

decades, are characterized by diversity in stone tool classes. We examine the question whether
the empirically recognized diversity among the LGM lithic assemblages is explained by sample
size effect and/or behavioral variables including occupational intensity and redundancy, duration
of site occupation, and raw material availability. Richness and evenness are employed to
measure assemblage diversity. Our examination will contribute to understanding assemblage

The Pacific Coast of Guatemala is a well-watered, fertile region where archaeological remains

High-resolution climatic records from mangrove sediments demonstrate substantial variation in
rainfall beginning about 5000 years ago. A prolonged dry and variable period between about
4000 and 3000 years ago coincided with the appearance of sedentary villages of the Early

during a long period of favorable conditions from about 2800 years ago until 1000 years ago. Dry
and variable conditions after about 1000 AD brought collapse.

in ceramic production and distribution. The kinds of interactions represented by ceramic type-
frequency distributions would be more domestic in nature and more appropriately related to the
social economies of potters.

This poster shows how correspondence analysis can be combined with Bayesian spatial
smoothing to resolve quadrat counts of ceramic classes into a few gradients. The data come from
two adjacent sites at Monticello, occupied by slaves and overseers during the second half of the

with a prior distribution based on its surrounding neighborhood using Bayes‘ theorem. The
methods reveal that spatial patterns in ceramic frequencies at these sites are controlled by two
factors: time and resource access. We highlight the links between our analysis and frequency

Despite best intentions, stewardship is rarely the neutral presence it purports to be. In promoting

often questioned the capability, values, and responsibilities of descendant peoples having
differing opinions about the past. There are also potential contradictions within the SAA Principles

An archaeological project that was conducted in May and June 2004 at the site Cardonal, located
in the Valley of Cajón, northwestern Argentina, yielded valuable information to understand an
indigenous way of life in the Andes during the Formative Period. One of the intriguing aspects at
this newly excavated site can be pursued in the concentrations of recintos -- habitation/corral
structures with stone walls. Geographical features of the site and distribution patterns of artifacts
(e.g., ceramic shards, lithics, and mortars) suggest that those recinto concentrations might have
been purposefully constructed to facilitate exchange activities among local communities.

[125] Cultural Transformation of late Neolithic Inner Mongolia
Excavations of Neolithic habitation sites and burials as well as Bronze Age burials have made it
possible for archaeologists to establish local cultural history. Late Neolithic non-Longshan phase
pottery vessels and burials have been overlooked largely because of the dominance of "regional
filiations of cultural phases" approach. However, those non-Longshan materials are essential to
the understanding of interactions among agro-pastoralist communities in the area. In this paper,
shared stylistic similarities of late Neolithic cultures between south-central Inner Mongolia and
northwestern China are discussed. It is suggested that cultural stasis of Neolithic Inner Mongolia
was finally altered by the pastoralists.

[101] Mid-Holocene Terrestrial Animal Use in the Gulf of Georgia Region: A Case Study from the
Ferndale Site (45-WH-34)
Human subsistence in the Gulf of Georgia region changed considerably in resource focus during
the mid-Holocene from generalized to increasingly marine. The Ferndale fauna elucidate
terrestrial animal use during this transitional period on the lower Nooksack River in northwest
Washington. The site yielded 5,703 mammal and avian remains representing at least 14
mammalian and 11 avian taxa. Bone surface modification and element representation indicate
that deer and elk carcasses were transported from the field whole but appear to have been
processed differently once at the settlement. Systematic breakage patterns suggest that beaver
were processed for both meat and pelts.

Shrines and Book of Mormon Archaeology Interest
To embrace the global archaeology within the Mormon Church, both the Church's historic sites

scriptural history, must be considered. A study of contrasts is to be found between these two
domains of Mormon historical archaeology. Significant differences also exist between the

[163] Prehistoric Obsidian Sources and Utilization in the Kyushu Island, Japan
About 30 obsidian sources are known in Kyushu Island that were exploited and utilized in
prehistoric time. The source with the most abundant and best quality of obsidian as material of
stone tools is the Koshidake Mountain in Imari City, Northwestern Kyushu. The Koshidakean
obsidian began to be utilized 30,000 y.B.P. and spread widely around Kyushu Island about 9,000
y.BP. Later beyond the inland region Koshidakean Obsideian were transported by the ship to the
Ryukyu Islands and the southern coast area of the Korean Peninsula in the later half
 of Jomon Priod. The geo-chemical analysis done recently have proved and emphasized this
story more clearly and strongly.

hunter-gatherer settlement patterns, the diffusion of agriculture, sexual selection as a determinant
of prey choice, and the development of social hierarchies. Topics explored by other contributors

[66] Re-use vs. Abandonment of Inca Sites and Infrastructure and the Transition to Spanish Rule
in Southern Highland Ecuador
Archaeological investigation of Inca provincial sites (administrative centers, military installations,
etc.) and related infrastructure (roads, way stations, etc.) is essential to the analysis of Inca
strategies of control over and exploitation of local populations and resources. By considering
whether these sites and elements of infrastructure were re-used or abandoned during the early
colonial period, we can likewise gain insights into how Spanish strategies of control corresponded
with or differed from those of the Incas. This paper presents a case where archaeological data
from the southern highlands of Ecuador reveal major shifts during the transition from Inca to
Spanish rule.

[13] Aztec Imperial Boundary Dynamics at Cuetlaxtlan, Veracruz
The Cuetlaxtlan province, at the eastern edge of the Aztec empire, provides an interesting case
for examining Postclassic period sociopolitical boundary dynamics and their material implications.
The provincial capital of Cuetlaxtlan (Cotaxtla) actively resisted imperial rule through a series of
rebellions against the Aztecs, making it a locale of contested social and political identity.
Archaeological survey and surface collection at Cotaxtla reveal Aztec imperial strategies for
asserting and maintaining political identity that include transforming local architecture, economy,
ideology, and ethnicity at Cotaxtla. Comparisons to other Postclassic frontiers underscore the
flexibility in boundary maintenance strategies and their resultant material remains.

Cinder cones are the most abundant terrestrial volcanic landform. Their environmental effects are
less widespread than other types of eruptions, but they commonly occur as "new volcanoes" in
areas where people live and farm, often producing locally catastrophic consequences. Analyses
of three prehistoric and modern eruptions (Sunset Crater and Little Springs in Arizona, and
Parícutin in Michoacán) show that choices made by affected groups resulted in different adaptive
responses at each volcano. These choices were based upon a complex mix of variables,
including the nature of the eruption and the surrounding environment, and the culture of the

[97] Mapping out the World of the Lower Sand Canyon Community
One of the clearest ways archaeologists can perceive the interplay of structure and agency in the

maintain origin narratives that explain what the world is and how it came to be. But it is not always
straightforward to relate the idealized cosmologies of origin narratives to the real, empirical world.
People must decide how to do this if they want to promote a particular place as the right place for
their community. This paper presents a concrete example of this process from 13th century

We explore cities as long-lasting socially significant entities through the comparison of Rome and

its reinvention as a religious and political capital in centuries subsequent to its original collapse is

can aid in assessing cultural affiliation. Information obtained from the remains furnish details
about the way individuals lived, died, and were treated after death, which aid the affiliated tribe in

scientists must ally material culture analysis with the proficiencies of participant observer. Further,
research is seldom free of post-colonial politics, making archaeologists interlocutors between
academic integrity, social action, and the sedimentation of activities - especially storytelling - at
rock-art sites. This scientific-indigenous-political approach transcends political correctness by
creating a matrix of enabling and constraining data that represents better science. Three cross-

human selection in the past. This major selective force took place between 600-1700 AD with the
Tairona/Kaggaba. The data presented support this interpretation on the historical ecology of
tropical cloud forests. Similar processes took place in all of the tropical cloud forests of the Andes,
where complex societies modified in an irreversible form the structure of the forest.

objective was to integrate the prehistoric inhabitants of the Caribbean to the archaeological
narrative as active beings who created a different culture from their South American antecessors.
The utilization of agency results in a personal narrative that reflects life tensions and
contradictions. Agency allows archaeological research to identify the different intra-Caribbean
dynamics of power and economy.

[19] Investigations into Middle Period Fishing Economy of Western Santa Cruz Island
Several models have been proposed for the development of sociopolitical complexity during or

implied that the intensified exploitation of fish enabled island populations to sustain themselves
during this period of documented climatic upheaval and resource depression. However, there has
been little investigation of what made rapid intensification possible. This paper explores the
relationship between subsistence intensification and innovations in fishing technology by focusing
upon diachronic change in archaeological fish assemblages from Middle period sites found on the

Visible residues are frequently found in prehistoric ceramic cooking vessels or interior pottery

Percussion knapping of a biface produces about 50 flakes. Reported artifact inventories from
excavated sites produce similar estimates. The correspondence of solutions suggests that it is
possible to account for virtually all flakes, as stone was moved from quarry to deposition site.
Improved data collection and reporting strategies should help us resolve whether Folsom people
utilized their lithic resources steadily, or in intensive gearing-up sessions.

[153] The Turn to Agency: Neoliberalism, Individuality, and Subjectivity in Late Twentieth-Century
Anglophone Archaeology
This paper examines the turn to agency theory in the 1980s and its relation to the formulation and
implementation of neoliberal policies in the mid-1970s and the concomitant rise of postmodernist
perspectives on individuality and subjectivity. The adoption of agency theory involved the
rejection of popular functionalist and structuralist perspectives that gave priority to the object
(culture or society) over the subject, viewed individuals as the passive bearers of structures, and
overlooked the free will and knowledgeability of actors. It also underwrote renewed interest in the
issues of power and power relations.

[161] Adoption of Animal Husbandry at Pimeria Alta Missions
Documentary evidence from the Southwest indicates that Spanish missionaries attempted to alter
the subsistence base of southwestern native peoples through the introduction of Eurasian
domestic animals. Our understanding of the degree to which this strategy was successful is
hindered by a dearth of zooarchaeological evidence. Excavations in southern Arizona at the 18th-
century mission San Jose de Tumacecori and the late 18th-century mission San Agustin del
Tucson, provide an opportunity to examine southwestern Native American subsistence during the
early colonial period in the Pimeria Alta. Zooarchaeological analysis suggests that efforts to
encourage animal husbandry among missionized Native Americans were more successful than in
other colonial regions.

[43] Tropical Farmers: 35,000 Years in the Lowland Rainforests of West New Britain, Papua New
Guinea
The lowland tropical rainforest of West New Britain were entered and colonised more than 35,000
years ago. From this time onward the rainforest dwellers harnessed and utilised important inland
resources and locales. By looking closely at the organisation of flaked stone technologies during
the Pleistocene and Holocene it becomes apparent that this rainforest society was radically
transformed between 10,000 ands 3,600 years ago. Furthermore, the main elements of social
and economic organisation usually associated with later agricultural settlers within the region
were already in place in the rainforest by at least 4000 years ago. Using evidence from flaked
stone both the configuration and direction of social change within Papua New Guinea's dynamic
rainforest will be explored.

[57] Results of an Investigation of Ridge-top Residential Sites in American Samoa
In 2004, archaeologists from Texas A&M University undertook a single-season exploration of
mountain residential sites In American Samoa, in order to determine their age. Three large
abandoned mountain residential sites were selected for inclusion in the study. Seven radiocarbon
dates were obtained, four of which ostensibly date the period of initial construction of the
settlements. A chi-square of these reveals that they are statistically identical at the 95%
confidence Interval. The pooled mean conventional age is 680±20 B.P. When calibrated, this
suggests that mountain settlement began in Tutuila between 1270-1310 A.D., possibly
representing a major shift in settlement patterns.

Archaeologists have had a difficult time finding stratified evidence for late glacial and early

these finds in the light of the changing environment of Central America and recent debates about
the nature and timing of human migrations through the isthmus.

resources. This correlation is found in other western and northern Great Basin areas. House rings
and grinding equipment preside in the area, along with a generalized lithic tool kit, thus task
groups included women and children. The petroglyphs are archaeological features strongly
associated with the house rings and some concentrated milling areas. The seasonal upland field

[119] King Alfred, King Canute, and the Codfish
Zooarchaeology and isotopic signatures of human bones from Britain, Norway, and Iceland
strongly indicate that between AD 850 and 1100 a revolution took place in the commercial
ecology of cod fishing and dried fish production. Scandinavian fishers and elites dating back to
the Iron Age had developed a production strategy and a distribution network which was taken into
the N Atlantic after AD 800. Inland sites in 9th -10th c Iceland and human isotopic signatures
demonstrate the importance of this pre-Hanseatic, chiefly fish trade among Viking Age settlers.
Contemporary Pictish, Anglian, and Hebridean populations did not possess a comparable
tradition, and consumption of preserved inland fish and a fully commercial fish trade begins only
after significant Scandinavian settlement and political dominance of much of Britain. This new
inter-regional synthesis demonstrates that the Historical Ecology of N Atlantic fishing is a product
of the Viking age.

[97] The Construction of Gender Identity in Prehispanic Pueblo Communities
This paper proposes that identity - the product of gender construction - results from the structured
performance of labor activities in prehispanic Pueblo communities. Osteological reconstructions
of sexually differentiated activity patterns are used to examine the interaction between sex and
gender and the role of embodiment in the formation of identity. Gender identity is constructed
though daily practice in the habitual embodied performances that occur continuously within the
context of a Pueblo community. The dissonance created through these social processes
inevitably produces bodies that fail to achieve the performative ideal; such cases are brought into
focus through this study.

How responses to population-resource imbalances influenced subsequent settlement and

to researchers on the California Islands. The nature and specific roles of such episodes have
been debated vigorously using a variety of paleoenvironmental and archaeological data.
However, what has not been considered fully is how environmental variability shaped the
particular manifestations of climatic events. Citing data from multiple California Islands, I focus on
long-term drought, proposing that responses may have varied from abandonment to
circumscription and intensified exchange depending on island-specific environmental and
demographic factors.

preferential treatment for funding. These results are compared with those from the SAA survey to

All societies contain individuals who seek to elevate themselves and dominate others. These
'aggrandizers' attain prominence and power through inducing and expropriating others' productive
surpluses, converting them through various means into social prestige. Specific households may
increase their status within their communities to the extent that ambitious members can mobilize
goods and labor towards this end. A commonly suggested strategy of accumulation is productive
specialization. Variability in surface artifact assemblages is used to evaluate the importance of
different economic pursuits to interhousehold social differentiation and the emergence of the
earliest social hierarchies in the Chifeng region of eastern Inner Mongolia.

[112] Caves and Settlement in the Sibun Valley
The close relationship of the ancient Maya of the Sibun Valley of Central Belize to caves is
documented by artifact deposition in these features. The relationship between caves and
settlement, however, is always mediated by local geomorphological conditions. The settled
alluvial plain is distinct from areas of uninhabited steep-sided cone karst where caves are located.
Cave utilization thus appears to be analogous to the Maya highlands where caves and
settlements are physically separated by the mountainous terrain. This paper will explore the role
of geology in determining strategies of utilization and appropriation of particular sacred sites.

Ranging from large hearths to small charcoal pits, the features at Dust Cave are in-situ
representations of the occupants‘ activities. We examine these activities through feature function,
using a combination of geochemical, micromorphological, and archaeobotanical analyses. Our
data suggest that while the Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic occupations are similar,
significant changes occurred between the Early and Middle Archaic, including new feature types,
greater feature diversity, increased nutshell, and increased occupation intensity. These changes
may be associated with a focus on hickory nut processing, which led to more intensive
occupation and repeated use of Dust Cave as a special-purpose site.

But that shift varied significantly depending on regional variables. The issue I address is whether
that shift was, in fact, a truly "major" event in the Southern Rocky Mountains, an environment
capable of buffering climatic change through shifts in ecological zone boundaries. Specifically, I
address whether the archaeological records of late Paleoindian versus Archaic sites in the
Southern Rockies do differ from each other, and if so, how.

from the 1870s until well after 1920. City ordinances, sewer connect records and other historical
documents are compared with archaeological information to provide unique insights into the

inscriptions, potential architectural treatises or conventions of linear progressionism. Khmer
temples‘ possess distinct spatial signatures, both of design elements and dimensions in which
discontinuity reveals aspects of indigenous architectural transformation and innovation.

potential to located distinct cultural features and take the guess work out of where to place formal

(9MC372). The goal was to locate cultural features and make Phase II site testing more
productive. The results of this investigation are provided as a prime example of how GPR can be
effectively utilized to investigate archaeological sites.

[135] Do Chains Make Good Bridges? Applying Technological Choice to Archaeological Ceramic
Assemblages
Behavioral and cultural approaches to technological choice grounded in actualistic research offer
important insights into the causes and implications of variation in ceramic assemblages. Neither,
however, has yet found wide application in archaeological studies of pottery manufacture by U.S.
archaeologists. This paper draws on the author's research in Veracruz, Mexico to examine
difficulties in applying the behavioral and techniques e culture approaches to archaeological
cases, focusing on critical links in the inferential chain, among them: establishing the domain of
"choice," inferring relevant dimensions of social identity, and weighting physical and social
performance characteristics.

[95] Microlithic Technology, Household Economy, and Community Interaction in Early
Mississippian Farming Communities
Salvage excavations at the Pfeffer site in the Cahokia region resulted in the recovery of an Early
Mississippian house and related features containing large numbers of chert microlithic tools. We
conducted microwear analysis on a sample of these tools and demonstrate that the tools were
used to work not only with shell but also with other materials. Drawing together research from
other Mississippian contexts of production, we consider matters of household economy and daily
life, within broader community contexts that focus on art technology and social networks.

[25] Sourcing Red Ochres by Instrumental Trace Analysis
Red ochres are ubiquitous on many North American archaeological sites, and are found in cave
artwork, mortuary contexts, and other ceremonial milieu. Because of their importance, certain
ochre pigments may have been traded from site to site for their unique qualities. To date, ochre
pigments have not been well characterized by elemental methods. This project analyzes red
ochres from several sources using instrumental trace analysis techniques, including neutron
activation analysis (NAA), particle induced x-ray emission (PIXE), x-ray fluorescence
spectrometry (XRF). Multivariate statistical analyses of the data indicate geochemical trends in
the ochre sources that satisfy the provenance postulate.

[81] The Mesoamerican Preclassic: A View from the South Coast of Guatemala
Since the 1977 publication by Gareth Lowe regarding the Mixe-Zoque as competing neighbors of
the early Lowland Maya, considerable advances have been made towards understanding the
Preclassic period on the South Coast of Guatemala. The information indicates that the spread of
Olmec and Maya styles in this region was due mainly to commercial relations but that
scientific/ideological concepts were also a substantial component in the interaction. There is little
evidence of Mixe-Zoque ethnic intrusion into Guatemala during the Preclassic period. The talk
summarizes the current information from Guatemala.

[97] Agency and (pit)Structure: Negotiating Identity in Early Northern-Southwest Villages
Early villages in the northern Southwest are notable for their relatively short occupation spans
and for the variety of strategies employed to integrate newly aggregated social units. A major
challenge to the stability of these early communities was that households often derived from
different areas of the Southwest with diverse cultural traditions, histories, and cultural capital.
Using data from Ridges Basin in Colorado, this paper examines the agency of early Pueblo I
households within the structure of a multi-ethnic "aggregated landscape" and how material
culture, especially pit structure architecture, played a role in negotiating household identity.

seemed as limited as the canyon was isolated. One archaeologist who thought otherwise was R.
Gwinn Vivian. Growing up in the Canyon, Gwinn was one of the few who had seen the Chacoan

more complex, and more anomalous than anyone realized. In this paper we explore Gwinn‘s
prescient ideas and how they have shaped modern conceptions of Chaco.

This study responds to Klaus Helfrich's seminal work on Maya human sacrifice and presents its
underlying ritual concepts in a new key, regarding occision simply as one of many alternatives in
the ritual treatment of the human body. Following Pierre Bourdieu and Robert Merton, rituals are
viewed as sociocultural and motivation directed strategies of a group. Despite their unified
objectives, body-modifications suffered a great diversification in forms of body modifications,
expressing systemic dysfunctions and social change. In this light, I will discuss objectives and
meanings in the treatment of the human body and their spatio-temporal expressions in Classic
Maya society.

[20] Writing the Pueblo Revolt
Among the most important contributions of Postcolonial theory has been the critique of history as
written from the point of view of the colonizer. This critique is not simply a plea for some "total
history" that adds in the perspectives of the colonized. Rather it draws attention to how colonial
representations and modes of perception are used as weapons of power to maintain the colonial
relationship. In my presentation, I focus on how the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 has been written. I
contrast the work of the Borderlands historians with that of Pueblo Indian scholars. I suggest that
there has been a systematic, albeit unconscious, devaluing of indigenous values and beliefs. I
then suggest the possibility of different histories written by indigenous scholars and, where
appropriate, in collaboration with Western scholars as a means of reclaiming cultural identities. I
also provide some examples that suggest that Southwestern archaeology is taking the lead in this
"writing back to the center."

individuals found in contexts of sacrifice. The results document both long-distance homelands

were important Precolumbian pilgrimage destinations with implications for political and religious
organization. The presence of materials from across the Maya Lowlands in caves near rural
mountain communities links this region to more cosmopolitan neighbors. It also suggests that
dramatic religious landscapes lend prestige value to communities and were considered important

Mormons' interest in archaeology began in the 1840s, but was centered on finding evidence of

discipline at large. Further, the Church's archaeological research plays an important role in the

During nearly four millennia, Capsian foragers occupied the high plains of eastern Algeria and
southern Tunisia, during which time they developed a very successful adaptation to a semi-arid

abrupt environmental shift, a technological change occurred that lead to major social
transformations. Capsian toolmakers adopted a new technique of knapping to produce microliths
and also diversified their toolkit. In this presentation we explore the Upper Capsian chaîne

Sacralization of formerly widespread behaviors or objects is a pervasive feature of the human
experience. The transformation of once-common traits into markers of esoteric knowledge often
gets caught up in sociopolitical dynamics, and is subject to exploitation by elites. Such a process
may have involved two kinds of ceramics in ancient China: Middle Neolithic painted pottery, and
the ding tripod of Neolithic and later times. Research in the Yuanqu Basin of north-central China
suggests that each of these ceramic types were widely accessible early on in their evolutionary
life spans, but their manufacture and use became increasingly restricted over time.

Settlement Record
Pueblo population change through the early colonial period bridges prehistory and more recent

from assumptions regarding residential permanence at aggregated settlements and reliance on
incomplete documentary records. Our method uses both aggregated and small settlements in the
Rio Grande corridor to assess population change. The results are unexpected and important:
small settlements are founded coincident with large settlement abandonment following Spanish
colonization. This increase suggests that residential mobility continues into the historic period.
Dispersion, not population decline, best accounts for the abandonment of aggregated
settlements.

Sinagua into a Northern group (located near present day Flagstaff) and a Southern group
(located in the Verde Valley) based on architectural styles and certain aspects of the material
culture. Did the prehistoric Sinagua see the cultural division between North and South? Did they
work to maintain or diffuse the differences? This paper explores the prehistoric reality of the
Northern-Southern Sinagua division through an analysis and comparison of textiles from both
areas.

[9] Phased Lithic Reduction and Late Pleistocene Mobility in Interior Alaska
Analysis of a systemic toolkit from 49KAT6, a Late Pleistocene site in interior Alaska, reveals the
presence of multiple, intertwining production sequences and strategies. The presence of bag
wear on flakes, blanks, preforms, and finished tools reveals that objects in all phases of
manufacture were transported and that lithic tool production was a staged, intermittent activity
occurring over weeks or months as people traveled around the landscape. Such a tool
manufacturing strategy suggests problems with an approach that uses type-sites to define
cultural complexes, as has been common in Alaskan archaeology.

[58] The Mold Impressed Wares of Teotihuacan
Mold Impressed wares are an indicator of Teotihuacan's final phase. The technique appears on
locally manufactured vessels, sometimes with elaborate pictorial content such as those on the
famous Calpulalpan bowl rendered in pure Teotihuacan style; Gulf Coast and Mayan imports
recovered from Teotihuacan Mapping Project collections; and examples with Mayan and Gulf
Coast designs from the Merchant's Barrio excavations. Elaborate mold impressed designs in
Teotihuacan style also appear on the distinctive applique designs of some imported Thin Orange
pots. Human figures and glyph-like signs are common and give us new insights. A reappraisal of
this iconography will be attempted.

[150] Subsistence Transformation and Thermal Pretreatment of Lithic Raw Materials
It has been proposed that as changes in subsistence occur, modifications in tool manufacture,
such as heat treatment of stone material, often coincide. A lithic analysis performed on data from
the Schultz site, a stratified Early through Late Woodland occupation in Saginaw County,
Michigan, shows an increased use of heat treatment during a period of intensification on wetland
resources. Evidence for greater use of thermal alteration is seen in the number of heat treated
flakes as well as in the presence of heat treatment facilities.

[40] The Early Archaic Sequence at the Big Eddy Site in Missouri
Excavations at the Big Eddy site in 2001 and 2002 focused on thick stratified Early Archaic
deposits in the middle submember of the Rodgers Shelter formation. Rapid aggradation of alluvial
sediments during early-middle Holocene times buried and isolated multiple Early Archaic
components in stratigraphic and temporally distinct alluvial deposits. The result was the formation
of one of the most complete and distinct chronostratigraphic records of the Early Archaic period in
the Midwest. An up-to-date summary of radiocarbon and projectile point chronology associated
with six Early Archaic components is discussed.

[92] The Domestication of Sheep and Goats, Milking and the Origin of Pastoralism - Three
Problems and One Answer?
I have argued that in the initial phase of the shift to food production captured wild sheep and
goats were retained and bred as insurance - a risk reduction tactic - while hunting wild taxa was
the primary strategy. The shift to full domestication occurred when net yields from the retained
proto-domesticates exceeded net yields from hunting. It is argued that the most likely bigger for
this event was the use of milk. The early use of domestic sheep and goats for milk as well as
meet would have made a pastoral strategy energetically viable for the human population.

[152] The Gender Implications of Sweatbath Use and Change
The use of sweatbath structures is relatively common within domestic and ritual life in the
highlands of present-day Mesoamerica and appears also to have been common in both domestic
and public contexts throughout prehistoric Mesoamerica. Sweatbath function can be varied: from
simple cleansing of the body, to rituals conducted by men and associated with the Mesoamerican
ballgame, to ritual cleansing by women after childbirth. Using ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and
archaeological data on sweatbaths, this discussion will elaborate on changes in sweatbath
function through time and how these changes affected women and men's roles in society.

[139] Early Puebloan Villages and Communities across the Greater San Juan Basin
Dramatic changes occurred from AD 200-900 (late Basketmaker II through Pueblo I) in Puebloan
groups across the greater San Juan Basin. During this time, the first villages developed and the
foundation for all subsequent Puebloan developments, including those in Chaco Canyon, was
laid. Considerable evolution in architecture, settlement patterns, ritual practices, economy, and
sociopolitical organization is apparent in the archaeological record. This paper explores this
critical period in Pueblo history, focusing on multiple aspects of the progression from single-
household sites to simple villages, and, finally, to large, aggregated communities after AD 850.

[54] Warrior Queens among the Classic Maya
Few women are associated with warfare in Maya art, and when depicted, are shown most
frequently in supporting roles. However, stelae from Calakmul, Coba, Naachtun, and Naranjo
portray queens as warriors in their own right. In these carved monuments, warrior queens stand
atop captives, assuming positions of power in compositions accentuating conquest. Moreover,
each of the Calakmul and Naachtun stelae is paired with another depicting the king in the same
pose in order to emphasize the corresponding roles played by both queen and king. This paper
discusses these examples of warrior queens among the Classic Maya and the context in which
they arose.

Drawing on stable isotopes, zooarchaeology, climate modeling, and modern analogy, we review
and interpret the archaeological record for fisheries along the Peruvian coast. Exploitation of
mollusks, crustaceans, fish, sea birds, and sea mammals began in the Terminal Pleistocene, so
this region has one of the longest archaeological fisheries records available in the Americas. In
contrast to many world areas where prehistoric fisheries had notable impacts on local marine
ecology, multiple lines of evidence suggest that for Peru, the biotic effects of natural variability in
the marine climate (driven largely by variation in ENSO frequency) predominate over
anthropogenic effects. In reviewing the record, we consider the human response to such
variability in terms of settlement pattern, social organization, and technology.

[89] Using Cultural Algorithms to Model Social Evolution
The Cultural Algorithm is an evolutionary computational model derived from the Cultural Evolution
Process. The experience of individual agents in a social population is used to generate cultural
knowledge in a Belief Space. The knowledge is stored, reasoned about, and manipulated within
the space. This Cultural Knowledge can in turn affect the social population. Thus, the population
component and the belief space interact with, and support each other as a dual inheritance
system. It provides a general framework within which to describe complex adaptive systems.
Examples of how Cultural Algorithms are used to model problems of interest to archaeologists
are presented.

[148] Type-variety: What Works and What Doesn't
The type-variety system of pottery classification is useful for some purposes and less useful for
others. Part of the problem may be that in the decades since the system was first proposed for
use in the Maya area, the practice of both archaeology and ceramic analysis have changed. In
the case of Postclassic pottery from the central Peten lakes (Guatemala), type-variety has
revealed certain structural parallels in the decorative program. These prompt interesting
questions about social relationships among the peoples making and using the pottery, questions
that I'm not sure would have been raised otherwise.

Account for the Possible Pitfalls in Analysis
Due to the highly variable state of the preservation of the organic materials that archaeologists

ambiguous. Sherds from a Hohokam site in Marana (Arizona) are analyzed by gas
chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) at different stages of their excavation and
accession to determine to what extent these processes affect the degradation of the fatty acid
residues preserved in the sherd. Preliminary results indicate that fatty acids, particularly the
unsaturated acids, do not degrade at the same rates which is of great importance to the analysis
and its interpretation.

Tancah and numerous other caves and cenotes in the vicinity. Subsequent interpretations benefit
from an increased understanding of the role of caves among the ancient Maya and acknowledge

The similarity of many Upper Paleolithic cave depictions is often attributed to a similarity in

millennia. To explain this phenomenon it may be better to think in terms of physical imitation
rather than a pervasive authorial intent. This perspective would consider panels of depictions not
as one phenomenon but as an aggregation of phenomena. Instead of searching for one all

When archaeological sites in the Great Basin and Sonoran Desert lie on desert pavement
surfaces, clearings in the desert pavement are often recorded as cultural features. Excavations
have shown that cleared circles can be the partially buried remnants of prehistoric roasting pits,

older sites contained more completely healed, and less visible cleared circles, than features
recorded at younger sites. This paper reviews the desert pavement healing process, identifies
natural processes that result in cleared circles, and develops a framework to evaluate whether
these features are natural or cultural.

surface analyses along with digital mapping of specific sites to examine relationships between
rock-art, terrain, and other archaeological sites/features. Thus, macro and micro aspects of
human engagements with paths and places are integrated to explicate contexts of travel and
dwelling for the Emgidiano and the rock-art they produced.

[91] From Classic to Postclassic in the Central Petén Lakes: Systemic Effects of Regional
Collapse on Continuing Populations
Recent research at the Terminal Classic through Early Postclassic hamlet of San Jeronimo II on
the western shore of Lake Petén-Itzá has identified several effects of the larger regional
‗Collapse‘ on a population that declined but persisted as an organized group into the Postclassic
period. Particular attention is paid to shifts in settlement organization, external economic ties, and
social organization, though continuities are also addressed. The primary focus lies on the
adjustments made by Maya commoners to significant political disruptions and demographic
declines, and especially the likely role of refugees in forcing a shift in settlement patterns.

[36] Results of Recent Investigations at Roadside Cave, Near Craters of the Moon, Southeastern
Idaho
Roadside Cave is a partially collapsed lava tube located south of Big Southern Butte. Severely
vandalized, the Idaho Falls District BLM determined to remediate the damage, protect the
remaining cultural deposits, and return the cave floor to a more natural appearance. To
accomplish this three test units adjacent to the disturbed area were excavated, recovering lithic
tools, sherds, bone tools, and other items. Initial faunal analysis indicates the presence of various
mammals, birds, and reptiles. Ongoing analyses indicate that the site was used by late Archaic
groups for hunting, processing, tool manufacture, and that it still retains intact deposits.

[47] Cooking Fashions in Colonial Mexico
Spanish colonizers introduced lead glazing techniques to Mexico. Over the course of the
sixteenth and seventeenth centuries lead-glazed cookware became a cooking fashion of sorts
among indigenous people. Did the need to acquire this new popular style of pottery affect
household integration with the wider economy and society? By examining ethnohistoric accounts
and studying patterns of exchange of plain and glazed cooking vessels from colonial Xaltocan
one may elucidate the ways in which cooking activities, normally imagined as private and
inconsequential for the economy or social change, were integrated with the wider economy and
public life in a colonial town.

[125] Empire Strategies: Forms of Continuity and Control in Eastern Inner Asia
The states and empires originating in the eastern steppe of Inner Asia often played a central role
in Asian and World history. Given continuities in cultural and economic practices, especially the
legitimation of authority, the construction of order becomes critical in understanding how
organizational coherence emerges. In particular, the methods for constructing order are important
because of the perceived ephemeral and unsustainable nature of the steppe polities. This
perspective is contradicted by recent analyses of cultural continuity, economic patterns, and the
strategies used by polities to maintain control.

[129] Construction Techniques and Regional Identities: Recent Evidence from Las Canoas,
Chamelecon Drainage, Northwestern Honduras
Residents of Las Canoas, located between the Naco and Cacaulapa valleys, exported red-on-
natural pottery to both. Using symbols to assess allegiances, pottery suggests affiliation with
Naco; site planning weakly supports this. Looking at individual structures, there are few definite
clues to identity in final-phase construction, although earlier versions of some structures show
construction techniques and spatial arrangements (rooms and entries) essentially identical to
Classic period Naco architecture. Combining strands of evidence suggest that Las Canoas‘
primary Classic affiliation was with the valley to its north, but, with time, residents became
independent craftworkers beholden to the elite of neither zone.

[78] From al-Jafr to el-Kowm: The Lacustrine Corridor and the Acheulian in the Eastern Levant
The hyperarid landscapes of eastern Jordan and Syria clearly reflect the presence of permanent
bodies of water that existed during the Middle and Late Pleistocene. These lakes range from al-
Mudawwara on the Jordan-Saudi border to el-Kowm in the central Syrian desert. They varied
considerably in size and duration, from the immense Lake al-Jafr and Lake Azraq at one end of
the spectrum to smaller bodies of water at Qa‘a al-Hasa and Qa‘a al-Jinz in east-central Jordan.
The combination of permanent water, plentiful local vegetation, and herds of browsers and
grazers provided a lucrative route for hunting groups who migrated between Africa and Eurasia.

[38] Agents among Us: Social Change and External Contacts in the Masaya Region, Pacific
Nicaragua
The role of migration in social change has received most of the attention in the reconstruction of
Nicaraguan prehistory, especially as it pertains to the last centuries before European contact
(1522 C.E.). Recent data from the Masaya region suggests that there are clear differences
among neighboring communities in terms of regional settlement patterns, development
trajectories and artifact distributions from early on in the local sequence. This may indicate that
factors other than migration were more influential over time. Thus, the uncritically accepted role
attributed to autochthonous populations, regional interaction and external contacts will be
reconsidered.

[98] Mobile Farmers? Assessing Variability in Occupation and Food Production during the Early
Pithouse Period
This paper discusses recent excavations at Hall Point, an Early Pithouse Period (AD 200-600)
site, in the eastern Mogollon Rim area. Specifically, this paper addresses regional variation in
food production and mobility using preliminary evidence from Hall Point and comparative data
from Mogollon pithouse sites. Architectural and assemblage variability are evaluated in light of
recent discussions concerning low-level food production and pithouse occupations. This
approach embraces variability induced by occupation and abandonment processes and eschews
dualistic conceptualizations of food production that obscure variability in ancient plant economies.

Recent handheld GPS survey in the environs of the double-peaked rhyolitic dome of Sahankaya,
or Falcon Rock, in northern Lydia, provides a new understanding of its significance. Despite
published visits to the site dating from the 17th to the 20th centuries, much had gone unnoticed.
Newly discovered features include megalithic walls; an ashlar-built well; numerous rock-cut
features, including a possible fire-altar of Persian type; and the foundations of a watchtower.
These finds, in addition to other Persian period finds in the vicinity, suggest Sahankaya was a

[121] Evolutionary Culture Theory and the Limitations of Reductionism
Reductionism has proven a powerful tool in the physical sciences and often almost equally
powerful in the natural sciences. To the degree that human beings are biological organisms,
reductionism has also been a sometimes-useful conceptual framework for evolutionary
approaches within Anthropology. However, humans are also cultural beings. And, cultural
systems, even more so than biological systems, have emergent properties that do not necessarily
reduce to their constituent components. The reductionism of some evolutionary approaches in
Anthropology has hindered their full development as Anthropology. They must move beyond
simple reductionism if they are to develop their full Anthropological potential.

[50] Beyond Identifying Elites: Feasting as a Means to Understand Early Middle Formative

Among pre-state societies feasts provide a public forum where social statuses can be affirmed or

expected material patterns of feasting by focusing on food preparation, presentation and
consumption. These expectations are then evaluated using ceramic, ground stone, obsidian and
faunal data from the Cuauhtémoc site in the Soconusco region of Mexico. It is argued that elite
feasting events at Cuauhtémoc were used to create political cohesion as a new polity emerged

Shasta ground sloths (Nothrotheriops shastensis) are a conspicuous component of
Rancholabrean faunas of the Southwest. However, there are no archaeological sites where these
sloths have been documented to have been killed or butchered. As part of a museum-based
study of material collected at Gypsum Cave in 1930, we have identified multiple examples of
Shasta ground sloth bones that apparently record the activities of contemporary humans. Most
conspicuous are two sloth metatarsals with distinct cut marks. These cut marks are exactly where
an inexperienced butcher might cut to obtain a sloth claw and adjacent phalanges for a hunting
trophy or talisman.

largely unexplored. Although the use of watercraft during this time period is widely recognized

Paleoindian studies have tended to focus on traditionally male activities such as hunting and

Plains and Alaskan women, suggesting that women that may have performed the bulk of this
activity. Initial cross-cultural comparisons suggest that women tend to do the bulk of the hide
working in societies that target large game. These observations, coupled with a behavioral
ecological framework, suggest that generalizations regarding Paleoindian sexual division of labor
in hide working may be possible.

Ideology
The Dorset culture (c. 2500-1000/500 B.P.) represents one of the most enigmatic populations to

in North America 4500 years ago, Dorset developed unique artistic and architectural traditions
typically thought to have a primarily social and/or ideological significance. However, equally
intriguing is the apparent abandonment of key ancestral technologies (including the bow and
arrow) that strongly imply conscious social decisions. Using a structural approach composed of
universal visual oppositions, we develop a hypothesis about both the origin and potential meaning
of the unique attributes of Dorset material culture.

Thus I expect less clay sources with only good quality to be used in later ceramics.

[10] From Excavation to Reconstruction: Interpreting a Reconstructed Prehistoric Village for the
Modern Public
SunWatch Indian Village/Archaeological Park in Dayton, Ohio is an in situ partial reconstruction of
a Native American village dating to the Fort Ancient period. The reconstruction includes five lathe
and daub structures with grass thatch roofs, portions of a stockade and a native garden and
prairie with plants typical of the period. Inferred astronomical alignments originate from a complex
of posts at the center of the village. The interpretive development of the site is due in large part to
cooperation between amateur and professional archaeologists, as well as the local communities
and the city of Dayton.

[145] Paleoethnobotany at Chavin de Huantar, Peru
The highland Peruvian site of Chavin de Huantar (ca. 3000-2500 BP) has long been considered
the marker of the Early Horizon in the Andes. The iconography of Chavin is rich in phyto-imagery;
this evidence led early researchers (Coe 1962; Katz 1972; Lathrap 1973) to postulate that the site
may have occupied a crucial role in the early dispersal/ceremonial use of maize, hallucinogens,
and other lowland plants. Multiple lines of evidence (macro-botanical, phytolith, and starch grain
analysis) are being brought to bear on these issues and should help resolve contested viewpoints
about the nature of the site.

[124] Earthworks in Jefferson County, New York: The Evidence Mounts
In 2003, the use of a holistic archaeological approach led to the rediscovery of one of Ephraim
Squier‘s earthworks, recorded in 1849, on what is now Ft. Drum, New York. This paper attempts
to incite a renewed interest in re-locating other earthworks in the Jefferson County area. Newly
discovered historical documents, aerial photos, and an evaluation of previous archaeological
survey methods are examined. The reliability of oral accounts is also assessed. In addition,
special attention is given to the use of ground penetrating radar and resistivity surveying as
methods to assist in defining the perimeters of the site where the earthwork is no longer visible on

particular Eastern Pueblo linguistic regional relationships are suggested on the basis of the
geographic distribution of specific icons. In addition, Eastern Pueblo iconography in the Hopi
murals and Sikyatki mural paintings at Pottery Mound are indicative of the dynamic cultural
exchanges characteristic of Pueblo IV.

[156] The Tropical Chiefdom: Water Management, Fish Farming, and the Development of Social
Complexity on Marajó Island
Marajó Island is known by its harsh climate, characterized by periods of continuous rains and
extended floods, followed by extremely dry months, with damaging effects on soils and
vegetation. Even though, aboriginal populations managed this particular environment in order to
enhance their subsistence, by damming the rivers, constructing fishponds, and building elevated
villages. The mound builders of Marajó Island were organized in small hierarchical chiefdoms,
ruled by kinship groups who controlled the economy and ceremonial life. In investigating the
Camutins chiefdom, the author offers an ecological-economic model to explain the emergence of
social complexity on the Island.

[97] Placing Communities in Time: Exploring the Chronology of 13th Century Cibola Settlements
Temporal variation in settlement practices is a basic indicator of differences in community
structure and identity. Individuals and groups have diverse expectations of their own period of
residence and overall community permanence. Their goals color how communities are
constructed, maintained, and renewed. To explore how these expectations shape community
structure and identity, I compare temporal patterns in a number of Cibola communities occupied
in the 13th century AD. This investigation focuses on key dimensions of variation, including the
fluidity of the social landscape, the creation and use of socially important places, and the
temporal depth of community histories.

[67] Archaeological Evidence of Shamanic Practice and Culture Change among the Cahuilla of
the Coachella Valley, California
The shaman held a critical role in Cahuilla society through his powers to control weather, natural
resources, and disease. Both revered and feared, his elite status was achieved through public
ritual demonstrations of power, curing or causing sickness, and other manifestations critical to
economic, socio-political, and religious affairs. Primary archaeological contexts in the Coachella
Valley, including shamanic caches and mortuary features, represent rare and poignant
illustrations of cultural continuity and disruption of shamanic traditions. They reflect the shaman's
inherently tenuous position during the tumultuous period of mid-19th century epidemics and Euro-
american cultural intrusion.

The development of settled communities on the Colorado Plateau occurs within a larger context
of considerable demographic change. Populations engaged in numerous colonization efforts,
settled some regions at densities approaching the peak that would be seen prehistorically,
aggregated in villages nearly as large as any ever built locally, and participated in both regional
and local abandonment episodes. This overview explores the demographic underpinnings of this
profound transition, and outlines what may have been the demographic experiences of the
populations involved: high rates of internal growth and in- and out-migration, and extreme flux in
population size, structure, and permanence.

[104] Standardization in Pottery: An Ethnoarchaeological and Archaeological Comparison
Standardization has been used as an indicator of specialization of ceramic production in
archaeological contexts, but its validity as an indicator of specialized production continues to be
debated in ethnographic contexts. In addition, most ethnographic studies address specialization
and standardization in complex, state-level or market based societies. Although examined by
some, the role of standardization in less complex, middle-range societies has rarely been a focus
of study. In this research, I examine this problem by comparing morphological standardization of
ceramics from cross-cultural ethnographic groups to southwestern US and state level
archaeological groups.

During 2004, PVC staff mapped clays around Las Canoas, located in the lower Chamelecon
drainage. Using these, we worked with a contemporary potter to record clay recipes, processing
methods, vessel shaping, and firing practices. We then systematically developed clay recipes,
shaped vessels, and experimented with firing. We learned that ancient potters likely mixed clays
in the Classic period, but relied on relatively unprocessed materials in the Postclassic. While no
firing facilities were found at Las Canoas, experiments suggest that they would have been
required for thin-walled Classic period vessels, while open-pit firing could have served for
Postclassic pots.

[56] The Faunal Assemblage from McEuen Cave, Southeastern Arizona
Archaeological testing at McEuen Cave, a dry residential rockshelter in southeastern Arizona,
yielded 23 annuals dating between 3491 and 4360 radiocarbon years (RCY) B.P., a time during
the Late Middle Archaic period in the southern Southwest. These excavations produced a large
collection of faunal remains, and analyses and results are presented. The assemblage is
dominated by cottontails and jackrabbits (60%) and artiodactyls (20%), with fewer rodents, fish,
birds, reptiles, and carnivores. The presence of various taxa in the assemblage suggests that the
inhabitants of the rockshelter used a broad spectrum of resources from woodland, riparian, and
desert grassland habitats.

[88] Early Holocene Occupation of the Old River Bed Delta, Western Utah
During the last regressive phase of Pleistocene Lake Bonneville, a major river connected lakes in
the Sevier and Salt Lake basins and formed an extensive delta. As lake levels continued to drop,
this delta pro-graded and developed into a vast wetland. After -11,000 14C years BP,
Paleoarchaic foragers began to occupy this ecosystem and continued to do so until 8700 BP.
Nearly 100 of an estimated 500 Paleoarchaic sites have been recorded in the delta. Most are
linear artifact scatters along inverted sand and gravel channels that provided elevated camp sites
and access routes, while others consists of diffuse scatters on the adjacent mudflats. Numerous
forms of Great Basin Stemmed points occur, but the principal tools apparently were simple basalt
flakes struck from large bifaces. Movement within this large wetland may have been frequent, but
reworking of tools and limited toolstone diversity suggests moves away from the delta were less
frequent than elsewhere during the Great Basin Paleoarchaic.

tools were replicated and used for agave processing: preparing agave heads for pit roasting,
pounding and scraping cooked agave to dry for storage, and making fiber for cordage. The
replicated tools worked extremely well; use-wear patterns closely matched archaeological tools.
Quartzite cobbles, readily available in most drainages, were likely used for casual tools for most
of the prehistoric past and up to the contact period.

in all stages of research combines ecological understandings of desert grassland ecosystem

elements, quantity of crushed bone fragments, and season of occupation over the course of
several hundred years to examine form and variation in hunting and processing strategies.

ethnographic and archaeological evidence, clear normative associations between tasks and
gender are difficult to identify for Mimbres peoples. The material correlates for one male task and
one female task are represented in the site assemblage. While limited, the results suggest that
this approach can yield insight into group composition and organization at sites of limited
occupational duration.

In the midcontinental United States, analyses of ceramic assemblages from prehistoric contexts

[91] Intensification of Ancestor Veneration: An Alternative Explanation for Classic to Postclassic
Changes in Petén Maya Domestic Architecture
The problem of interpreting the Classic to Postclassic (A.D. 700-1200) transformation of domestic
architecture in Central Petén, Guatemala has led several researchers to hypothesize that Maya
or foreign immigrants brought new house designs with them, specifically C-shaped masonry
bench forms and central altars. However, based upon recent excavations, I suggest that in the
Quexil-Petenxil Basins, local Maya populations maintained continuity. Architectural change in
house design relates more closely to changing family organization and changes in bench-altars
are interpreted as intensified displays of ancestor veneration. These changes are an active
negotiation of local, rural communities to political change brought about by the Maya collapse.

[124] Nanticoke Indian Burial Practices: Challenges for Archaeological Interpretation
This paper compiles firsthand accounts of human burial practices of the Nanticoke Indians and
identifies implications of these traditions for archaeological interpretation and NAGPRA
repatriation. The Nanticokes, first encountered by Europeans on the Eastern Shore of
Chesapeake Bay, were known for disinterring primary inhumations in order to clean bones and
reinter them in local ossuaries or in secondary burials at new settlements. Assembled
descriptions of mortuary customs include original translations of eighteenth-century German
diaries of Moravian missionaries. Consideration of the reported burial behavior of the migrating
Nanticokes indicates several challenges in associating specific interments with specific cultural
groups.

[164] A CAOS in Points: The Agony and the Ecstasy of Projectile Point Typology
Projectile point typology is a standard tool used in the analysis and interpretation of
archaeological sites and regional archaeological patterns. Conventional typological approaches
are based on the presence of discrete morphological variation among types. Recent research has
suggested that morphological variation is continuous among types. This has important
implications for the construction of regional chronologies based on projectile point typology.
Analysis of projectile points from Modoc Rockshelter employing computer-assisted optical
stereology shows that trends in projectile point morphological variation are not strongly correlated
with temporal affiliations. This creates an almost insurmountable challenge to the application of
conventional projectile point typology.

[32] Exploring the Meanings of Human Movement in the Ancient Costa Rican Landscape
The Proyecto Prehistorico Arenal integrates remote sensing with archaeology and geology to
document phases of ancient footpaths in northwestern Costa Rica. Beginning 500BC people
separated cemeteries from villages and walked single file in straight lines between them.
Generations of ideologically-structured movement had the unanticipated effect of entrenching the
paths. This became the proper/ideal way to enter a special place, as generations constructed
meaning and social memory. Archaeological and geological evidence of path routes and
endpoints are presented. Later complex societies needed monumentality, and built massive
entrenched entryways. The later meaning of construction is revealed in the earlier construction of
meaning.

[55] Early Neolithic Communities in North China: Site Structure in Comparative Perspective
Analysis of site structure 'variability of architectural features, their location vis-à-vis each other,

has figured prominently in analysis of Neolithic societies but most studies have focused on a few
well-known examples and have not taken advantage of advanced techniques of spatial analysis.
Rigorous analysis of recently excavated sites from north China produces a much more
heterogeneous picture of early Neolithic communities. Comparison with known examples from
China and elsewhere is used to develop the theoretical foundation for reconstruction of early
Neolithic communities.

The sixteenth century has traditionally been treated as a break in what is actually a continuum of

settlements. Extensive research in colonial archives demonstrates that the inhabitants of colonial
towns in the Ulua Valley continued to negotiate their place in society independently of other
towns. Engagement with other regions through inter-town marriage, Caribbean trade, and military
mobilization (initially to resist Spanish and later pirate intrusions), and continued cultivation of
cacao, the mainstay of the precolombian economy, are documented for towns throughout the

Why is it so difficult to identify ethnic differences in the archaeological record of the Andean
highlands when the presence of the Inka state seems relatively easy to identify? Perhaps the
ethnic identity of groups like the Canas was a function of kinship and allegiance to their kuraka
that was not expressed through their quotidian house and pottery traditions (which are similar to
those of their neighbors). In contrast the rapid development of a range of 'Inka' style pottery and
architecture drew upon distinctive styles previously existing in the Cuzco region and helped to
forge a new shared identity through colorful rituals that emphasized developing social hierarchies
within the 'Inkas of privilege.'

South American archaeology is becoming a crucial player in the debate of the initial colonization

ideas and questions about the subsistence economy of Terminal Pleistocene/Early Holocene
foraging societies of the neotropics. Micro-economic models derived from evolutionary ecology,
together with indirect empirical evidence based on archaeological studies in the Amazon and in

Holocene foragers was organized around plant collecting. In the present paper we test these
models with evidence from archaeobotanical remains from Central Brazil.

Neolithic at least a thousand years earlier than previously thought. This has particular implications
for early domestication and for the social complexity required for an open-seas colonization
strategy. This paper examines this issue from the perspective of Ais Yiorkis, one of the new sites
contributing to our reorientation of how remote, previously unoccupied, areas were colonized.

of misunderstanding, which can be traced to factors including different perceptions of the role of
analogy in archaeological inference, variation in the units of analysis utilized, and the increasing
insular nature of regional and topical specialties.

Mid-Holocene Elk Head Site, Big Horn Basin, Wyoming
Researchers have categorized forager adaptive strategies as either time-minimizers with an
immediate-return system or energy-maximizers with a delayed-return system. Time minimizers
share resources, treat resources as public goods, lack long-term storage, exploit foods with low
handling costs, and are residentially mobile. Archaeological clues indicating time-minimizers
include evidence for sharing such as refitting of artifacts, the close spacing of dwellings, the
absence of storage facilities, and the low density and diversity of recovered remains. The
analyses of the remains of three contemporaneous, closely spaced huts at the Elk Head site
reveal that they shared resources and appear to have been time-minimizers.

[93] Determining the Sexes of Pictographic Handprints
Pictographic handprints are a worldwide human phenomenon. Archaeologists have often
assumed that they were made primarily (if not exclusively) by men and boys. However, human
hands are sexually dimorphic, and because of this it is possible to determine the probable
genders of individuals who left handprints in the archaeological record. Key measures include
overall hand length and certain ratios of digit length. I started with a reference database of
scanned handprints from an America population of European descent. Mean measurements from
that population were used to determine the genders of handprints in European caves. This is
possible because recent research has shown that the European population has been genetically
stable since the Upper Paleolithic. Preliminary findings from four French caves indicates that both
men and women were present. Visitors to the poster presentation will be able to compare their
own handprints to examples from the caves and to compute their own probabilities.

[69] Characterizing Conflict: Defensive Sites and Strategies in East-central Arizona
This poster documents the defining characteristics, chronology, and occupation histories of a
unique set of defensively-oriented sites in prehistoric east-central Arizona. Recent survey,
mapping, and excavation data indicate that occupation of these sites entailed significant social
changes and major alterations in landscape use, with lasting effects on local populations.
Examination of sites and settlement patterns reveal the defensive strategies adopted by the site‘s
occupants, serving as important clues to the nature of the perceived threat. Settlement pattern
and artifact data from adjacent regions suggest that the defensive response was both widespread
and accompanied by a significant amount of inter-regional trade.

[134] The Lost Maya are Only a Shovel Test Away
Some ancient Maya sites are invisible in the modern landscape due to environmental change. In
other cases there is extensive settlement without mounded remains. Shovel-testing along
transects has successfully discovered these types of hidden sites on the southern coast and
offshore cays of Belize. We discuss the discovery of sites in forested areas. underwater, and in
mangrove swarms at Wild Cane Cay, Frenchman's Cay, Arvin's Landing, Tiger Mound, Pelican
Cay, and the newly discovered underwater sites in Paynes Creek National Park. Compelling
evidence from our research indicates that current assessments seriously under represent Maya
population estimates and settlement patterns.

[104] A New Method for Dating Cohonina Sites Based on Ceramic Thickness
Recent investigations into attribute variability within assemblages of Cohonina pottery from sites
in north-central Arizona support the viability of a new dating technique. Measures of mean sherd
thickness for these assemblages appear strongly correlated with tree-ring cutting dates produced
from the various sites. A simple regression formula serves as the basis for the new model, which
offers an easy method for dating the numerous Cohonina sites that exhibit indigenous pottery, but
lack more precisely dated decorated trade types. The author asserts that employment of the new
procedure will result in vastly more synchronic views of Cohonina prehistory.

[142] Military Forts and their Architectural and Archaeological Landscapes
Military forts are dynamic facilities that are in constant change. Historical records important in
understanding archaeological and architectural features on these sites. Due to changes that have
occurred at an installation, documentation and the use of archaeology as a tool of interpretation
must include a proper understanding of military documents. Existing maps of Fort Douglas, Utah,
dating from 1862 to the present, provide a good example of this interpretation. On different copies
of fort maps, some specifically identified buildings appear in different locations or not at all.
Further, some appear on maps, but not in the archaeological record. This paper discusses how
archaeological investigation was used at Fort Douglas to identify and correct the information
gathered from documents.

[25] An Examination of the Potential of Portable-XRF in Archaeology
X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) is one of the most widely used and versatile of all
instrumental analytical techniques. Archaeologists routinely use XRF to characterize pottery,
obsidian, metal, and other inorganic materials. Technological advances in XRF instrumentation
during the last several years, such as the development of high-precision thermoelectrically-cooled
detectors and miniature X-ray tubes have facilitated the development of portable-XRF
instruments that provide rapid, low-cost, multi-elemental characterization of archaeological
materials. A major advantage of PXRF is that the instrument easily can be transported into the
field or to museums, permitting multi-element chemical characterization of archaeological
materials in nontraditional laboratory environments.

Ancient DNA analysis was applied to approximately 60 salmon remains (1200BP) from the
archaeological site of Keatley Creek in British Columbia to examine the distribution of pacific
salmon species between housepits. The success rate of DNA extraction was over 90%, yielding
three species of pacific salmon: Chinook, Sockeye and Coho. Accurate salmon species

In this paper I apply Sewall Wright's model of adaptive landscapes to the process of primary state

evolutionary transformation must traverse a valley of relatively low fitness as it moves from one
adaptive peak to the next. This expectation is evaluated with archaeological data pertaining to the
rise of the Monte Alban state ca. 300, B. C. in Mexico's Oaxaca Valley.

[161] Herding and Rustling: Variability in Access to Spanish Domestic Stock among the Salinas
Pueblos
The Salinas pueblos of central New Mexico were established in a diversity of environments, from
more mountainous to more Plains-like, developed different intensities of trading relations with
Plains hunter-gatherers, and experienced different histories of occupation over the period from
A.D. 1300-1672. Following upon Spanish colonization in the early 1600s, some pueblos were
missionized, while others remained visitas, with no Spaniards in residence. In this paper we
explore the ways in which pre-colonial hunting strategies and trading relations, and post-colonial
missionary presence affected the choices that residents of different Salinas villages made
concerning consumption of Spanish domestic animals.

including water control, wind protection, microclimate selection, and use of volcanic cinders as
mulch. With only 15 cm of annual precipitation and without irrigation, water was likely the most
important constraint on agricultural success. Soil fertility analyses suggest plant productivity was
adversely affected by low nitrogen levels and high pH, which limits phosphorus availability.
Without the use of fertilizers, these soils might have become unsuitable for crop production
relatively quickly. Regardless of these impediments, pollen analysis at nearby fields demonstrates
cultivation of corn and other crops by prehistoric people.

[136] Settlement Permanency and Trends Toward Greater Complexity on the North Coast of Peru
Recent research on the north coast of Peru identified several sites with multiple Early and Middle

terms of their relevance for understanding trends toward village settlement patterns and group
development. Much like other parts of the world, settlement permanency, technological change,
and increased economic intensification in the Central Andes preceded agriculture and thus signal
important trends in the development of later complex societies. Less obvious is the articulation of
place and identity in the development of territoriality and the roles that each played in regional
long-term socio-economic change.

[47] The (Archaeological) Joy of Cooking: Food Preparation, Social Context, and Ethnicity in a
Prehistoric Mesopotamian Colony
Differences between food preparation and consumption can reflect contrasts between domestic
and more public social spheres. These activities highlight different context-dependent assertions
of identity and practice. This paper examines food preparation at the site of Hac'nebi (Turkey),
where, in 3700 BC, an Uruk Mesopotamian colony was established inside this local Anatolian
settlement. I compare several aspects of food preparation with the social context of consumption.
The evidence is consistent with gendered ethnic differences between these contexts, suggesting
that colonists at Hac'nebi forged marriage alliances with local elites to form multi-cultural
households of Uruk males and Anatolian females.

[80] The Economics of Social Complexity: Centralization and Taxation as a Means of Offsetting
Environmental Unpredictability in Ancient Egypt
The Egyptian Archaic period (ca 3100–2600 BCE) is characterized by the onset of unpredictable
Nile flood volumes (a proxy indicator of environmental abundance), such as had not been
experienced for the previous four millennia. The Archaic period coincides with the development of
increasingly elaborate mortuary and ceremonial traditions, coincident with developed centralized
storage and the earliest documented incidences of taxation. It is argued that taxation and
potential employment in the mortuary and ceremonial "industries" served to offset the
environmental unpredictability introduced by fluctuating Nile flood events and, as a by-product,
facilitated an increase in monumental constructions.

continuum from the near egalitarian to the chiefdom. Specialists may monopolize many crafts and
professions or practice only the core crafts: iron metallurgy and potting. This package has some
potential to be archaeologically visible. However, it is reconstruction of specialization rather than
caste that is of significance for the understanding of social dynamics and evolution.

suggests that similar beliefs were present prehistorically as well. Study of the incidence,
placement, and type of lithics placed with the dead indicates that many may have served as
symbolic weapons. These "weapons" were interred with men, women, and children.

[100] Stones Under Scrutiny: Problematizing Aegean Ground Stone Tools
Unlike pottery or chipped stone tools, ground stone tools have never been a popular object of
study among Aegean prehistorians. When they attract scholarly attention, ground stone tools are
usually approached in a superficial, descriptive manner and with the implicit assumption that they
represent straightforward pieces of evidence that do not require further scrutiny. In this paper I
will attempt to present a more complex picture of this neglected material on the basis of detailed
study of a number of Neolithic assemblages.

[145] Pollen Analysis of a Mesoamerican Wetland Agricultural System: Implications for Pre-
Hispanic Sociopolitical Development
The use of wetlands for agricultural production was common to various areas of pre-Hispanic
Mesoamerica, but the sophistication of these cultivation systems and their productive capabilities
varied widely. Systematic investigation of planting platform and canal features confirms the
existence of an elaborate pre-Hispanic wetland agricultural system in the Tequila Valleys of
Jalisco, Mexico. In this paper, I discuss how pollen analysis confirms the agricultural origin of
these features, allows documentation of their age, and facilitates discussion of water
management. Implications of these derived data concerning resource use, tribute, productive
potential, agricultural intensification, and sociopolitical development are then briefly explored.

[157] Climatic Fluctuation and its Impact on Human Settlement: A Lacustrine Site (550-900 DC) in
the Upper Lerma Marsh, Toluca
Recent palaeoenvironmental researches carried out in the Chignahuapan Marsh, in the Upper
Lerma Basin, Central Mexico, revealed that at around 550-650 DC, a drier climate prevailed.
Coincident with this climatic condition, archaeological evidences suggest the constructions of
more than a 100 mounds, through radical modification of lacustrine landscape. The apogee of the
construction took place during the Epiclassic period, when a lacustrine society flourished. Then,
at around 900 DC, coincident with another climatic fluctuation recorded at the beginning of the
Postclassic period, the inhabitants abandoned this mode of life, sustained by delicate interaction
and balance with its surrounding lacustrine environment.

[95] Cahokia and Oneota Iconographies: A Link to the Ideologies and Social Organizations of the
Southeast Ceremonial Complex
Contemporaneous Oneota and Cahokia populations shared some aspects of ceramic
iconography on Oneota jars and Ramey-Incised Cahokian ceramics, but differed significantly in
others. The distinct use of central and adjacent motifs and their relation to ideological ties relies
heavily on the differences in the degree of socio-political hierarchy in the two regions. By further
examining the use of these iconographic similarities in a broader scale, a closer interpretation of
ideologies based on iconographies and a better understanding of design layout can be gathered.

[135] Vessels unto Sherds into Data: The Inferential Challenges of Working with Residual
Archaeological Assemblages
Ethnoarchaeological studies have profitably investigated how different abandonment modes
affect ceramic assemblage formation at various anthropological levels of analysis, such as
household or village. The archaeological study of abandonment, however, illustrates the centrality
of constructing appropriate units of analysis for investigating the origins of sherd assemblages.
With three sites from the Grand Canyon area, each abandoned under different circumstances, I
show how, depending on which recovery contexts are examined, dramatically different
conclusions regarding the causes of ceramic assemblage variation can be developed. In a
strange twist, these archaeological "cautionary tales" have implications for expanding the
research agendas of ceramic ethnoarchaeologists.

[161] The Fauna from Paa'ko: Continuity and Innovation in Early Colonial Puebloan Foodways
Colonizers entering the ethnically diverse Rio Grande Valley included Europeans; mestizos and
central Mexican Indians, the latter strongly influencing colonial cuisine. Paa-ko (LA-162), a pre-
Pueblo Revolt site on the eastern slopes of the Sandia Mountains, is a reoccupation of an earlier,
abandoned pueblo. It displays innovative metallurgical technology, new uses of precolonial
architectural settings, and remains of native and introduced animals. A central research question
is thus its inhabitants' ethnic affiliation(s). Animal use patterns suggest that Paa-ko represents
indigenous adaptation to new colonial circumstances, within an enduring Puebloan framework.
This includes continued Puebloan ritual practices, despite evidence for missionization.

[18] Adaptive Strategies or Ideological Innovations? Interpreting Sociopolitical Developments in
the Jequetepeque Valley of Peru during The Late Moche Period
Environmental perturbations are thought to have led to the reconstitution of traditional belief
systems and hierarchical political relations on Peru‘s North Coast during the Late Moche Period.
Ideological transformations are thus interpreted as reactive, adaptive responses to social and
ecological disruptions. Nevertheless, religious practices directly shaped the formation of
alternative power structures in prehistoric Peru. This is evident in Late Moche Jequetepeque,
which witnessed the proliferation of non-elite ceremonial sites that structured distinctive new
forms of political organization. The Jequetepeque case study is mobilized to critique normative
interpretations of the role of religious ideology in cultural adaptation and sociopolitical
realignment.

The paradox of archaeology is that one must destroy what one discovers. However, through the
use of GIS technology, this problem can be largely ameliorated. With a digital camera and the
appropriate software, it is possible to create a virtual record of an excavation, which not only
facilitates in the speed and accuracy of mapping encountered features, but also allows the
investigator to go back to and study previous levels of excavation. This presentation aims to
demonstrate how the application of GIS methodologies aided in the excavation of a 5 meter by 5
meter unit at the Preceramic site of Caballete in the Fortaleza Valley, Peru.

[4] Identification of Flaking Techniques Through the Analysis of Lithic Crack Velocity
To achieve the identification of flaking techniques (knapping materials: metal, stone, antler and
wood, and knapping techniques: pressure, indirect percussion and direct percussion), we focus
on fracture wings, which are microscopic markings found on the fracture surfaces of a wide range
of brittle solids including obsidian. Fracture wings are very reliable registers of lithic crack velocity.
Our several experiments demonstrate that a strong association between crack velocity and
flacking techniques does in fact exist. We attempt to undertake the identification of flaking
techniques in the selected artifact classes from paleolithic assemblages of Northern Japan.

[85] Linguistic Indicators of Social Status: Designations for Endogamous Specialists in Savannah
West
Many societies of sub-Saharan Africa are characterized by ritually and professionally specialized,
hierarchically ranked endogamous groups (specifically artisans and musicians, in the case of
West Africa]. Linguistic correlates of this social status include: designations whose etymologies,
in and of themselves, suggest extra-ordinary ritual powers or behavior patterns; a double series
of designations for the practitioners of certain activities, only one of which refers to their technical
aspects; simultaneous presence of words that refer to two or more groups, and ones that
designate individual professions. However, linguistic evidence is not always a sufficient basis for
inferring endogamous status.

[42] Ancient Mesoamerican Rubber Processing and Use: Balls, Sandals, and Tool Hafting
Ancient Mesoamericans were processing rubber by 1600 BC to make items such as sandal
soles, bands to haft tools to handles, and balls for the Mesoamerican ballgame. The processing
regimes developed enabled Mesoamericans to tailor various mechanical properties of rubber to
suit the requirements of specific applications. Rubber balls could have elasticity maximized,
sandal soles could be selectively processed to resist wear, hafting bands equipped to absorb
shock. Studying the range of rubber properties available can provide insight into ancient rubber
use, such as the performance of the ball in the ballgame and the physical realities of playing the
game.

[54] American Gladiators: Ritual Boxing among The Classic Maya
In Classic Maya studies, a great deal of attention has been paid to the preColumbian ball game.
However, the ball game certainly was not the only competitive sport performed by the ancient
Maya. Yet another important form of sport was ritual boxing, with the players frequently wearing
heavy masks and other protective gear. In these events, the performers often wielded a variety of
weapons, including conch shells, stone spheres wrapped in cloth, manoplas and the so-called
padlock stones. Although a form of blood sport, Classic Maya boxing thematically overlapped with
the ritual ball game. As with the ball game, boxing also related to rain and agricultural fertility.
Although this study will focus upon Classic Maya writing and art, the boxing complex will be
discussed in the broader context of ancient Mesoamerica, including the Formative Olmec and
ancient Oaxaca.

[4] Naive Foragers: Modeling Resource Exploitation in Newly Colonized Landscapes
Traditional foraging theory models assume foragers possess perfect knowledge of the
environment as a basis for predicting optimality in resource exploitation. This assumption may be
inappropriate for situations in which foragers colonize radically different environments, as
occurred when tropical Polynesians migrated to temperate New Zealand. Here we develop a
model incorporating principles of evolutionary ecology to predict forager behavior in novel
settings. We test this model using archaeological data from island contexts and assess how
effectively it predicts the subsistence behavior of human colonizers. We conclude by considering
the ways in which the model augments foraging theory applications to archaeology.

The Columbia Plateau region of North America has long been ethnographically known as an area
where access to the supernatural is very egalitarian. To date the ethnography relating to women's

has not been summarized. The authors surveyed Columbia Plateau ethnography and oral
tradition to document women's participation in these cultural institutions and to find instances
where women were known to have produced rock art. The results support a basically egalitarian
system, albeit with differences noted for various cultural groups within the region.

Curation costs continue to rise and this impacts policy concerning long-term collections curation
by repositories. But what about the collections that haven‘t entered the 'system' yet, usually in
infested cardboard boxes, perhaps uncataloged, and with scant field information? Too often
archaeologists do not consider the long-term impact of the collections they create on repositories

value. Based on firsthand situations, this paper looks at what can be done to ensure that once

Excavations on Sanak Island, Alaska, revealed micro-geographical differences in fauna. The
faunal assemblages are dominated by birds, which is different from what has been seen on the
western Alaska Peninsula. Because of its geographical location, it comes as no surprise that
marine mammals comprise 99 % of the mammalian remains and probably dominated
subsistence. However, it is surprising that terrestrial mammals, which are not found on the island,
make up the other one percent. The island has several salmon runs which were exploited by the
ancient Aleuts, but cod and halibut were also taken in large numbers. Littorines and other rocky
intertidal shellfish dominate the midden remains and served as a resource buffer in the diet of
ancient Aleut living on the island.

at Vale de Obidos, Portugal
Diverse activities employing Upper Paleolithic thermal technology are manifest across the large

boiling are located near large stone-lined hearth features. An analytical technique using magnetic
susceptibility provides insight into wind direction during site occupation. Pinus and Erica branches
were burned in a pit structure, possibly for smudging. Tool residue studies and spatial analysis
indicate that hematite was used during hide scraping and processing. Much of the hematite at
Vale de Obidos was produced by thermal alteration of local goethite-rich sandstones. Studies of
Upper Paleolithic technological organization, traditionally focused on lithic and organic tool
technologies, should recognize the knowledge and skill evident within these complex thermal
technologies.

The most insidious ideologies are those that entwine themselves around what are commonly held

are often connected with the realization of human potential and the overthrow of repression, but
they are also implicitly opposed to community, tradition and altruism. Archaeologists often
approve accounts of the past in which humanity is emphasized, and this is well and good. But the
potential pitfall of 'touchy-feely' humanism is that it smuggles in the free-market, unfettered-
competition values of neo-liberalism.

[38] Solemn Treaties Both Sides Had Sworn: Rethinking the Barbarian vs. Civilization
Archaeologists worldwide are currently reframing core-periphery, world-system, and
dependency/interaction concepts, i.e., the Olmec phenomenon has been reconstituted as highly
varied and overlaid differently on various societies, and the Iron Age Celts, once considered
peripheral and highly influenced by Mediterranean contact, are now deemed dynamically
interacting and mutually influential with the "core." Despite such reinterpretations, Iron Age
Scandinavia is habitually labeled a fringe region transformed primarily via Eurasian interactions.
Rejecting traditional culture-historic concepts, I argue that internal class and factional conflicts
catalyzed social change: interaction was only one of many legitimization tools, and influence
traveled both to and from the ―core‖.

osteoarchaeological, ethnohistorical and iconographic information, leading to a broader

[86] Manifestations of Identity: Feminist Guided Household Archaeology at the Site of Dos
Hombres,Belize
Feminist archaeology approaches provide unique opportunities to look at the archaeological
record from diverse perspectives. As a principle in archaeological practice, it clearly directs what
we ask in initiating our research. Subsequently we find ourselves challenged to discern social
meaning from traditional archaeological data. This paper presents household research oriented
toward questions of gender identities and the socialization of specific ideologies that was
performed in the settlement area of Dos Hombres, Belize. The result is one perception of
materialized identity expression in the daily lives of these ancient Maya.

[137] Rock Art Depictions of Ancient Religious Concepts in Asia and North America
The oldest rock art in North America may be linked to Asian rock art by shared themes that derive
from ancient beliefs. Because religious concepts can have great stability and longevity, we may
be able to link concepts in ethnographies and oral histories to depictions in ancient rock art. One
such theme is the emergence of animals from the underworld to populate the earth, depicted
either by oblique or vertical placement of animals on the rock face or animals positioned as if
emerging from bedrock cracks. Selection of animals depicted appears to reflect religious
concepts rather than economic concerns.

[48] Sourcing Casas Grandes Polychrome Ceramics
Traditionally the wide distribution of the distinctive Casas Grandes Polychrome ceramics has
been interpreted as evidence for the wide interaction sphere of Paquime. The role of the major
center of Paquime in the political and economic system is a crucial question in defining the nature
and intensity of interactions in the Casas Grandes region and the extent of intra-regional social

[6] Cultural Identity and Mestizaje in Seventeenth-Century New Mexico
The Spanish colonists entering New Mexico In 1598 and 1601 came from diverse cultural
backgrounds. Various cultural practices encouraged the incorporation of Plains and Pueblo
women into colonial households. The gender ratio of colonists and their attitudes towards sexual
relations with indigenous women led to mestizaje. Modeling rates of incorporating indigenous
women into the Spanish community has important Implications for relations between native
peoples and colonists and among colonists because bloodline was an important way that
colonists judged each other. Rates of indigenous women in colonial households have implications
for the changing cultural practices of individuals identifying themselves as Spanish.

[31] The Creation of Place during the Neolithic of Central Serbia
The Middle to Late Neolithic of Central Serbia (c. 5300-4200 B.C.) is a period when significant
changes occurred in the way that people lived. During this period, there is evidence for increased
sedentism, the permanence of architectural features, the elaboration of material culture, and the
acquisition and production of new types of prestige items. This evidence is indicative of important
changes in the significance of place. Through the use of a combined practice theory and
phenomenological approach, this paper explores the evidence for the creation of new kinds of
places during the Middle to Late Neolithic in Central Serbia.

[145] Dietary Diversity and Status in Mesoamerica
The murky relationship between diet status is most difficult to model in regions like Mesoamerica
where the dietary focus is on a few staple foods (maize, beans, and squash). On one hand, those
with economic and social means can reduce the monotony of their diet by including a diverse
variety of foods and flavorings. Alternatively, based on ethnographic research, a diversified diet
can be explained as a response to inadequate supply of staple foods, so that non-elites have a
more diverse diet than elites: Paleoethnobotani data from diverse parts of Mesoamerica are used
to examine these contradictory models.

Human sacrifice is a common theme in Maya codices and murals from the Late Postclassic

Bound victims prior to sacrifice and mummy bundles of sacrificed individuals are also depicted.
We examine this imagery within its calendrical and ritual context. Much of it can be related to
period-ending ceremonies in the Maya calendar. Sacrifices of this nature form part of the contract
that bound humans and deities-the offering of blood in return for the essentials of life (maize and
rain), as the Santa Rita murals demonstrate especially clearly.

different segments of the populace. Because maize is the most abundant and ubiquitous plant

in its production, processing, and consumption.

[13] Late Postclassic Boundary Dynamics: Toztlan, Veracruz
Toztlan was situated at one of the most dynamic crossroads of Mesoamerica during the Late
Postclassic period where affluent cultures of the Gulf Lowlands, Isthmus of Tehuantepec and
Triple Alliance intersected geographically, culturally, and politically. This position placed Toztlan
at an ideal location for the study of boundary dynamics during one of the most active periods of
cross-regional movements and culture contacts in prehispanic Mesoamerica. I present the
findings of the first field season of archaeological study at Totogal, the site believed to have been
the Postclassic cabecera of Toztlan listed on the Tochtepec tribute page of the Codex Mendoza.

[44] Egypt from 50 to 25 ka BP: A Scarcely Inhabited Region?
During the OIS 5 - OIS 4, Egypt was intensely populated. Data concerning 50 to 25 ka BP is
restricted because a very arid climate. No known human presence in the Lower Egyptian. The
long blades Taramsan industry is dated 50-45 ka BP. A burial of an anatomic modern Homo
sapiens child is probably of the same age. Around 35 ka a new extraction technology with
southerly influences was introduced. The Shuwikhatian sites, around 25 ka, bear some
resemblance with Mediterranean assemblages. Egypt, in this period, seems to be looking more to
the South than to the Mediterranean.

[151] Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic Foragers of the Northern Rio Grande
Very little research has been conducted on Late Paleoindian and Early Archaic use of the
Northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico and Colorado. Previous discussions have questioned
the continuity between these periods, while others argue that the evidence would support the
contention that the shift to more generalized foragers began during the Late Paleoindian and not
the Early Archaic. Given the lack of subsistence data for these time periods, this paper will
provide a preliminary evaluation of possible transhumance patterns through lithic material,
technology and use studies of projectile points found throughout the Northern Rio Grande region.

[30] Santa Elina: A Pleistocene Rockshelter in Central Brazil
Santa Elina (Mato Grosso) is a large rock art shelter. Excavated until 4 meters deep, displays an
important chronostratigraphy of human occupation. It has three stratigraphic units. Unit I, with a
sequence from 6000 to 2000 yBP, Unit II including early Holocene and late Pleistocene remains,
and Unit III, which belongs to the Pleistocene. Santa Elina also shows the contemporaneity of
lithic artifacts and megafauna (Glossotherium)in two different strata, dated from 10,000 and
25,000 yBP respectively, thus pointing to important issues as regards the early peopling of South
America.

[144] Patterns in the Organization of Production at Early Copper Production Sites in Central
Thailand
Excavations by the Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project at a cluster of prehistoric sites in the ore-
rich Khao Wong Prachan Valley in central Thailand have revealed evidence for a major, regional
copper production center. Occupation at these sites: Non Mak La, Non Pa Wai, and Nil Kham
Haeng dates from the late third millennium BC to the mid-first millennium AD. These sites are
multi-component sites that have well provenienced assemblages associated with both habitation
activities and large scale pyrotechnic production. This paper discusses the dating of these sites
as well as patterns in the organization of production in the valley during prehistory.

[18] A New Perspective on an Old Issue: the Secularization of the Andean State
Decades ago, researchers speculated about the possible secularization of the Andean state in
the later periods of Peruvian prehistory. This issue has recently resurfaced due to new
investigations into the Casma polity. The Casma polity appears to have occupied nearly 300km of
the Peruvian north coast during the Middle Horizon (ca. AD600-1000), a time of cultural transition
and political instability. This period is important for understanding the development of the most
centralized states in the prehispanic Andes. Preliminary investigations at the Casma capital, the
site of El Purgatorio, provide new insights into the secularization thesis and Andean state
formation processes.

[114] Reconstituting the 'Colonial' in Culture Contact: The Archaeology of Military Architecture
during the Bourbon Reforms in Northwest New Spain
The culture contact framework emphasizes that culture change is inherently bi-directional,
transforming the cultures and lifeways of both colonized and colonizer. Yet too often the 'colonial'
population is presumptively framed as homogeneous and static in its cultural practices. Through a
study of frontier military architecture, this paper argues that the 'colonial' must be reconstituted.
The ethnic, racial, gendered, and cultural diversity of the colonial population challenges the neat
dichotomy between colonizer and colonized. The tensions within colonial culture - in this case,
between military regulations and vernacular practices - are traced as part of the web of
relationships that shape colonial/indigenous encounters.

[100] Mesolithic Settlement Around the North Sea Basin: A Case Study From Howick, Britain
Recent discoveries of substantial Mesolithic huts in coastal areas of North-East Britain has
revealed evidence for long-term occupation spanning several generations. Most of these sites
date to the beginning of the 8th millennium BC (Cal.) suggesting they are a temporally distinct
phenomenon. In searching to explain this pattern attention is drawn to the rapid sea-level rise at
this time. Displacement of populations inhabiting the North Sea Plain to surrounding areas may
have driven the need for more 'permanent' structures as surrounding groups strove to maintain
territorial control and access to resources. This paper explores this hypothesis with reference to
recently excavated sites.

The Greek kitchen was designed to be functional, multi-purpose and portable, from its stove
components to its pots and pans. The cooking ware materials from the southern Italian site of
Pantanello, a Greek-indigenous rural sanctuary, as well as from other sites in the Metapontino
region, exemplify the versatility of forms and temper choices made by the potters and emphasize
the conservative nature of dietary and cooking practices. The distinction of vessels meant to be
used over the fire, versus those used directly on the fire source provides information about formal
and thermal choices, as well as gender and social practices.

[8] Networks of Memory and Meaning: Creating a Nexus of Social Identity in Woodland Mounds
in Northeastern Florida
Mounds in the Southeastern United States have long been relegated to explanations of
evolutionary trajectories toward increasing "complexity," while structural transformations
facilitated through the construction and use of mounds remain largely ignored. Instead, I argue
that major changes in the structure and organization of monuments at regional scales, such as
the architectural transition from Late Archaic to Woodland monuments, intersected localized
representations that facilitated construction of locally important memories and meanings. Through
the spatial relationships between monuments, movement of people between places, and ritual
appropriation of history and identity at mound ceremonies, memory and meaning was continually
created and negotiated.

Reconstructing past food preparation activities often relies exclusively on inferences made from

[42] Bitumen Processing and Exchange among the Olmec
Bitumen, found in abundance in Mesoamerica's southern Gulf Coast region in natural seeps and
in many archaeological contexts, is an important economic resource and exchange, item that has
received little consideration in Mesoamerica. An analysis of seep bitumen and archaeological
bitumen from Olmec sites provides insights on processing activities, patterns of commodity
exchange, and intra-regional interactions. Processing techniques are inferred from experimental,
chemical, and microscopic work, Gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis is used to
trace archaeological bitumen specimens to their sources and provides data on intra-regional
movement of bitumen, shedding light on patterns of commodity exchange, intra-regional
relationships, and interactions.

[58] The Iconography of Pabellon Molded-Carved Ceramics: An Investigation
During the Terminal Classic period (700-900 CE) Maya potters produced a fine orange ceramic
type known today as Pabellon Molded-Carved. This luxury ware experienced wide distribution,
was copied, and contains complex iconography paired with varied hieroglyphic texts. Stylistically,
the visual adornment indicates broad trends and shifts while iconographically, it displays
repetitive imagery that can be divided into distinct scenes. These groupings seem to reflect
cultural stresses; indeed, an overview of Pabellon scene groupings combined with a careful
analysis of one of the categories - the Reclining Figure Scene - will augment an understanding of
Terminal Classic iconography.

[66] Remapping Authority and Community in the Reducciones of the Colca Valley, Peru
In the 1570s, some 1.5 million Andeans were forcibly resettled from their prehispanic settlements
into European-style villages known as reducciones. Although this radical resettlement program
would seem to epitomize rule by administrative fiat, very little is known about what specific local
criteria were used to determine where reducciones were to be located or how indigenous
communities were to be divided or conjoined to populate them. This paper compares land tenure
patterns derived from colonial censuses with settlement pattern data from the Colca valley to
reconstruct where indigenous communities lived prior to resettlement, thereby providing a window
into these local negotiations.

[107] A Failure of Academic Stewardship
Murray State University took ownership of two archaeological sites in the early 1980s: Wickliffe
Mounds (15Ba4) and Savage Cave (15Lo11). The histories of these sites offer case studies of
stewardship in private and public sectors, and suggest reasons why, in this case, academic
stewardship was untrustworthy: the principles of conservation archaeology shaped a
management plan for Savage Cave that prevented it from being an asset to the university, while
the training and public education functions and heritage value of the Wickliffe Mounds Research
Center were not appreciated sufficiently by the administration to continue funding in a time of tight
budgets.

[89] Agent-Based Modeling of Early Hominid Decision-Making
A key mathematical model for early hominid and primate decision-making is the vector-voting
model. This model simulates a group choosing foraging directions where individuals can
communicate their desired direction and their level of determination for that direction, but not their
underlying rationale. The resultant direction for the group is a weighted sum of all individuals'
desired directions. This model matches the ability and behavior of societies with no symbolic
(language-based) capabilities. We present results showing how the foraging success of this
model is affected by environmental and social factors, including the emergence of language
abilities.

[142] Exploring Nationalism through Material Culture: Personal Adornment and Patriotism in 18th-
Century in Portsmouth, New Hampshire
During the Revolutionary War and in the years following it, Americans were encouraged to use
locally manufactured goods in order to reduce the colonies‘ reliance on imported commodities.
The pressure to abstain from imports came in the form of legal strictures as well as popular
movements. This paper explores the ways in which the residents of Portsmouth, New Hampshire,
adhered to these restrictions through an examination of personal adornment artifacts.
Portsmouth‘s residents complied with and took up this ideology only selectively- maintaining a link

Shamanism is pervasive in indigenous America, is widely thought very ancient, and is believed to
be ultimately derived from "classic" Siberian /central Asian shamanism. Despite these
assumptions, the chronology of New World shamanism has hardly been investigated empirically.
A review demonstrates that it extends back to Paleo-Indian foragers in North America. The
Siberian evidence, in contrast, suggests a first appearance of shamanism at circa 4000 YBP,
among Bronze Age pastoralists. The implications of this circumstance require re-thinking certain
basic cultural historical relationships between the Old and New Worlds.

Archaeologists have modeled Hohokam households on the courtyard group, a set of functionally
differentiated architectural features sharing outdoor space. Research at the West Branch site in
Tucson, Arizona, has modified this approach. Precise chronometric dating revealed a pattern of
paired, functionally similar pit structures. Household organization was redundant, implying
repeated, seasonal occupation rather than year-round habitation. Using this model, the role of
women in the West Branch household is explored. Connections among traditional women's
activities reveal a complicated web centering on farming and associated technologies, including
storage technology, pottery manufacture, food preparation, and supporting ideology.

infuses the traditional narratives of contact with a new and more complex set of questions. Rather
than "explaining" the disappearance of Indians from the historical and political present, (and in so
doing, further alienating Indians from the past) traditional elements of disease, military conquests
and acculturation require critical reexamination if we are to reverse the popular notion that Indians
are a perpetually vanishing People. For reasons explored in this paper, "the borderlands" have
traditionally become the mythic sites of disappearance from not only historical texts, but also from
a contemporary political and cultural landscape. This paper addresses disease, acculturation,
assimilation and "conquests" from the perspective one of the 4 million "invisible Indians" in the

[20] Reexamining the "Guns, Germs and Steel Model of Contact Period Archaeology:"

What responsibilities do archaeologists bear in educating the public about contemporary
indigenous peoples? How do the narratives of archaeology contribute to widely held perceptions
of Indians as either "extinct," "failed," perpetually vanishing, pathologized, or "threatened"
peoples? Are all archaeological sites (by definition) examples of "failed" social experiments? Do
archaeological narratives of failed adaptation, evolution, resource acquisition or environmental
degradation contribute to the contemporary marginality of Native Americans within American
culture and politics? This paper argues that archaeologists should critically re-examine narratives
of contact and colonization which render contemporary Native Americans (both on and off the
Rez) invisible. Using interdisciplinary methods, I argue that narratives of contact and colonization
have been uncritically accepted and reproduced by historians, anthropologists and most
importantly, archaeologists.

provides a tool for targeting future field work. The new model uses line of sight, least cost
distance pathways, viewshed analysis, and commonalities of site attributes to determine the most
probable areas of site locations. This model should increase the rate of prehistoric site discovery
and assist in developing meaningful management plans for the region.

This poster will examine a phase one research project conducted on a steamboat wreck in the
Tennessee River. A mapping and photographic survey was carried out in order to learn the
construction techniques utilized in the building of this ship. This information was used to help
determine an approximate age for the wreck and to determine if their would be need for
excavations to be carried out. The research also attempts to link the steamboat with the people
conducting the steamboat river trade throughout history Florence, Alabama.

[69] New Insights on Hohokam Canal Irrigation Systems on the Middle Gila River, Arizona
Early research on canals in the Middle Gila River Valley by archaeologists like Emil Haury and
Richard Woodbury formed the basis of the first influential models on the technology and
organization of Hohokam canal irrigation agriculture. Canal studies undertaken since then have
expanded our understanding of prehistoric irrigation systems and require us to consider different
perspectives on these issues. This poster presents new insights into Hohokam canal irrigation
technology and organization based on recent investigations along the middle Gila River. We
focus on the structural and organizational dynamics of the Snaketown and Santan canal systems
as case studies.

[100] Culture or Climate? Identifying Anthropogenic Environmental Change in Islamic Period
Southern Portugal
Linking environmental change to human activity remains a difficult task for archaeologists. The
authors report on geoarchaeological research focused on identifying the existence, timing and
extent of anthropogenic ecological degradation in southern Portugal during the late Roman,
Islamic and Christian Medieval periods. Preliminary results, based on archaeological survey and
detailed studies of hillslope soils and fluvial deposits, suggest that increased population densities
during the Islamic period caused widespread erosion and diminished agricultural potential.
Ongoing research promises to illuminate the nature of the Islamic state in Europe, the conditions
that affected its rise and fall, and its interactions with rural populations.

[50] Soil Resources of the Petexbatun Region, Guatemala in Relation to Ancient Maya
Agricultural Production
Agriculture of the ancient Maya in the Petexbatun Region of Guatemala varied over time and
space. We collected soil samples from around the archaeological site of Aguateca, Guatemala to
measure the extent of ancient agriculture. We characterized soil properties, including 13C/12C
ratios that serve as an indicator of ancient cultivation maize, a C4 plant. The soil samples were
collected from transects to the north and south of the site and from various landforms, such as
depressions, slopes, and wetlands. We find that maize was cultivated extensively but not
uniformly in the region over a long period.

remains, revealing a complex landscape of non-mortuary stone monuments and microlithic
artifact scatters. Our survey data reveals extensive information on patterns of logistical mobility
and landscape use in the steppe-desert as well as the close relation of habitation sites to large
monuments from the time preceding the appearance of Bronze Age pastoral nomadism in the
region.

[20] Material Possessions: Afghanistan's National Heritages and Archaeological Ethics
This session challenges archaeologists to consider their place in the broader scheme of the
western academic canon, specifically our potential contributions to post-colonial studies. One
aspect of the academic canon has been its aversion to practical or applied topics, an issue not
addressed by post-colonial theory. This paper focuses on the preservation of national heritages
and our ethical stands with respect to the trade in antiquities. After a flurry of excitement within
some archaeological quarters with the destruction of the Bamiyan statues, individual
archaeologists and our professional organizations have been silent, in spite of continued looting
and destruction.

[26] Ethnohistoric Adaptation to Euroamerican Settlement of the Carson Sink
In addition to the archaeological record, we know from oral histories, ethnographic literature, and
written accounts of early European explorers, that marsh and lacustrine resources were important
to Native Americans of the Great Basin. However, few researchers have examined how
Euroamerican waterway modification affected the availability of these key resources to Native
Americans. These changes are likely reflected in Native American social structure, landscape
use, and tool and food choices during the historic-period. Using information available for the
Carson Sink of Nevada, Northern Paiute adaptation to farming and ranching in one of their core
resource areas is explored.

[50] Determining Burial Chronology by Fluoride Analysis of Bone from the Maya Archaeological
Site of Chau Hiix, Belize
Fluoride levels measured in a bone sample did not consistently reflect relative dates of the
burials. Comparisons of samples grouped by different burial conditions showed that fluoride
concentrations in bone are highly dependent on water drainage. Burials that are shallow or that
are in intrusive pits with loose soil consistently had higher fluoride concentrations than earlier
interments buried in tightly packed construction middens or beneath plaster floors. Comparisons
of samples grouped by age-at-death and comparisons of multiple samples from the same
individual show that fluoride levels vary consistently according to the density and thickness of the
bone rather than date.

[153] In the Belly of the Beast: Theory, Ideology and Archaeological Identity
The dominant ideology of archaeology's class structure is that we labor in either academia or
CRM. Examining the internal hierarchy of academia forces the recognition that most
archaeologists work at liberal arts institutions where their labor functions to reproduce the
dominant system. This realization prompts questions about where theory fads come from and
how they function ideologically. In this paper, we consider these issues in the context of how
theory is used to construct an archaeological identity that obscures the role we play within the
dominant political-economic framework of higher education geared toward reproducing the
structure of capitalist social relations.

[24] Gender and Archaeology in Utah
In recent decades feminist scholarship has played an increasing role in archaeology. The growing
interest in gender has resulted in projects documenting the activities of women archaeologists
with the goal of publicizing women's contributions which were often discounted in the male-
dominated field of archaeology. This attention to gender has tended to concentrate research on
certain regions of the U.S.A. Some areas, such as Utah have received less attention. This work
examines Utah archaeology, investigating both the numbers and status of women currently active
in state archaeology and the history of Utah archaeology with a focus on women's contributions
to the field.

[58] The Lady or The Jaguar?: Rio Blanco Cihuateteo Bowls from Veracruz
Veracruz artists adorned steep-sided bowls with narrative scenes rendered in sculpted relief.
These Rio Blanco ceramics illustrate Late Classic creation mythology, rubber ballgame rituals,
and long distance trade, as costumed figures animate the rotational surface of the vessel walls.
Images of the cihuateteo, women who die during childbirth, are ubiquitous in southern Veracruz,
underlying a death cult connected with the underworld, childbirth, and midwifery. Consistent with
this tradition, parturient female iconography adorns a subset of Rio Blanco bowls, the full-frontal
apotropaic pudendum conveying the power of regenerative transformation, a feline portal
between human and supernatural, the living and the dead.

[20] Social Context and the Construction of Alternative Archaeological Histories in Belize and
Postcolonial theory often claims global relevance, but we argue that it is always refracted through
local lenses. We use three recent case studies in Belize and Guatemala to argue that the specific
local social contexts in which archaeological knowledge is produced condition not only the
resulting histories, but also the ways by which they are constructed. We pay special attention to
the roles of different constituencies or stake-holders and of multi-scalar political-economic
structures in the construction of archaeological histories, especially as they impact the
construction of the archaeological research design, its implementation, the interpretation of
results, and their subsequent dissemination.

[60] DNA Species Identification of Archaeological Faunal Remains
Ancient DNA analysis has now made it feasible to obtain accurate species identifications for
archaeological remains. DNA identification can be applied to all types of faunal remains
regardless of their completeness and maturity. Through two case studies, we present the
advantages of DNA analysis of archaeological faunal remains. We also discuss the associated
challenges that may affect its applicability. The case studies are species identification of salmon
remains (7000-500 BP) and whale remains (4000-200BP) from archaeological sites in British
Columbia, Canada.

[87] Interaction between Ritual and Domestic Space
The original proposal of this research program was that the area immediate to the west the
Akapana pyramid consisted of large and open ritual spaces. However, the excavations of the
area surveyed by georadar suggest a more complex pattern of ritual and monumental spaces.
This apparent co-habitation of the ritual and domestic realm challenges ideas of strict boundaries
between the sacred and the profane. This research presents an alternative model for the use of
space in the monumental core and suggests that the basic structural principles of this spatial
pattern date to the Formative Period.

[14] The Relationship between Physical Properties of Paleolithic Raw Materials and Stone Tool
Manufacture
We analyzed physical properties of the Paleolithic materials to examine the influence of the
quality of these materials on manufacturing tools. Bifacial points excavated from site in the
northeastern region of Japan were chosen as an object for this study, and hardness and strength
of the artifacts were measured. As a result, most of the unfinished points were made of harder
and stronger materials compared with completed points. It should have been difficult to shape the
hard and strong materials into tools elaborately. It was clear that the physical properties of lithic
materials could affect the manufacture of tools.

and mapping at the site of Akte. Akte is a small site located 7.2 km northwest of Motul de San
Jose near the confluence Rio Acte and the Arroyo Cantetul. Despite the small size of the site,
field excavations documented a long history of occupation and located fragments of seven
monuments. Results of investigations near three of these monuments and recently completed
artifact analysis are utilized to discuss Akte's possible function as a small, but relatively complex
rural site within the Motul hinterland.

[28] An Arctic Small Tool Tradition (ASTt) Tent Ring from Anaktuvuk Pass, Alaska
During a reexamination of the Tuktu-Naiyuk site in 2004, NPS investigators identified and

represents a discrete manifestation of one of those postulated components present in the
Anaktuvuk Pass region 2,000-4,000 years ago.

The pioneering archaeology of northeastern Arizona by Kidder, Guernsey, Roberts, and Gladwin
laid the foundations for understanding early villages in the northern Southwest. Subsequent
research, much of which is in the gray literature, has both increased the amount of data on this
topic and documented the range of variation in pithouse sites dating to between A.D. 200 and
800. This paper examines chronological and spatial variation in house form, site organization,
social interaction, and economic strategies to identify factors that lead to increased formalization
in the use of space that characterized sites beginning in the 10th century A.D.

The use of ceramics for ritual purposes is wide spread around the World. The case I want to

decapitation. As we know decapitation is one of the most extended ways for human sacrifice at
least in America. The production of head pots by the people of the Mississippian cultures and
those from the Huastec region, among the representations of trophy heads in Peru, are just an
example of this way of thinking, and how they expressed their beliefs.

[18] Diversity Specialists: Late Chiribaya Production Strategies at the Coastal Desert Spring Site
of Wawakiki, Southern Peru
Pre-Hispanic socio-economic organization along the Andean coast is often understood within the
"Horizontality" model. In this scenario, coastal communities engaged in specialized economic
activities while exchanging for products with other communities of specialists. Throughout the
coastal reaches of the Osmore drainage, settlement distribution and both residential and
mortuary assemblages of Late Intermediate Period Chiribaya populations generally reflect this
socio-economic pattern. However, investigations at the coastal site of Wawakiki demonstrate that
some communities along the coast diversified their production by intensively engaging in multiple
economic activities, suggesting a much more varied and complex means of organization within a
shared cultural tradition.

Catastrophic flooding of Stillwater Marsh in the 1980s exposed prehistoric pit structures, storage
facilities, refuse middens, human burials, and diverse artifact assemblages. Confronted with an
unexpectedly complex record, some archaeologists shifted from salvage efforts to research
designs guided by Human Behavioral Ecology (HBE). Proving productive from both research and
management perspectives, HBE based approaches yielded unanticipated insights about mobility,
subsistence, technology, health, and sexual division of. In addition, predictive site location models
based on optimal foraging theory continue to serve as planning tools for cultural resource
managers throughout the region.

[121] Modeling the Emergence of Neolithic Society from the Perspective of the Near East
Most models of the emergence of Neolithic societies have focused on one of a number of prime
movers. Population pressure, environmental change, resource optimization prerogatives, and
pressures that promote unequal access to resources and social power have all been featured in
explanatory frameworks for the emergence of Neolithic societies in the Near East. None of these
models stand-up well against the increasingly fine grained empirical record of emergent Neolithic
society from this region. It is becoming increasingly clear that a more nuanced approach is
needed capable of weaving together all of these factors into a more compelling explanatory
fabric.
