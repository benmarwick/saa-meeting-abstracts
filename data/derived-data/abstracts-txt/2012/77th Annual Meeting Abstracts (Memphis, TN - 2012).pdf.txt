throughout the world adapted dynamically over time.
Frequently referred to as broad-spectrum revolutions,
archaeologists see these changes as examples of
intensification, whereby economies shifted to resources
requiring higher handling costs. These changes have
been attributed to resource overexploitation,
demographic pressure, climate change or some
combinations thereof. In some places, intensive foraging
economies persisted until the historic period; in others,
they gave way to agricultural adaptations. Papers in this
symposium examine these processes in arid regions of
Argentina, Australia, China and North America.

[13] Native Pots in European Spots: Intercultural
Assemblages from St. Antoine’s Garden
In the current theoretical clime, native objects on colonial

the specific historical contexts – the power relations,
social processes, and behaviors – that produced mixed
assemblages in the first place. Excavations at St.

practices and objects traditionally associated with Native
Americans. This paper frames preliminary results of field
and laboratory analyses within a historical and
comparative context that suggests native people played
a significant but changing role in New Orleans throughout
the eighteenth century.

[196] Co-opting Space and Constructing Memories: An
Analysis of the Northeast Mound at the Aztalan Site in
Jefferson County, Wisconsin
In the Middle Mississippian world, construction of
pyramidal mounds at hinterland sites both creates and
links social memories to a distant place. At the Aztalan
site in Jefferson County, Wisconsin, that distant place is
the prehistoric city of Cahokia, near modern day St.
Louis. This paper details the extant records and materials
from Joan Freeman’s 1964-1968 Wisconsin Historical
Society excavations of the northeast platform mound at
Aztalan. The construction of this monument is viewed as
an act of co-opting existing space in an effort to create
new narratives connected to a larger Mississippian
worldview.
