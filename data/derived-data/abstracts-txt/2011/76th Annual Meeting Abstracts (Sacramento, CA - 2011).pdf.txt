Archaeology remains an active and rapidly changing sub-

caves in the ancient landscape is reflected in the diverse
approaches of its practitioners. Ongoing field
investigations continue to produce new data while
laboratory analyses uncover exciting new information.

into the indigenous representations of these important

(SPONSORED BY PREHISTORIC QUARRY AND EARLY MINES
INTEREST GROUP, CENTER FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF
ANCIENT QUARRIES)
The earth‘s resources have contributed in important ways
to economic and social life in the prehispanic Andes. This
symposium focuses on mining and quarrying in the
Andes throughout prehistory with research on procuring
materials that include stone, metals, clay, colorants, and
salt from primary deposits. Research themes range from
extraction technologies, archaeological sites associated
with mines and quarries, social and ritual elements of
ancient mining, and evidence of contemporary small-
scale mining in the Andes.

(SPONSORED BY PUBLIC EDUCATION COMMITTEE)
Outreach is integral to many archaeological projects and
many archaeologists work with teachers and schools.
These interactions can be valuable reciprocal learning
experiences and build long-lasting partnerships.
However, archaeologists and educators do not always
share the same needs and agendas which can make
exchanges between these stakeholders complex and
even problematic. Successful public archaeology projects
require understandings of educational systems and
extensive collaboration with local educators. This forum
brings together archaeologists and educators with
