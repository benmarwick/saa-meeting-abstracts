[1] OPENING SESSION • ISLANDS IN THE STREAM: INTERISLAND AND CONTINENTAL
INTERACTION IN THE CARIBBEAN
(Sponsored by SAA Annual Meeting Program Committee)
The history of the Caribbean has been a dynamic one that has included a long sequence of
social, cultural, and political processes. Although many of these processes have occurred within
the context of local communities, regions, or islands, they have also included interaction
between islands and, in some occasions, with the continents. This session discusses several
ancient and colonial cases where these last types of interaction may have had a role in the
social, cultural, and political development of the islands.
[2] POSTER SYMPOSIUM • LANDSCAPE RESEARCH AND HERITAGE PRESERVATION: COLLABORATIVE
APPROACHES
Nowhere are collaborations between archaeologists and American Indian tribes more visible—
and necessary—than in the realms of landscape and heritage preservation. Landscapes are
complex phenomena created by unique and contingent biological, geological, and human
histories. Understanding and protecting them requires collaboration in research, management,
and planning, and appreciation for the contributions of different epistemologies. Archaeologists,
natural scientists, land managers and native peoples have different perspectives on how to elicit
meaning from a landscape, explain its evolution, and derive implications for its future. We present
complementary approaches that tribal and archaeological knowledge and values contribute to
understanding landscape history.
[3] POSTER SYMPOSIUM • GIS AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL THEORY: UNDERSTANDING POPULATION
DYNAMICS, SOCIOPOLITICAL CHANGE, AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS
The recent use of GIS in archaeological research has greatly improved our ability to visualize
and interpret large multivariate data sets. The statistical results of these studies have been
impressive. Unfortunately, the integration of GIS analyses with anthropological and demographic
theory has yet to reach the same level of sophistication. Using GIS to build and test theories
regarding demographic processes and cultural development has the potential to improve our
understanding of how ancient people interacted with their natural and cultural environments.
This session focuses on research that combines GIS analyses with anthropological and
demographic theory.

[7] SYMPOSIUM • EARLY VILLAGE SOCIETY IN GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE
The transition to agricultural village lifeways was a process undergone by many prehistoric
societies in many parts of the world. As such, this transition constitutes what Julian Steward
called a "phenomenon of limited occurrence," a constellation of social, cultural, and economic
forces, pressures, adaptations, and accommodations that operated in comparable ways in
many of these prehistoric contexts. This symposium brings together papers from several
regions of the world in order to identify and discuss a range of social processes, tensions, and
transformations that characterize the dynamics of early villages worldwide and that may be
fruitfully employed in cross-cultural analysis.
[8] SYMPOSIUM • NEW WORLD SHELLMOUNDS AND SHELLMIDDENS: A BICOASTAL
COMPARISON
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on the Americas)
We characterize New World Atlantic and Pacific coastal occupations and explore the concepts
of shellmound and shellmidden. Archaeology has long investigated mounds composed primarily
of shell and fish bone. There are two lines of interpretation about site function and formation
processes: one sees sites as domestic spaces and mounds as the result of midden
accumulation; the other considers sites as funerary spaces in which faunal remains are grave
goods and building material. We evaluate whether these perspectives are socially distinct

realities that may or may not be coterminous in any given site, or if they result from different
research agendas.
[9] SYMPOSIUM • DEDICATED TO THE REAL COSTEÑO: PAPERS IN HONOR OF FREDERICK J. BOVE
Archaeological remains of the Pacific coast of southern Mesoamerica record a number of key
developments in Mesoamerican prehistory, from early agricultural impacts on the tropical forest
to Pipil immigration during the 14th century. This symposium will present results related to the
culture history of the Pacific coast. Key features of this record have been brought to light by
survey and excavation projects of Fred Bove and collaborators over the past 30 years. Bove
dedicated his 1989 edited volume "to the costeños," and we think it is fitting that we dedicate a
symposium synthesizing results of recent research on the Pacific coast to the real costeño.
[10] SYMPOSIUM • BIOARCHAEOLOGICAL INSIGHTS INTO ANCIENT IMPERIALISM: PERSPECTIVES FROM
THE OLD AND NEW W ORLDS
Archaeological studies of imperialism have examined changes in material culture, settlement
patterns, and the built environment, yet the effect of imperialism on the body, both as a physical
and social entity remain less explored. This session demonstrates that skeletal analysis is not an
end in itself, but when situated within its archaeological context and placed in a theoretical
framework aimed at elucidating past imperial strategies and effects, bioarchaeology can address
issues such as the role of militarism and violence; ethnogenesis; use of the body in ritual; forced
migration; and unequal access to resources, among others. The papers cover a wide
geographical and temporal range to highlight similar anthropological themes addressed by those
studying ancient empires.
[11] FORUM • STORIES AND STRATEGIES: DIALOGUES ON EQUITY ISSUES IN ARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on the Status of Women in Archaeology)
Equity issues in archaeology have been addressed in a variety of ways at different moments in
the history of our discipline. Recent survey data on the perceptions and status of different
demographics within archaeology come from the SAA Member Needs Assessment Survey and
the jointly sponsored salary survey. These surveys demonstrate significant differences in how
different individuals and groups of individuals experience being an archaeologist. This forum is
centered on several small focus groups that will discuss issues of participation, representation,
and ethics. These groups will be brought together to discuss strategies for addressing equity
issues in the future.
[12] GENERAL SESSION • CERAMIC ANALYSES IN SOUTH AMERICA
[13] SYMPOSIUM • WORKING IT: ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO LABOR, LEISURE, AND
PLACE
The contributors cast a critical eye upon two pairs of social/spatial categories central to
archaeological thought: work/leisure and workplace/residence. These papers focus on the social
relations, practices, and lived experiences within and between these social/spatial categories.
Practices and experiences are at once structured by spaces, while they simultaneously
construct/reconstruct ideas of both the social and the spatial. We attempt to examine the often
neglected conceptual and spatial linkages between these categories of activity and place,
revealing the assumptions that underlie these seemingly dichotomous social constructions. We
seek to build historically contingent and specific understandings of labor, leisure, and place.
[14] GENERAL SESSION • MESOAMERICAN AGRICULTURE, DIET AND POPULATION
[15] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY OF RELIGION AND RITUAL
Religion is dynamic, constantly being crafted (through symbols and myths) and being enacted
(through the practice of ritual acts). Ancient religious life is irreducibly complex and our
understanding of it is partial. Yet, it seems possible to go beyond the particulars of specific
cultures and to theorize. This session explores the theoretical and methodological approaches
to an archaeology of religion, specifically, how we identify the material remains of religious life in
the archaeological record and the extent to which we may see religion as a force in other
domains such as ethnicity, political economy or gender.
[16] SYMPOSIUM • NEW METHODS AND TECHNIQUES IN THE STUDY OF MATERIAL CULTURE FROM
THE CARIBBEAN
During the past years, Caribbean archaeologists have used and developed new methods and
, ABSTRACTS OF THE SAA 71st ANNUAL MEETING                                                          5
techniques for the study of material culture, such as provenance studies, usewear analysis,
starch residue and phytolith analysis, experimental research, ethoarchaeological studies,
geochemical analysis and DNA-studies. These approaches have shown their merits in recently
excavated sites throughout the region and have provided new information on technological
systems, mobility, exchange and social organization. The purpose here is to bring these
innovative techniques together and to assess possible avenues of mutual benefits and
integration. This may lead to new research questions for the archaeology of the Caribbean in
general.
[17] SYMPOSIUM • INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACHES TO UNDERSTANDING THE OLDOWAN
(Sponsored by Wenner-Gren Foundation of Anthropological Research)
The emergence of material culture is arguably one of the most significant events in human
evolution. Discoveries from ongoing field projects and re-analyses of previously excavated
collections have expanded our conceptual framework of early stone tools. This is true for
Oldowan industries in Africa as well as the earliest evidence of these industries in Eurasia. The
most evident conclusion of the newest round of research on "Oldowan" industries is that these
assemblages are found in diverse contexts. This symposium will incorporate a variety of
perspectives on Plio-Plesitocene sites providing a unique investigation of Oldowan hominin
behavior.
[18] SYMPOSIUM • FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY
Forensic archaeology is a two-fold field straddling both the ancient and modern world. In the
context of a criminal investigation, the application of archaeological techniques to disaster
scenes, mass graves, and shallow burials, provides law enforcement officials with a wealth of
information including depositional history and the recovery of small finds. From "ground zero" to
several recent cases of homicide, the utilization of such skills is on the increase as more police
services around the world are exposed to their benefits. In ancient contexts, the utilization of
forensic techniques can better our understanding of burial sites, human remains, and material
culture. Facial reconstruction, cause of death determination, and even fingerprinting are all
forensic fields that can and have greatly contributed to archaeology. This session aims to discuss
current research, case studies, and the theory and methodology behind forensic archaeological
practices.
[19] SYMPOSIUM • THE SPREAD OF AGRICULTURE IN EUROPE: LOOKING FORWARD TO A NEW
CONSENSUS
Population dispersal models are once again becoming the dominant explanation for the spread
of agriculture in Europe and beyond. Such models predominantly draw on recent advances in the
study of molecular and classical genetic markers, comparative linguistics and radiocarbon dating
and are based on high-level generalizations that overlook the complexity of regional
(pre)histories and the role of local Mesolithic communities in agricultural transition. This session
considers methodological and interpretive problems within the demic diffusion paradigm and
offers cogent reasons for more nuanced approaches; aims to identify new questions, and work
towards establishing a new consensus for archaeologists, geneticists and anthropologists.
[20] [withdrawn]
[21] SYMPOSIUM • GENDER IN THE ANDES
Where archaeology has addressed gender in the Andes it has often been constrained by
pictures painted in the Spanish chronicles. These records, while remarkable for their details and
potential insights, tend to assume much about males and masculinity and confine women to
rather marginal roles – virgins, wives and witches. Gender in the Andes will address gendered
perspectives on societies throughout the Andean region in an attempt to critique and look
beyond the models available from historical records. The scope of the papers represent a wide
range of times and places in the history of complex societies in western South America.
[22] SYMPOSIUM • GEOPROSPECTION AND HERITAGE MANAGEMENT
Geoprospection - magnetic, electromagnetic, acoustic and radar techniques -have become
increasingly used in heritage management projects. "Heritage" refers to those archaeological
resources managed by state and federal agencies and include parks, forests, wildlife areas, etc.
Our presentations include sites found at U.S. state parks (Etowah Mounds); public cemeteries
(Dallas, TX); provincial parks in Italy (Sangro-Abruzzo), as well as more strictly methodological
papers concerning geoprospection and archaeological resources per se.

[23] SYMPOSIUM • THE GULF COAST OLMEC SYMPOSIUM
During the Formative period (circa 1800 BC to AD 150), significant portions of the Southern Gulf
Coast region of Tabasco and Veracruz, Mexico were inhabited by the Olmec, one of
Mesoamerica's earliest complex societies. Recently, innovative methodological and theoretical
approaches have been combined with traditional survey and excavation techniques to address
questions concerning demography and settlement patterns, ceramic chronologies, sociopolitical
organization, and cultural continuity in the region. Archaeologists from Mexico and the United
States will present accounts of their work and results from ongoing field and research projects
that shed new light on this ancient culture.
[24] FORUM • REVISITING THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON HISTORIC PRESERVATION'S HUMAN
REMAINS AND GRAVE GOODS POLICY
The Advisory Council on Historic Preservation is revising its ―Policy Statement Regarding
Treatment of Human Remains and Grave Goods,‖ adopted in 1988. The policy is a formal
statement, representing the membership‘s collective thinking, about what to consider in reaching
decisions about human remains and funerary objects encountered in Section 106 undertakings.
The ACHP‘s Archaeology Task Force has been seeking comments on the current policy and
proposed revisions to it. This forum is designed to provide a place for the professional
archaeological community to share its views on the treatment of human remains and funerary
objects within the Section 106 process.
[25] GENERAL SESSION • TRADE IN THE M AYA REGION
[26] FORUM • IMPACTS OF THE RAPIDLY CHANGING UNIVERSITY ENVIRONMENT ON STUDENT
EDUCATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
(Sponsored by SAA Student Affairs Committee)
Department configurations are changing as educational models increasingly emphasize thematic
and area studies. A recent trend in higher education is the creation of area studies programs that
cross-cut multiple disciplines and departments. Archaeologists are called upon to participate in
programs outside their department, like the development of Latin American, East Asian, or urban
health, medical or biocultural programs. This forum will discuss issues of how archaeology
functions in this environment; effects on student curriculum; benefits or problems for students;
projections of changes and challenges in the job market; the effect of cross-discipline boundaries
on research and dissertation grant writing.
[27] GENERAL SESSION • SYMBOLS AND RELIGION IN MEXICO AND THE US SOUTHWEST
[28] SYMPOSIUM • NEOLITHIC CATTLE OF THE NORTHEASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
Papers in this symposium discuss the biological characteristics and cultural significance of
cattle (Bos) in the Neolithic of the northeastern Mediterranean: Cyprus and Anatolia and as far
inland as Armenia. Archaeological research in this region is currently providing researchers with
considerable new information about human-cattle interactions in early agricultural societies.
These papers offer new data and interpretations as they address the origins and development
of cattle domestication; the morphological characteristics of Neolithic cattle; the economic
significance of cattle in different regions and across time; and the symbolic roles played by Bos
in the Anatolian Neolithic.
[29] SYMPOSIUM • EMBRACING THE DARK SIDE: ON-GOING RESEARCH IN MESOAMERICAN CAVE
ARCHAEOLOGY
Mesoamerican cave archaeology has experienced an explosive growth over the last decade as
large-scale surface archaeological investigations, particularly in the Maya area, regularly include
a cave component. This has resulted in the rapid accumulation not only of new data, but also of
new insights and new analytical techniques. This session attempts to present the results of this
latest research. While papers cover a range of issues, the focus on larger social, political and
economic issues is noteworthy as a trend in cave archaeology.
[30] SYMPOSIUM • RECENT WORK ON PREHISTORIC MINES AND QUARRIES
(Sponsored by English Heritage, Cambridge, U.K.)
This symposium will present the results of recent or ongoing projects which focus upon
prehistoric extraction sites of all types. Presentations may review evidence of site structure,
extraction technology, methods of artifact production, associated artifact assemblages, onward
distribution networks and linkages with settlements. Themes such as seasonal use and the scale

of associated settlements (temporary or permanent) can be considered. Through addressing
some of these themes it is hoped a more holistic understanding of the role and social importance
of prehistoric extraction sites will be gained.
[31] GENERAL SESSION • THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SLAVERY AND EMANCIPATION
[32] SYMPOSIUM • BEHAVIORAL COMPLEXITY IN THE MIDDLE AND LATE PLEISTOCENE IN AFRICA
The complexity of human behavior increased dramatically between the end of the Acheulean and
the beginning of the Later Stone Age. Many features of modern behavior that are considered
characteristic of the Upper Paleolithic first appeared in Africa during the Middle Stone Age.
Therefore, the archaeological record of Africa is essential for understanding the evolution of
modern behavior. Papers in this session will focus on the archaeological evidence for behavioral
change and/or behavioral complexity in technology, typology, function, subsistence, resource
exploitation, land use and social and territorial organization in Africa during this important period
in human behavioral evolution.
[33] GENERAL SESSION • MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE YUCATÁN PENINSULA
[34] SYMPOSIUM • THE CHIBCHA EXPANSION AND THE RISE OF COMPLEX SOCIETIES IN THE
INTERMEDIATE AREA
The Intermediate Area of Central and South America lying between Mesoamerica and the
Central Andes witnessed the emergence of diverse complex societies in the centuries prior to
the Spanish conquest. Most of these societies seem traceable to the northward and southward
expansion of Chibchan peoples out of Costa Rica and Panama. Archaeological, ethnohistoric,
genetic and linguistic evidence is used to understand better the Chibchan expansion and the
factors that impelled it and the rise of many large chiefdoms, especially in Colombia. Some
neighboring societies only very distantly related to the Chibchans are also included for study.

[37] WORKING GROUP • MAYA-HIGHLAND MEXICAN INTERACTION DURING THE LATE
POSTCLASSIC PERIOD
The theme of interaction for this working group arose from two workshops that were recently held
at Tulane University on "Issues in the Provenience and Dating of the Maya Madrid Codex." One
of the topics that emerged from the discussions involved the relationship between the Madrid
Codex and the Borgia Codex from the central Mexican highlands. As several of the presentations
revealed, the two manuscript traditions show significant stylistic and structural parallels, many of
which had not been previously noted. The consensus of the participants from the two workshops
was that there were substantial contacts between the areas where the two manuscripts were
painted, reopening the question of what types of interaction characterized Mesoamerica during
the Late Postclassic period when these two codices are believed to have been produced.
Continuing research of the Madrid and Borgia codices suggests that the connections between
the two manuscripts are not simply the result of diffusion or a shared stylistic tradition, but rather
that there was some sort of interchange between the scribes. Interaction of this nature raises the
question of what other types of cultural contact can be discerned in the archaeological record of
these two areas in Late Postclassic Mesoamerica. Archaeological investigations focusing on this
time period in both the northern Maya region and the Mexican highlands provide a body of data
and material that has only recently become available to address this issue. Additionally,
epigraphic and linguistic studies have reached a new level of sophistication allowing micro-as
well as macro-analysis of the textual data. Recent progress on these two fronts makes this an
opportune time to revisit these issues. Our proposed working group will set the stage for an in-
depth examination of Maya-highland Mexican interaction during the Late Postclassic era in order
to place the findings from our codical studies within a broader archaeological, linguistic, and
historical context. We have invited a diverse group of scholars whose research with material
culture, architecture, iconography, hieroglyphic texts, and linguistics from both areas of Mes-
oamerica will shed light on these issues. Because of the complexities of codical research and the
wide-sweeping nature of the material to be covered by the participants, we believe that a working
group, instead of a session of fifteen-minute presentations, will better serve our collective inquiry.
Additionally, our working group session brings to the SAA meetings an interdisciplinary group of
researchers who might not otherwise attend an archaeological conference.

[38] POSTER SYMPOSIUM • EXPLORING SOME DIFFERENT FACES OF PUBLIC EDUCATION IN
ARCHAEOLOGY TODAY
(Sponsored by SAA Public Education Committee)
Today's public archaeology activities are as diverse as those associated with traditional
research. They range from nation-wide programs sponsored by federal agencies such as the
USDA Forest Service and the SAA, to individual lesson plans which address specific state and
national history and social studies education standards. This symposium will allow participants to
glimpse this diversity by examining the Passport in Time program, the new SAA public education
Web site, and a lesson plan which uses primary resources to address the solution of an
archaeological problem while addressing Pennsylvania history education standards.

The Valles Caldera National Preserve was created in 2000 as a public land management
experiment in this 89,000-acre former private ranch nestled inside a volcanic caldera in the
Jemez Mountains of northern New Mexico. The posters in this symposium demonstrate how
the VCNP Cultural Resources Program is working to integrate research and management in a
complex cultural and natural landscape. The presentations report on new surface and
subsurface investigations, development of data recovery and information management
systems, fire effects monitoring, and the productive integration of archaeology with geology
and geomorphology.

(Sponsored by SAA Government Affairs Committee)
For many decades the global community has attempted to prevent the pillaging of and
trafficking in the cultural heritage of nations through a framework of international treaties and
laws. This forum will examine that framework – its history, its processes, and its effectiveness;
and the U.S. participation in this effort. Discussion will also focus on recent developments in
Latin America, and how the SAA has worked to increase protections for archaeological
materials and objects of cultural patrimony in that region.
[46] SYMPOSIUM • CENTENNIAL REFLECTIONS AND CHALLENGES: THE ANTIQUITIES ACT OF 1906
AND ITS LEGACY PART I
(Sponsored by The Board of Directors of the Society for American Archaeology)
2006 marks the centennial of the first broad legislative protection for archaeology in the United
States. The 1906 Antiquities Act set important legal precedent and indelibly imprinted
archaeology within the political domain. The Act was a product of its time and a construct replete
with politicking. Political engagement by archaeologists over the past century in efforts to
advance the care, protection, and enhancement of archaeological resources is highlighted in this
session through discussion of the Antiquities Act and ARPA. The session aims to connect
insights garnered from past political contexts to both present and future political strategizing.
[47] SYMPOSIUM • THE DEAD TELL TALES: JANE E. BUIKSTRA AND NARRATIVES
 OF THE PAST (PART I)
One of the most important legacies of Jane Buikstra‘s work has been the contextualization of
biological analyses in archaeological studies. This integrated approach led to the emergence of
bioarchaeology, a field that she has shaped into a mature sub-discipline of archaeology.
Beginning with her seminal work in Illinois, this multidisciplinary approach has revolutionized
archaeological investigation throughout the world, shedding light on hitherto unexplored social
and political dimensions of human behavior in the past. This symposium showcases the work of
her many students/colleagues in the field of Bioarchaeology, focussing on the Americas, as
testament to her pioneering research.

Investigations at San Bartolo continue to enlighten and expand upon current scholarship by
providing significant new data on Maya art, religion, settlement, architecture, environment and
technology. The San Bartolo Project has contributed to the field in general via the application of
groundbreaking technologies in the areas of reconnaissance, survey and conservation. This
symposium will present the most important finds to come out of research at the site since
excavations began in 2002. The talks will explore the significance of the spectacular murals for
which San Bartolo is known and will contextualize them within the site, the region, and in time.
[49] SYMPOSIUM • SPATIAL AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION OF MESOAMERICAN CITIES
Contributions to this session examine variation in the layout of specific Mesoamerican cities in
an effort to determine how these centers were formed and organized. Papers will document
spatial patterns from the forms and spatial distributions of residences, public buildings, and
artifacts, and use these data to infer social processes and organization principles. The goal is
to update Joyce Marcus's (1983) influential paper on Mesoamerican cities and city forms.
Authors will present new models and fresh perspectives on Mesoamerican urban form, in
addition to new data from fieldwork and archival research.
[50] SYMPOSIUM • RECENT RESEARCH AND CHANGING VIEWS OF EASTER ISLAND PREHISTORY
Remote and diminutive Easter Island, long famous for its monumental statues and architecture,
has been the focus of recent field research, popularized accounts, and rethinking of some of the
orthodox views about its prehistory. In this symposium we bring together field researchers and
others to present recent findings and discuss the implications for issues including chronology of
the island‘s colonization; statue manufacture, transport, and relatedness; community patterns;
subsistence; ―ecocide,‖ genocide, and the alleged ―self-destruction‖ (―collapse‖); human genetic
variability; and problems with data access, publishing, and the related, urgent needs for historic
preservation.
[51] SYMPOSIUM • THEORIZING THE LATE INTERMEDIATE PERIOD IN THE ANDES: LARGE-SCALE
PATTERNS, LOCAL TRAJECTORIES
This session aims to develop approaches to the Late Intermediate Period (ca. AD 1000-1450)
as a whole, rather than as a patchwork of unrelated local histories. Although defined as a time
of regional differentiation, this period witnessed several large-scale patterns: defensive
settlement; political fragmentation and limited reconsolidation; chulpa burial and ancestor
worship; local ethnic identities evident in documentary sources; etc. Are these patterns tied to
the collapse of earlier polities, climate, migrations, or interaction between regions? How closely
related were coastal and highland developments? This session seeks to theorize such large-
scale patterns while incorporating local processes and local political activity.
[52] SYMPOSIUM • AN EXPLORATORY STUDY INTO THE CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF
CARIBBEAN CERAMICS: IN MEMORY OF JAMES B. PETERSEN
The Caribbean region is one of the most underrepresented areas in the world for chemical
characterization studies of ancient material culture. This session explores the potential of
integrating chemical characterization studies with archaeological investigations by examining
several recent case studies in historic and prehistoric Caribbean contexts. Questions of ancient
population movements, the development of exchange networks within and between various
island archipelagoes, and local adaptations and historical developments from ca. 500 BC up to
and including the time of Euroamerican contact and colonialism are addressed.
[53] SYMPOSIUM • THE PRECERAMIC RECORD OF THE CENTRAL ANDES: ASSESSING THE
CAUSES AND CONTEXTS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY FROM A PAN-ANDEAN PERSPECTIVE
Over 50 years of archaeological and paleoclimatic research in the Central Andes reveals
significant variability in Preceramic foraging strategies and changing biogeographic conditions
during the Early and Middle Holocene. Yet we do not understand the degree to which
settlement and subsistence adaptations reflect changing environmental conditions, migration
routes, access to and exploitation of marine and terrestrial resources, interaction with inland
cultures, and sociocultural factors. This symposium provides a forum for a comparative
assessment of key human ecological variables that have impacted the developmental
trajectory of Andean cultural complexes in the coastal plains, inland valleys, and highlands of
the Central Andes.

[54] SYMPOSIUM • USES OF THE PAST: NEGOTIATING SOCIAL CHANGE THROUGH MEMORY AND
TRADITION
Social change creates tension within and between social groups. To mitigate this tension, agents
have evoked the past in negotiating new social forms. This session examines how memory and
tradition are used and manipulated during and after periods of change. Here, memory and
tradition complement each other. Memory—as commemoration, habit, or forgetting—performs
both active and passive roles as groups retain and discard ideas, practices, and symbols.
Tradition, as past practice, can be employed by agents to subvert or legitimize their present
social relations. The papers in this session examine how agents invoked the past to remake their
present.
[55] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY AND ANTHROPOLOGY OF DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL
COMPLEXITY DURING THE NEOLITHIC IN EURASIA
The session will explore the opportunity to develop the knowledge on Neolithic in Eurasia as
a result of testing theories about complexity in multi-scale regional context and new
archaeological data. We will attempt to approach a variety of problems: technology and social
complexity; complexity and the transition from hunter-gathering toward sedentary societies;
household as an elementary social unit; marriage, family and kinship; problems of
interpretations of Neolithic archaeological data; cognitive archaeology and social complexity;
the inhabited place as a product and producer of social complexity; Neolithic social and
political organizations; and regional development and common Neolithic concepts.

[58] SYMPOSIUM • INTELLECTUAL CHALLENGES IN ARCHAEOLOGY: CONFRONTING GENDER IN THE
WORKPLACE AND IN THE PAST
(Sponsored by SAA Women in Archaeology Interest Group)
Despite recent advances, the field of archaeology remains a difficult arena for tackling issues of
gender. This can be true regardless of whether the focus is on gender in the past or in the
present. Indeed, there is often overlap between the challenges of engendering the past and
coping with present day gender concerns. This symposium provides a forum for the discussion
of the challenges surrounding gender which are faced by archaeologists both in the workplace
and in their research. These papers address the challenges of doing gender studies in
archaeology as well as confronting gender issues in the discipline.
[59] SYMPOSIUM • THE AFRICAN MIDDLE STONE AGE
The Middle Stone Age began around 300,000 and continued to around 35,000 years ago in
Africa. During this period anatomically modern humans emerged in Africa. Also during this period
increasingly sophisticated technological innovations and the earliest evidence for symbolic
thought entered into the archaeological record. All of these events are critical for our
understanding of modern human origins. This symposium presents current Middle Stone Age
research from multiple points of reference, helping to place this important period of our evolution
in context.
[60] SYMPOSIUM • AGENCY, SETTINGS AND ARCHITECTURE IN ANDEAN ARCHAEOLOGY
This symposium considers the utility of the concept of agency for the analysis of settings and the

Those who have seen examples of 3D-scanned archaeological material agree that 3D models
are accurate and startlingly realistic. Besides being featured in the media and as novelties,
however, these data serve an important and expanding role in mainstream field and lab
documentation, analysis, and outreach. Many archaeologists now use scanning technology in
their workflows to save time and money, while benefiting from exponentially greater accuracy,
resolution, and quality than traditional methods. This symposium openly addresses real-life 3D
laser and CT scanning projects that are taking 3D digital documentation to the next level.
[63] GENERAL SESSION • ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOUTH AND EAST ASIA
[64] SYMPOSIUM • AN ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACH TO M AYA RITUAL CAVE USE
During the development of Maya cave studies ethnographers have played only a minor role.
Ethnographic data, however, have been recognized as being extremely valuable in forming
models of ancient cave use and in documenting unsuspected practices that have ancient
counterparts. As a result, archaeologists are increasingly seeking input from indigenous
populations on an array of cave related issues. This session presents the results of
ethnographic research carried out in the Guatemalan highlands by archaeologists. The papers
focus not simply on rituals within caves but also on community social organization surrounding
the access, maintenance, and use of these important features.
[65] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAIC TO POSTCLASSIC IN THE SHADOW OF PARICUTIN, MICHOACÁN,
MEXICO: NEW INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH COLLABORATING WITH A PURÉPECHA COMMUNITY
Recent archaeological excavations by interdisciplinary teams, working with Purépecha
leadership, in Parangaricutiro (near Paricutin), Michoacán, Mexico, document cultural change in
the Meseta Tarasca from Archaic through Late Postclassic. Participants will discuss
environmental-geological contexts for human occupation (Archaic rockshelter burial (circa 5000
years ago) and Late Postclassic ceremonial center (circa 1000 years ago) of high elevation
mountain plateau, osteological results from an Archaic burial, iconographic analysis and
innovative field applications of non-destructive in situ XRF techniques of cliff painting pigments.
Ongoing research questions explore origins of Purépecha civilization, iconography, material
culture, and economic relationships with Mesoamerica.
[66] GENERAL SESSION • APPROACHES TO THE PEOPLING OF THE NEW WORLD
[67] SYMPOSIUM • EXAMINING REGIONAL INTERACTION IN POSTCLASSIC PERIOD OAXACA: NEW
DATA FROM RECENT RESIDENTIAL EXCAVATIONS AND ARTIFACT ANALYSES
This session synthesizes new data from excavations in a number of regions of Oaxaca that
increase our understanding of the participation of Oaxacan polities in networks linking them with
Mesoamerica in the Postclassic Period. Participants will consider their data in light of Smith and
Berdan´s (2003) characterization of "The Postclassic Mesoamerican World as a constellation of
distinct societies that were highly integrated primarily through economic and ideological
networks." Smith and Berdan note it has been difficult to consider Postclassic Oaxaca at the
macroregional level because of the paucity of published archaeological reports and its poorly
developed Postclassic Period chronology.

[73] WORKING GROUP • QUARRIES, MINES, WORKSHOPS AND FACTORIES: STANDARDIZING
NOMENCLATURE FOR THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL COMMUNITY
(Sponsored by LaPorta and Associates, L.L.C., Geological Consultants)
Prehistoric quarries and mines are an imposing resource. The research of prehistoric quarries
and early mines is the definition of interdisciplinary research. It necessarily combines advanced
theoretical constructs taken from the geological sciences, mining engineering, cultural
anthropology and archaeology. As a result of the interdisciplinary ties needed to understand
prehistoric quarries and early mines, a vast, and sometimes unclear, nomenclature has been
developed that needs classification and clarification in order for the field to be advanced
scientifically. A consensus must be built in the prehistoric quarry and early mine community on
what the various interdisciplinary terms mean and what anthropological and archaeological
interpretations should, or should not, be inferred by the use of certain terminology. Definitions of
quarries, and related terms such as mines, surface mines, exploration pits, galleries, workshops,
factories and prospects all need to be made clear and understood to the archaeological
community interested in the resource. The intent is to create a working group of scientists and
scholars from diverse fields, from all corners of the greater realm of anthropology, archaeology
and geology, who have a common interest in quarries and raw material sources; whether that
interest is in raw material extraction, the culture of mine communities (i.e. social stratification and
ethnicity in living quarry and mine communities), allocation, trade and exchange, chemistry,
provenance studies, quarry or mine architecture, sampling design, field methodology and the
chain of operation. As the first step in this process, an international working group is being
proposed to meet at the 2006 Annual Meeting to explore the differences and similarities of the
terms quarries, mines, factories and workshops. Scholarly discussion must be held on what
these terms mean, what is implied by their usage, how their usage includes certain
archaeological sites, and yet excludes others. Why are these terms important? They provide the
foundation for the standardization of a resource that, although finite, can define a landscape. It is
also the origin of the raw materials from which most artifacts and features are derived, the
starting point of their use-life trajectories. The long-term anthropogenic affects resulting from
mineral exploitation convert a uniform landscape to one bearing political reference points. Thus,
this is a resource tied in theory and practicality from the most basic artifact analysis to the most
complex of prehistoric cultural inferences. This problem is considered to be important enough for
the international scientific community to also propose forming an interest group that will meet
annually at the SAA meetings.
[74] POSTER SYMPOSIUM • QUARRIES: WHERE IT ALL BEGAN
Archaeologists often see quarries as a one-stop-shop for lithic materials, with most interesting
behaviors related to stone tool technology occurring away from the quarry. This session focuses
on quarries as not only a source of raw material but also as the launching point for succeeding
steps of lithic technologies. Participants will present empirical data on quarry source areas and
how specific characteristics of raw materials structure subsequent decisions within a raw
material economy. Reduction sequences and chaînes opératoires will provide the
methodological frameworks for understanding how raw material sources structure the
organization of stone tool technology.
[75] POSTER SYMPOSIUM • RECENT RESEARCH ON MIMBRES AREA POTTERY IN THE
AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
The 11th and 12th centuries witnessed economic, social, and religious changes among the
residents of the Mimbres region in southern New Mexico. Recent research has recognized that
these changes both influenced, and were influenced by, social dynamics in other regions of the
American Southwest and beyond. This poster symposium examines the role that black-on-white
pottery played in these social processes. Authors examine multiple dimensions of ceramic
variation -including chemical composition, iconography, decorative style, and provenience -to
explore changes in economic and social organization, intra- and interregional interaction, and
temporal and spatial influences from beyond those of the study area.

[81] FORUM • CENTENNIAL REFLECTIONS AND CHALLENGES: THE ANTIQUITIES ACT OF 1906 AND
ITS LEGACY PART II
(Sponsored by The Board of Directors of the Society for American Archaeology)
2006 marks the centennial of the first broad legislative protection for archaeology in the United
States. The 1906 Antiquities Act set important legal precedent and indelibly imprinted
archaeology within the political domain. The Act was a product of its time and a construct replete
with politicking. Political engagement by archaeologists over the past century in efforts to
advance the care, protection, and enhancement of archaeological resources is highlighted in this
session through discussion of the Antiquities Act and ARPA. The session aims to connect
insights garnered from past political contexts to both present and future political strategizing.
[82] SYMPOSIUM • THE DEAD TELL TALES: JANE E. BUIKSTRA AND NARRATIVES OF THE PAST (PART
II)
The most important legacy of Jane Buikstra‘s work in archaeology and physical anthropology has
been the contextualization of biological analyses in archaeological studies. This integrated
approach led to the emergence of bioarchaeology, now a mature sub-discipline of archaeology.
This multidisciplinary approach has revolutionized archaeological investigation throughout the
world, shedding light on hitherto unexplored social and political dimensions of human behavior in
the past. This symposium showcases the work of her many students/colleagues in the Old
World, as well as theoretical contributions in the field and the legacy of Buikstra‘s pioneering
research.
[83] SYMPOSIUM • DIVERSIFYING PLEISTOCENE SOCIETIES: THEORIES, METHODS, EVIDENCE
Past research on late Pleistocene hunter-gatherers has focused on the stereotypical actions of a
decided minority - namely, those of prime age hunting males, and ignored what the majority that
included the women, the children, and the elderly did on a daily basis. This symposium presents
"state of the art" developments in theories, modeling, and methods of data analysis, as well as
highlights case studies, that diversify our reconstructions of prehistoric societies to include the
actions of many different constituencies whose beliefs and behaviors shaped the archaeological
record we work with -yet who have to date been largely invisible.
[84] SYMPOSIUM • NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT OF THE CARIBBEAN
Archaeological investigations in the islands of the Caribbean have provided a wealth of
information regarding prehistoric human settlement over a period of 6,000 years or more. A
dramatic increase in archaeological and biological research, including advances in DNA analysis,
has substantially improved our knowledge of how and when prehistoric Amerindians settled the
West Indies, their ancestral affiliations, and the rise of social complexity over time and space.
This session examines new data from a host of different perspectives and island groups,
providing a strong foundation for understanding patterns of human colonization, settlement, and
interaction.
[85] SYMPOSIUM • RATIONAL ACTORS IN COMPLEX SOCIETIES: DEFENDING THE ENLIGHTENMENT
PROJECT IN A DARKENING WORLD
Anthropological archaeology has seen the pendulum swing from cultural materialism to post-
modern historicism; least cost models are denounced as impositions of capitalist economic
concepts onto the past; in complex societies resource allocation can best be understood in
political or ideological contexts. Contributors to this symposium value both the importance of
historically contingent institutions and comparative studies. They will suggest that the emergent
dynamic properties of a society's institutional relations can only be evaluated by contrasting
them with a model of individual rational calculation.
[86] SYMPOSIUM • THE OLMEC AND THEIR EARLY FORMATIVE NEIGHBORS
With contributions from scholars working in the Gulf Coast "Olmec heartland" and other regions
of Mesoamerica, this session brings new data to an old but persistent question: What was the
nature of the San Lorenzo Horizon (ca. 1200-900 BC)? Was the art style associated with this
horizon the product of influence and diffusion from the Gulf Coast region, a convergent process
with contributions from many disparate Mesoamerican regions and cultures, or a combination of
regionally-specific phenomenon? Session participants approach this fundamental issue and
many related questions with respect to empirical data, both old and new, thereby providing solid
ground for model building and diverse theoretical perspectives.

[87] SYMPOSIUM • CLASSIC M AYA POLITICAL ECOLOGY IN UPPER NORTHWESTERN BELIZE
From 2001-2005, the Blue Creek Regional Political Ecology Project investigated Maya political
organization in northwestern Belize. Our research builds on Roseberry‘s premise that political
economies are primarily rooted in local traditions. Important, too, is Scott‘s concept of a moral
economy, in which expectations and obligations were negotiated between status groups reliant
on different social and natural resources for their livelihoods. With a temporal focus from the
Early Classic through the Late Classic, our research examines environmental change and
human response, utilitarian production and resource exploitation, and hinterland settlement and
urban construction. We consider our findings in a Lowland Maya geopolitical context.
[88] FORUM • CAREERS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: OPPORTUNITIES, SKILLS, AND DEMANDS OF NON-
ACADEMIC JOBS
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on the Status of Women in Archaeology)
The forum highlights non-academic careers for archaeologists. Participants will discuss a range
of occupations for archaeology graduates based on their own professional experience. Each
discussant will represent a different career option, address a range of topics including skills
needed for such a job, the candidate profile sought, and the variety of professional demands
required by the job. The forum aims to assist junior scholars in thinking about career options with
an archaeology background. It also hopes to convey information to undergraduate and graduate
programs about the demands of non-academic jobs to help them in training students for success
in a wide range of professional careers.
[89] SYMPOSIUM • FISHING FOR THEORY: MODELING THE ECOLOGICAL & SOCIAL DYNAMICS OF
FISHING CULTURES
Fishing cultures provide important contexts for three major theoretical issues in modeling
prehistoric change. One issue is what sets in motion a trajectory of increasing social and political
complexity. A second issue is where prehistoric humans fit in the dynamics of Holocene ecology.
A third issue is the antiquity of fishing as a way of life and the implications of that for prehistoric
coastal migrations, especially in the Americas. The papers in this session apply archaeological
and ethnographic data from the Americas and Oceania to examine these issues.
[90] SYMPOSIUM • HUMAN AGENCY AND ANTHROPOGENIC LANDSCAPES IN AMAZONIA
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on the Americas)
Archaeology in Amazonia redefines conceptions of tropical forests and human-environmental
relations in them. Diverse small- to medium-sized complex societies existed prior to 1492, which
radically transformed many environments. This symposium focuses on aspects of human agency
in this dynamic, including: (1) the agency of past and present indigenous peoples in constructing
Amazonian landscapes; (2) the agency of scientific (and popular) models in representations and
practice of/in Amazonia; and (3) the interaction of contemporary human agency and voice (what
viewpoints are heard in public and decision-making arenas) in contentious areas of economic
development and indigenous cultural rights.
[91] SYMPOSIUM • THE EARTH OF THE MODERN: PARALLEL MODERNITIES AND COLONIAL
SUBJECTIVITIES
Colonialism in the past 500 years is defined by a context of oppression, struggle, and resistance.
It also occurred in a milieu of rapidly changing worldviews embraced by the nebulous concept of
―modernism.‖ Presentations explore archaeology‘s potential for discerning: (1) the divergent
modern tenets emanating from colonial powers in their attempts to mold colonial subjects and
subjectivities; (2) how these efforts were appropriated by the colonized to create their own sense
of modernity. Underlying these studies is the belief that colonialism should be framed by
reference to both power relations and a dramatic, continual reshuffling of a post-medieval order.

This symposium highlights recent research at Chevelon Ruin, a 500-room, 14thcentury Hopi
settlement in northeastern Arizona. It is third largest of the seven villages comprising the
Homol'ovi Settlement Cluster. Within the cluster, Chevelon is unique in being substantially
burned, having access to a permanent flowing stream with unique plant and animal resources,
and participating in long-distance exchange with neighbors to the south. Thus, Chevelon
provides insight into intra-cluster and inter-cluster economic and social relationships and the
roles they play in evolving social complexity in nucleated villages.

[94] FORUM • VISION AND REVISION IN THE SAA CODE OF ETHICS: STEPS TOWARDS INDIGENOUS
INCLUSION
(Sponsored by The SAA Native American Relations Committee and the SAA Committee on
Ethics)
The SAA Committee on Native American Relations suggests that the SAA Principles of
Archaeological Ethics be amended to reflect more clearly the primacy of Native people,
Indigenous groups, and descendant communities with regard to cultural resources. When it
comes to our own cultural heritage, Native people are more than simply one of the many
concerned publics of archaeology. The CNAR has identified a number of concerns and
suggestions for amending or expanding the SAA-PAE, modeled after codes of ethics from other
post-colonial nations. This forum will explore how other codes have been drafted to address
Indigenous concerns.
[95] SYMPOSIUM • POLITICAL AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATIONS IN THE JEQUETEPEQUE VALLEY,
NORTH COAST, PERU
This symposium will examine the dynamic political and cultural landscape of the Jequetepeque
Valley through time, beginning with the Early Moche period and continuing through Inca
conquest. Although fairly limited in its geographical scope, this symposium offers a perspective
of incredible time depth in a region that has been characterized by complex sociopolitical
processes for millennia, and will shed light on greater trends on the North Coast and the Andes
as a whole.
[96] SYMPOSIUM • CURRENT NORTHEAST PALEOETHNOBOTANY: TEN YEARS LATER
In the ten years since the original Current Northeast Paleoethnobotany symposium much has
changed in our knowledge of when, where, and how Native Americans used various plant
species in northeastern North America. Papers in the present symposium provide summaries of
this new knowledge, case studies from specific sites and regions, and discussions of on-going
theoretical and methodological issues in paleoethnobotany.
[97] SYMPOSIUM • MISSION POSSIBLE! CULTURAL RESOURCE PRESERVATION ACROSS THE ARMY
NATIONAL GUARD: PAPERS IN HONOR OF ALAN WORMSER
The idea that the Army National Guard would include cultural resource preservation as part of
mission requirements is a surprising notion to many. However, the Army National Guard has
been building a Cultural Resource Program to address preservation and management of historic
properties at Guard installations across the United States. Planning Level Surveys, Eligibility
Testing, and Data Recovery Mitigations conducted in accordance with Section 110 and Section
106 requirements yield vital information on America‘s early cultures and historic communities.
Lessons learned from Cultural Resource Management along with new knowledge on prehistoric
or historic settlements are discussed in this symposium.
[98] SYMPOSIUM • STONE TOOLS AND THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN COGNITION
Stone tools have been used to reconstruct hominid subsistence strategies, technology and
even exchange networks but in recent years, the study of lithics has been extended to subjects
within the cognitive realm. Research has primarily focused on skill acquisition and
apprenticeship, decision making, the emergence of behavioral modernity, primate tool use,
symbolic dimensions of certain classes of lithics, and the relationship between language and
standardization. Drawing on field work in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Indonesia,
participants from a variety of disciplines will review current evidence for the relationship
between stone tools and the evolution of human cognition.
[99] SYMPOSIUM • NEW TECHNIQUES TO ADDRESS OLD PROBLEMS: A STUDENT'S PERSPECTIVE
Graduate education in anthropology increasingly incorporates new technologically based
approaches. Using sophisticated computer applications and digital media, graduate students
are pursuing anthropological questions regarding site symbolism, human land-use patterns
and social organization, site preservation, public archaeology, and museum imagery. In
addition, as part of their graduate training, students are constructing research designs with
cultural resource management in mind, the results applicable to both researchers and
resource managers. This symposium highlights the recent research efforts of thesis and
applied graduate students attending Northern Arizona University.

The 2005 Fryxell Award in Interdisciplinary Studies honors Bruce D. Smith for his visionary
leadership and pioneering research that applies creative and rigorous interdisciplinary scientific
methods to answer significant questions about the human past. The papers presented in this
symposium highlight innovative approaches to the interdisciplinary study of people-plant
relationships, a topic Smith has engaged throughout his career. These papers address such key
issues as the emergence of food-producing systems, the origins of an agricultural way of life, and
other fundamental details of the human-plant dynamic with emphasis on plant domestication,
land-use patterns, and the origins of crop species.
[110] SYMPOSIUM • THE LEGACY OF BROKEN K: JAMES N. HILL AND AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by AAA Archaeology Division)
James N. Hill was one of the leading figures in the development of the New Archaeology. His
research at Broken K Pueblo is considered classic example of the application of positivism in
archaeology. Among Hill‘s many interests were archaeological philosophy, typology, style,
social organization, and human responses to stress. The goal of this session is to honor these
contributions nearly 10 years after Hill‘s death. The participants and discussants document Hill‘s
wide-ranging influences on archaeological method and theory.
[111] SYMPOSIUM • ACTING AND BELIEVING: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF BODILY PRACTICES
Throughout human history, the human body has been the central medium for ideologies,
worldviews, social and spiritual values and shared meanings. Our session focuses on the body
as the central medium and common ground for communicating and negotiating ideational
aspects of human existence worldwide. This perspective builds on the unity of ideational and
corporeal experience through the notion of embodied agency. Archaeological themes
considered include the representation and evidence of human bodies routinely in fields of social
action as varied as sexuality and gender, identity and personhood, ritual, burial and deathways,
foodways, violence, and habitational space.

[113] SYMPOSIUM • RELIGIOUS AUTHORITY AND RITUAL ARCHITECTURE IN PREHISPANIC
SOUTH AMERICA
This session provides a broad comparative perspective on the development of various modalities
and practices of religious authorities and explores their associated material correlates, with a
particular emphasis on architecture. Cases from Colombia, Ecuador, Brazil, Uruguay, Peru and
Bolivia are presented, providing an important cross-section of ethnographic and archaeological
comparisons. Individual papers consider a variety of theoretical issues, such as variations in the
bases of religious authority, notions of intentionality and worldview as expressed in architecture
and other media, and the constructed environment as an arena of practice.
[114] SYMPOSIUM • "NO HISTORIES LEFT BEHIND:" THE PRACTICE OF HISTORIC PERIOD
ARCHAEOLOGY IN NON-WESTERN/MODERN CONTEXTS
By conventional definition, the scope of historical archaeology as characterized in Americanist
anthropology involves a focus on the spread of the Western world after 1492. The value in
considering this as a particular subset of archaeology is certainly a practical one. However, in a
more general sense, the practice of archaeology at sites associated with documents
unquestionably transcends the chronological and spatial boundaries imposed by this disciplinary
classification. How then, are archaeologists working in non-Western and/or non-modern contexts
where historical data is also available, meant to use existing theoretical and methodological
structures for incorporating text into their own work? Is there some form of rapprochement
between Historical Archaeology as defined above, and other text-based archaeologies? The
papers in this session will explore the use of texts and documents in archaeological research at
sites outside the traditional purvey of historical archaeology, in order to address less often
theorized but still essential uses of history in archaeology.

[116] SYMPOSIUM • NEW APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF ANDEAN URBANISM I
The last decade has witnessed exciting new research on the organization of diverse urban
systems in the ancient Andes. Despite these contributions, there is little theoretical consensus on
what constitutes the Andean city and its relation to the hinterland. In this session participants will
explore critical topics, including mechanisms of city genesis; urban-rural relations; the
intersections of city and state; the sociospatial dimensions of city life; and variations in urban
landscapes, ideologies, and political economies in different regions of the Andes. Ultimately, the
papers are intended to advance our theoretical understanding of the Andean city and prehistoric
urbanism more generally.

archaeologists to identify the ecological and social conditions under which human land use
transforms ecosystems. Through investigations of the semidesert grassland and 14th century
prehistoric community situated within Agua Fria National Monument, prehistoric demographic,
ceramic, and agricultural field data have been collected that allow us to begin reconstructing the
nature and intensity of prehistoric human occupation in this area, and to assess the conditions
that influenced the distribution of agricultural activities. Modern-day vegetation data document
the nature and extent of the ecological legacies of these practices.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT
The Programme for Belize Archaeological Project (PfBAP) has maintained a long-term research
interest since 1992 in northwestern Belize. The PfBAP serves as an umbrella institution for
multiple projects. Investigations reflect the varied research interests operating under the umbrella
and range from small settlement to major center studies that incorporate settlement surveys and
special detailed mapping in a region of approximately 260,000 acres. Research interests include
aspects of resource specialization, identity, representation, autonomous authority, and material
culture components. These interests are ultimately pursued with the intent to eventually see
social institutions of Maya civilization at the regional level.
[121] SYMPOSIUM • A SYMMETRICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by The MetaMedia Lab at Stanford and The Stanford Humanities Lab)
With few exceptions archaeology under-theorized its relationship to the material past prior to
Clarke's "loss of innocence." Subsequently, a burgeoning "theory literature" has attempted to
systematize the relations between human behaviour and material culture. We argue that the
resultant "turns" or diatribe characterizing recent archaeological thinking derives from the shared,
humanist presupposition of a radical division between people and things. In accentuating links
and crossovers with technoscience studies and empirical philosophy, this session seeks to re-
characterize archaeology's unique role in studying mixtures of humans (behaviour) and material
things. Such a "symmetry" of people-things forefronts archaeology in an inclusive 'ecology' of
"naturecultures."
[122] SYMPOSIUM • MORE THAN THINGS OR WORDS ALONE: THE INTEGRATION OF DOCUMENTARY
AND M ATERIAL RECORDS IN THE HISTORIC ARCHAEOLOGY OF LATIN AMERICA
The convergence of both textual and material data is a critical issue in historic archaeology.
Many approaches have been developed and discussed in North America, but little explicit
discussion has taken place on the integration of these data sets in the growing field of Latin
American historic archaeology. Given the distinctive nature of both documentary and
archaeological evidence in Latin America, there are many approaches - both theoretical and
methodological -that can be undertaken to create a more informed anthropological
understanding of the past. Scholars examining a diversity of populations throughout Latin
America will discuss their approaches to this primary issue.

(Sponsored by SAA Indigenous Populations Interest Group)
This session offers a range of perspectives on contemporary issues and debates surrounding
archaeology in Puerto Rico. An important aim of the session is to better understand the ways in
which archaeological and indigenous views of Puerto Rico‘s past converge, differ, and mutually
enrich each other. Thus participants include both archaeologists and Taino community
members, discussing a broad range of topics related to politics, identity, repatriation, and legal
concerns.
[124] SYMPOSIUM • PRESERVING THE WORLD'S HERITAGE RESOURCES
(Sponsored by SAA Public Education Committee)
The study and preservation of world archaeological and heritage sites has never been more
critical than today, as agencies and governments seek to develop their educational and tourism
potential without destroying them. A November 2005 working conference on preserving heritage
resources convened regional and international experts in the cultural sector—archaeologists,
lawyers, experts in development, and others—to seek new strategies for collaborations on
public policy, resource management, education, and capacity building. This session will
continue the discussion, focusing on sharing information across traditional geographic and
disciplinary boundaries and identifying specific issues and strategies for new steps to implement
solutions.

traditional views on human-land interactions. Landscape archaeology has the potential to
consider complex and subtle historical, environmental, and cultural contexts that are useful to

examine various aspects of hunter-gatherer landscapes in the Old and New worlds.
[126] SYMPOSIUM • LATIN AMERICAN ROCK ART: CONSERVATION AND RESEARCH STATUS
(Sponsored by SAA Rock Art Interest Group)
This session brings together rock art researchers from several areas within the Caribbean,
Middle and South America. Presentations on the conservation and investigative status of carved
and painted images from caves and open-air sites are detailed from such locations as the
Guatemala Highlands, Venezuela, Aruba and Puerto Rico. Topics range from the restoration of
petroglyphs at a Jamaican cave site, to new recording and dating techniques, and to
interpretations of rock art employing different methodological and theoretical approaches.
[127] FORUM • DEACCESSIONING ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS: WRESTLING WITH A
DIFFICULT ISSUE
(Sponsored by SAA Committee on Museums, Curation, and Collections)
The reality of shrinking space for collection storage and the rising costs of curation are causing
some, including federal and state agencies, to view deaccessioning as a possible panacea for
current woes. Archaeologists and curators examine the types and process of deaccessioning,
costs, issues of associated documentation, and lessons learned from inventorying existing
federal collections that can inform future deaccessioning. They also consider ways to minimize
the need for deaccessioning future collections, such as field collection practices, repository
acceptance criteria, and tiered storage standards. Active audience input is sought on these and
related issues.
[128] SYMPOSIUM • RECENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO VIOLENCE IN PREHISTORIC EUROPE FROM THE
MESOLITHIC TO THE IRON AGE
Recent finds have raised questions concerning the prevalence of warfare and violence in
prehistoric Europe. While Europe has a rich database upon which to draw for a study of both real
and symbolic violence, different languages and research traditions have tended to lead to
fragmentation of the evidence. This is in marked contrast to recent integrative work in the
Americas. The intention of this session is to bring together a group of researchers investigating
and integrating different aspects of prehistoric violence, from the Mesolithic to the Iron Age, and
including consideration of skeletal trauma, weaponry, architecture, and iconography.
[129] SYMPOSIUM • EXPLORING THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE JEMEZ PROVINCE, NEW MEXICO
In recent years, major research has been conducted on the Pueblo occupation of the Jemez
province in north-central New Mexico. This research has revealed an exceptional archaeological
record of ancestral Pueblo settlement and participation in the major cultural transformations of
the late prehispanic and early historic eras in the northern Southwest. In this session we seek to
use this research to create a synthesis of the history of Pueblo occupation in this previously
poorly understood sector of the northern Southwest, focusing on the region‘s research history,
material culture, settlement patterns, land use, external relations, and contemporary traditional
use.
[130] SYMPOSIUM • PRESERVING SIGNIFICANT ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES THROUGH
NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK DESIGNATION
National Historic Landmark (NHL) status has been conferred by the Secretary of the Interior on
fewer than 2,400 cultural properties that evoke the broad themes of American history, and only
about 300 of those properties are archaeological sites. The papers in this session describe the
history of the NHL program, since its inception in 1935, and current efforts of National Park
Service regional personnel and their preservation partners to identify and protect sites of
national significance. Specific reference will be made to recent nomination initiatives based on
current research at sites throughout the United States.

[133] SYMPOSIUM • ARTIFACT LIFE-CYCLE AND THE ORGANIZATION OF LITHIC TECHNOLOGIES
Stone tool use-life, curation, and retouch have been featured prominently in the literature on lithic
technological organization. Unfortunately, there have been few techniques established that allow
researchers to consistently measure and compare the extent to which stone tools have been
used, resharpened and reused. The symposium consists of a variety of studies that explore the
relationship between lithic artifact retouch as it relates to issues of tool curation and use-life in a
context of human organization. A mix of theoretical and methodological papers are presented
dealing with new techniques of measurement, applications of existing methods, and explorations
of theoretical issues.

[135] SYMPOSIUM • REFITTING IN MULTIPLE CONTEXTS: WHY AREN’T WE DOING MORE OF IT?
Refitting studies are increasingly used to study technological processes, economic organization
and social interactions. Refitting has become a standard analytical technique. Despite this,
refitting remains surprisingly limited to Old World archaeological circles, and continues to be
used sparsely by the North American archaeological community. This symposium will assess the
current state of refitting studies across a broad geographical and chronological range. In dealing
with a broad range of times and places in the archaeological record, these papers will provide an
avenue for building frames of reference for the meanings of various refitting patterns in a
comparative manner.
[136] WORKING GROUP • LOWLAND OLMEC HOUSEHOLDS: DOWN HOME WITH "M AW" AND "PAW"
Our working group offers a focused forum for scholars who are directly engaged in studies of
lowland Olmec households. Throughout ancient Mesoamerica, households and their labor
provided the crucial energy that fueled cultural emergence. The development of Early Formative
Olmec society represents an especially significant example of this process. Our discussions will
target basic, yet essential, information on subsistence activities, social relationships, and
domestic economies. Through in-depth comparisons of Olmec households across the ithsmanian
plain, we seek a more secure foundation for broader models of lowland Olmec socio-political
organization, ideology, emergence, and dissolution.
[137] POSTER SYMPOSIUM • USING BINFORD'S FRAMES OF REFERENCE AS A FOUNDATION FOR
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
The posters in this symposium utilize variables from the environmental and hunter-gatherer
frames of reference constructed by Binford (2001) as the foundation for archaeological research
ranging from regional to global scales of comparison. Problems include using prior knowledge
to anticipate spatial and temporal patterns of aquatic vs. plant based intensification,
examinating distributions of particular archaeological features (e.g. earth ovens and burned
rock middens) with respect to properties of environments at a regional scale, and exploring
large scale patterns in cross-cultural data (hunter gatherer mortuary practices, clothing, and
house construction; pastoralist subsistence organization) to inform archaeological research.

[144] SYMPOSIUM • HONORING OSCAR J. POLACO AND HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO LATIN
AMERICAN ZOOARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by SAA Fryxell Committee)
Latin American zooarchaeology has grown steadily during the past two decades. This growth
has depended on such individuals as the Mexican scientist Oscar J. Polaco, recipient of the
2006 Fryxell Award for Interdisciplinary Research. That development and the enhancement of
the awareness of the field underscore Polaco‘s breadth of interests and commitment. His
influence, contributions to different areas within zooarchaeology, and achievements are
reflected in the presentations through case studies and detailed site reviews covering the late
Quaternary of the Americas. They echo Polaco‘s expertise in icthyoarchaeology, taxonomy,
bone modification, and databases.
[145] SYMPOSIUM • THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CIVIC-CEREMONIAL CENTER OF TIBES, PONCE,
PUERTO RICO
This symposium presents the results of the various analyzes realized by the Proyecto
Arqueologico del Centro Ceremonial de Tibes. To date, Tibes is the earliest civic-ceremonial
center in the Greater Antilles and it seems to represent one of the earliest political and economic
centers of institutionalized stratification. The main purpose of this archaeological research is the
study of the institutionalization and internal dynamics of stratified societies in the ancient
Caribbean from the perspective of the household. The symposium includes presentations on the
excavations and the findings of the paleoethnobotanical, faunal, lithological, lithic, osteological,
bone chemistry, and regional analyses.
[146] SYMPOSIUM • ARCHAEOLOGY AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
In this session, we will explore the implications of sustainable development theory, which seeks
to balance environmental preservation, social equity, and economic development, for the
archaeologist. While archaeological resources differ in many ways from natural resources, they
too are finite, spatially bounded, and often irreplaceable. What insights does the paradigm of
sustainability offer into the ongoing problems of site management, archaeological stewardship,
research design, and the equitable use of archaeological resources? This session has been
designed to be accessible to all interested scholars, whatever their level of familiarity with
sustainability theory.
[147] SYMPOSIUM • MESOAMERICAN ICONOGRAPHY AND SYMBOLS IN ACTION: SMALL-SCALE
FIGURINES AS LARGE-SCALE SOCIAL PHENOMENA
The central goal of the session is to situate the symbolism, meanings, values, and functions of
Mesoamerican figurines within current understanding of larger social processes. While clay
figurines rarely receive the scholarly attention devoted to other iconographic works, they
represent a rich dataset from which we can examine ancient Mesoamerican social practice and
change. This wealth of conceptual information derives, in part, from figurines' unique imagery as
compared with other types of media, from their distinctive role in productive and exchange
systems, and from their significance in producing, maintaining, and negotiating social ideals and
hierarchies.
[148] SYMPOSIUM • INTEGRATING GEOSPATIAL PERSPECTIVES AND EDUCATION IN
ARCHAEOLOGY
(Sponsored by Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science (CSISS))
Many scholars, professionals, and students have begun to employ geospatial analysis in their
research; however, the teaching of geospatial thinking is still in its formative stages.
Archaeologists deal with information that is inherently spatial in nature; thus archaeology
provides an ideal setting to develop spatial thinking. This symposium focuses on geospatially
related topics including instructional tools, spatial methodologies, and teaching philosophies as
they relate to integrating geospatial perspectives in archaeology and the broader discipline of
anthropology. The session‘s goals and objectives were developed, in part, from collaborative
efforts with the Center for Spatially Integrated Social Science (CSISS) SPACE Program.

[149] SYMPOSIUM • NEW APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF ANDEAN URBANISM II
The last decade has witnessed exciting new research on the organization of diverse urban
systems in the ancient Andes. Despite these contributions, there is little theoretical consensus on
what constitutes the Andean city and its relation to the hinterland. In this session participants will
explore critical topics, including mechanisms of city genesis; urban-rural relations; the
intersections of city and state; the sociospatial dimensions of city life; and variations in urban
landscapes, ideologies, and political economies in different regions of the Andes. Ultimately, the
papers are intended to advance our theoretical understanding of the Andean city and prehistoric
urbanism more generally.

The following session assesses the archaeological fascination with empires including the
discipline‘s own genealogical investment to this particular area of study. This kind of analyses is
the more essential when the current globalization paradigm underlines the importance of
imperial modes of organization in the transnational production of identities and livelihood all
over the world, including the discipline‘s own intellectual survival. Ultimately, the session looks
to contribute to the growing studies of the political production of the past, and how these
particular political projects, studying empires, inherently contributes to modern forms of
domination and agency.

The transition from the Neolithic (ca. 6,000-4,500 BC) to the Copper Age (ca. 4,500-3,000 BC) in
the Carpathian Basin is marked by dramatic changes in social organization -from the distribution
of cultural groups across the landscape to the organization of households. Since 1998, the Körös
Regional Archaeological Project has been investigating sites in southeastern Hungary to clarify
the nature of these changes. This symposium presents the results of the multi-disciplinary
research that occurred during 2005, including extensive excavations at the Early Copper Age
settlement of Körösladány-Bikeri.
[154] FORUM • SYMMETRIES AND ASYMMETRIES IN HUNTER-GATHERER ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE
AMERICAS
Latin America and North America are two halves of one supercontinent. Both were occupied by
hunter-gatherers for millennia. North and South America have a long history of archaeological
exchanges, but one characterized mostly by southerners working at home and northerners
working in the south. As a result, the north-south traffic in ideas, collections and archaeologists
themselves is asymmetrical. This workshop will discuss both the necessity and consequences
of such one-way exchange and explore the prospects for more symmetrical collaboration in the
joint study of our hunter-gatherer archaeological records.

RECENT INVESTIGATIONS AT AGUATECA AND THE PETEXBATUN REGION
At the beginning of the Late Classic, the dynasty of Dos Pilas and Aguateca founded a new
state in the Petexbatun Region that replaced the earlier reign of Tamarindito and Arroyo de
Piedra. This political change became the focus of the recent investigations of the Aguateca
Archaeological Project. Work at Aguateca and in a regional transect that reached Tamarindito
provides new data on the transition of power from Tamarindito to Dos Pilas/Aguateca and asks
how it affected the sociopolitical organization in the Petexbatun Region.

[158] SYMPOSIUM • THE SOCIAL LIFE OF SEEDS: PALEOETHNOBOTANICAL APPROACHES TO THE
BIOGRAPHIES OF PLANTS AND PEOPLE IN ANCIENT MESOAMERICA
Paleoethnobotany has an increasing presence in Mesoamerican archaeology. Yet many
reconstructions of human-plant relationships continue to be either based on indirect sources of
data that perpetuate static social models or framed in adaptationist terms that ignore specific
social contexts. Plants were persistent nodes of action, constraint, and meaning that existed
within spatial, temporal, and social dimensions. Complex social practices, embedded in multiple
spatial and temporal scales, mediated the interactions between ancient Mesoamericans and the
plant world. This session addresses these relationships, exploring the historical and social
contingency of human-plant relationships, and contributes nuanced perspectives to
Mesoamerica‘s past.
[159] SYMPOSIUM • THE MEANING OF MASONRY: CHOICE AND PRACTICE IN THE
CONSTRUCTION OF CLASSIC MAYA BUILDINGS
Architecture at prominent Maya sites often appears in divergent styles. Although scholars have
delineated differences among these styles, few have attempted to elucidate the meanings
underlying this variation. By examining architecture at key Classic Period sites, we further
explore the significance and meaning of differing architectural styles. More specifically, we ask
whether such variation was motivated by cultural factors, such as foreign influences on native
traditions, temporal shifts in aesthetic preferences, and ―high‖ versus ―low‖ style, or practical
constraints, including the availability of raw materials and the possession of appropriate
technology. Relevant data come from throughout the Maya region.

(Sponsored by Instituto de Cultura Puertorriqueña)
Puerto Rico‘s rich cultural heritage has consistently been a subject of study and exploration for
archaeologists since the end of the nineteenth century. But while most early archaeologists
focused on the prehistory of the island, archaeologists today are exploring all facets of Puerto
Rico‘s archaeological heritage. In this session, we present a sample of the most current
research projects being carried out in Puerto Rico. These projects touch upon a variety of
topics, such as prehistoric batey sites, historical graffiti, artifact inventories and archaeological
resources management policies. The discussion will provide a representative sample of the
great variety of subjects and problems being addressed by Puerto Rico‘s archaeological
professionals and offer insights into the direction of future archaeological research in the
island.

Geophysical survey and selective excavation between the primary monuments at Tiwanaku,
Bolivia (AD 500-1000) substantially increased our understanding of distribution of ritual and
residential spaces in the urban core. The initial results confirm and expand on the extent of
period of urban redevelopment that coincides with the apogee of the influence of the polity.
Large areas of residential occupation were leveled and resurfaced to create an impressive
setting for large scale festivals. The results have impact on concepts of primary state formation
and the methodology is applicable to large complex sites worldwide.

such longstanding partnership exists between Belize and Trent University. Numerous scholars
can lay claim to a direct association to this partnership via participation in the projects that
have resulted from the Trent/Belize connection. Some of this research is highlighted here to
show the contributions that such partnerships can make towards the study of Maya
Archaeology.

systematically collected bodies of archaeological material from this region, spanning the area
from the Orinoco River in Venezuela to Puerto Rico and Cuba. In this session we bring together
scholars familiar with these collections to present the history of Caribbean archaeology at Yale
and to convey the results of research related to these collections. These papers represent
completed projects as well as ongoing research.
[167] SYMPOSIUM • A FIFTH MILLENNIUM CALENDRIC COMPLEX IN PERU
Recent findings provide data for evaluating the economic bases of the polities that erected the
first monumental architecture in the New World in Perú. Solar alignments are linked to flood
plain agriculture and fishing at a number of aceramic sites more than 4,000 years ago. Buena
Vista in the Chillón Valley is one such site; it features a calendric complex comprised of two
components, (1) an offering place alignment at a temple and (2) the gaze of a personified disk,
both of which have the same astronomical alignment simultaneously to the sun and to the
Andean water constellations.

first evidence of monumental architecture to the initial European presence. The shifts in system
organization are discussed based on a variety of evidence including settlement pattern, site
layout, exchange system, and early historic records which document system variability and
stability through time. This variety of archaeological evidence begins to document the shifting
socio-economic systems of the Norte Chico.

Africa of the later 2nd millennium AD has been long examined by scholars interested in non-
western political systems. The archaeology of African polities in this period has grown
dramatically in recent years. This session engages contemporary anthropological approaches to
complex societies, exploring factors leading to their growth and decline in Africa over the last 500
years or so. Attention is paid towards exploring variability in African complex societies of this
period, and how expanding global connections were locally negotiated. Particular attention is
granted towards understanding the political impact of the Indian Ocean trade and the Atlantic

household archaeology that offers theoretical and methodological contributions from
throughout the Americas. The participants address Formative through historical period
cultures, focusing on long-term changes in household organization, the domestic economy,
efforts to define the household unit itself, relations with ancient states, the effects of European

(Sponsored by The Board of Directors of the Society for American Archaeology)
The creation of the Colegio de Arqueólogos del Perú (as well as the legislation that established
and supports it) has been received by some professionals as a potential obstacle to the
continued development of archaeological research in Peru. For others the legislation has called
attention to problems that may have existed in the past. In either case, the regulatory changes

[178] SYMPOSIUM • QUANTITATIVE INTEGRATION OF ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL AND
ARCHAEOBOTANICAL DATA: A CONSIDERATION OF METHODS AND CASE STUDIES
Understanding subsistence archaeologically requires that we integrate as many lines of
evidence as possible. Scholars have recently emphasized the need for more holistic analyses
of food remains, and collaborative publications towards this endeavor have increased. A survey
of the literature, however, reveals few attempts to quantitatively integrate archaeobotanical and
zooarchaeological data. Given the vastly different methods for recovering/quantifying these
data, it is not surprising so few have tackled this problem. Our symposium brings together
scholars to (1) address the methodological issues of quantitatively integrating plant and animal
data, and (2) attempt integration through the presentation of relevant case studies.

Has theoretical archaeology ever developed into archaeological theory? This forum asks whether
a body of theory that is distinctively archaeological actually exists (or should, or can, exist), and
of what such theory might consist. What are the structures and practices (journals, conferences,
field investigations, etc.) that promote dialogue and theoretical convergence among
archaeologists and how are they in tension with those (university departmental structures,
specialized journals, professional organizations, national traditions, etc.) that generate
fragmentation and intellectual boundaries? The forum provides an international perspective on

Our 2005 forum agreed that ―open-knowledge‖ digital-dissemination and copyright approaches
best meet ethical obligations of preservation, access, and public-education. We continue this
discussion to explore specific frameworks to encourage greater knowledge-sharing:
(1) Data-integration is a common goal in enhancing archaeological communication. How do we
achieve data-integration when the heterogeneous nature of archaeology resists consensus
definitions and inhibits the development of enabling ―ontologies‖?
(2) Beyond data-integration, practicing archaeologists have other concerns (intellectual property
worries, reporting obligations, and career development). By exploring ―real-world‖ incentives, can
we develop and sustain services that meet individual needs while realizing open knowledge
sharing and preservation goals?

techniques and interpretive frameworks are bringing back into focus the reason we undertake
such studies: to learn about the organization of human activity in the past. Papers in this
session focus on these new methods, enhancing and challenging the interpretation of human
space use.
[186] SYMPOSIUM • SOCIAL IDENTITY OR POSTMODERN RAZZLE-DAZZLE? CRITICAL
EVALUATIONS OF IDENTITY IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Is social identity an empty buzzword, inspired by the postmodern indefinable subject, or is there
real analytical utility in it? Used enthusiastically by archaeologists in the past 10-15 years to
address gender, ethnicity, class, sexuality, life-status, community, and notions of power and
agency, the concept of social identity has matured to the point where we may revisit the question
of its interpretive power. Does identity offer new insights to our understanding of the past, or
does it merely reify the methodological individual in new ways? This session will explore these
questions through focused case studies where identity is at issue.

[188] SYMPOSIUM • THE MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES: PEOPLE,
TERRAIN, AND THE STRUCTURED USE OF SPACE
One consistent concern of archaeological analysis has been how best to deal with the spatial
dimension of material culture. Over the past two decades, the concept of landscape has
emerged as a means for comprehending the spatial component. In its ability to incorporate
observations of both a local and regional nature, this notion facilitates a holistic interpretation of
the archaeological record as we find it on and in the ground. Several participants examine
problems inherent in explaining how topography affects resource availability and social behavior.
Others approach the landscape as a medium for expressing religious and political ideologies.
[189] SYMPOSIUM • ACROSS THE LAGOON: COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION AND DEVELOPMENT AT
LAMANAI AND CHAU HIIX, BELIZE
This session examines the occupational histories and developmental trajectories of the Maya
communities of Lamanai and Chau Hiix, Belize. Located 12 kilometers apart, these sites are
distinguished from surrounding Maya communities by their lengthy occupations; they are not
only associated with early foundation dates but supported sizable populations during the
turbulent Terminal Classic (AD 800-1000) and into the ensuing Postclassic period (AD1000-
1450). The papers draw on 40 combined years of research to examine dominant patterns in
material culture at both centers. Presentations consider ceramic, lithic, architectural, mortuary,
and settlement data sets to gain insight into questions of subsistence, community development,
organization, and interaction.
[190] GENERAL SESSION • MAYA POLITICS AND REGIONAL ORGANIZATION
[191] FORUM • THE REGISTER OF PROFESSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGISTS' NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND
ETHICS FORUM
(Sponsored by Register of Professional Archaeologists)
The RPA forum will be divided into two parts. The first part will present the results of RPA‘s
needs assessment and provide an opportunity for SAA members to discuss the future direction
of RPA. Items discussed will include continuing professional education, the grievance procedure,
and professional accountability. After the needs assessment, the forum will provide SAA
members an opportunity to continue the discussion of topics debated during the Ethics Bowl.
Topics likely to be discussed include the crisis in curation, repatriation of archaeological
materials, tribal consultation, professionalism, and the commercialism of archaeology.
[192] FORUM • STEPPING OUT: CONTEMPORARY RELEVANCE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Archaeologists explore transformations and periods of stability at temporal scales unavailable in
the contemporary world. We gain insights about society, ideology, practice, process, and ecology
not accessible from present observations. Yet contemporary policy makers and specialists in
various fields make assumptions without benefit of the knowledge built from archaeological
research. So what do archaeologists have to offer toward addressing contemporary issues? How
can we inform ideas about conflict, environmental change, urban decay, and crises of identity?
We will focus on the contribution of archaeological knowledge to contemporary issues with an
active discussion between panelists and audience.

[193] SYMPOSIUM • SOCIAL COMPLEXITY IN MICHOACAN: TARASCAN STATE FORMATION
Though traditionally marginalized from Mesoamerican studies, west Mexican archaeology,
particularly work in Michoacan, has come of age in providing a variety of research opportunities.
Notably, the Late Postclassic Tarascan state provides both an entree to the issues of
understanding the emergence and maturation of social complexity and also a suitable
comparative case to the better-known models drawn from the Aztec and Maya in central and
southeastern Mesoamerica. In examining the current state of research in Pre-Tarascan and
Tarascan studies, this symposium adds to the understanding of the emergence and maturation
of complex social institutions within the larger Mesoamerican context.
[194] GENERAL SESSION • THEORY AND METHOD IN THE STUDY OF DIET AND HUMAN ADAPTATION
[195] SYMPOSIUM • SIGNALING THEORY IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Archaeologists have long been fascinated by artifacts at many scales whose creation and use
embody investment beyond their practical utility. Signaling theory integrates ideas from
economics, sociology, anthropology, and biology in explicit models of the signaling strategies
responsible for these phenomena, invented and shared by individuals and groups in response
to the shifting historical contexts in which they lived. Our papers show how signaling theory can
help archaeologists tease apart the historical dynamics behind extravagant artifacts and
assemblages in diverse contexts, ranging from archaic foragers to formative agriculturalists to
enslaved plantation workers.
[196] SYMPOSIUM • ADVANCES IN ROCK ART METHODOLOGIES
The increased pace of rock art research in recent years has led to advances in rock art
methodologies. This symposium will focus on advances in a wide range of rock art research
methods. Recent research has included dating methods, statistical techniques, landscape
analyses, use of GIS, experimental studies, ethnographic investigations, conservation issues,
and other methodologies. This symposium will discuss and demonstrate present methods and
suggest research for the future.
[197] ELECTRONIC SYMPOSIUM • CORE REDUCTION, HAÎNE OPÉRATOIRE, AND OTHER
METHODS: THE EPISTEMOLOGIES OF DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO LITHIC ANALYSIS
Lithic analysis is an increasingly multinational endeavor conducted by researchers with different
cultural and disciplinary backgrounds. The debate between proponents of the core reduction
sequence and chaîne opératoire approaches has shown that there is a mutual lack of
understanding on many fronts. Yet lithic analysis cannot be pigeon-holed into these two types
alone. This electronic symposium is designed to provide a venue for discussing the multiple
epistemologies, goals, and methods advocated by different practitioners. It is hoped that this
dialogue will help clarify the method, theory, and social context of international lithic analysis.

[199] SYMPOSIUM • LOCAL ACTION IN GLOBAL CONTEXT: ADAPTING TO THE HOLOCENE IN IBERIA
The transition from Pleistocene to Holocene remodeled the world in ways strikingly similar to
those noted by the frameworks convention for the Kyoto Protocol. The Iberian Peninsula is a
natural laboratory for understanding these processes. From demographic shifts in the
Cantabrian refugium to relative constancy in the Mediterranean region, it is a crossroads where
widespread European influences overlapped distinctive Iberian traditions. The introduction of
agriculture further diversified the patchwork of subsistence strategies. Adaptation to the
Holocene in Iberia forms a baseline for understanding the social and economic dynamics of
local human response to global climate change.

[202] SYMPOSIUM • THE CENTRAL AMAZON PROJECT: REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE HEART
OF THE AMAZON
The Central Amazon project started in 1995 as a joint effort of Brazilian and North American
archaeologists with the goal of testing hypotheses on the chronology, political organization and
the emergence of social complexity among populations settled along the floodplains of the
Amazon before the onset of European colonization. This symposium presents the results on
chronology, settlement and community patterns obtained by the project. The data shows that the
occupation of the Central Amazon was discontinuous, being characterized by hiatuses correlated
to climatic changes during the mid-Holocene, as well as cycles of political centralization and
decentralization later on.

[205] SYMPOSIUM • ENDURING MOTIVES: RELIGIOUS TRADITIONS OF THE AMERICAS
Whether viewed as the tethering aspect of habitus or the descent side of Darwinian descent with
modification, the concept of tradition plays a basic role in historical sciences. This symposium
focuses on long-lived American religious traditions, often regarded as the classical locus of
persistence. Emphasis is placed on mnemonic devices and practices including landscape and
niche construction, motifs inscribed at the scale of artifact and monument, iconography intimating
deep-seated habits and notions of embodiment, the topoi of sky and earth as recurring reference
points, and other memory technologies that impinge upon the variable stability of religious
traditions.
[206] SYMPOSIUM • TRANSITIONS: BEYOND ORIGINS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. A
SYMPOSIUM IN HONOR OF T. DOUGLAS PRICE
Beginning when most archaeologists focused on "origins" research, Doug Price's career
characteristically has highlighted transitions, and over three subsequent decades has intrigued,
influenced, and inspired us. Price's colleagues and friends, comprising peers, collaborators, and
former students, honor his contribution in global perspective, following recurrent themes in his
work -- transitions and dynamic transformative processes. Papers explore method and theory
surrounding transitions into social complexity and inequality, in human conceptualization of
identity and place, from foraging to farming, and coinciding with the spread of agriculture, as well
as the development of new laboratory methods with which to study them.
[207] SYMPOSIUM • UNDERSTANDING THE ORIGINS OF MONUMENTALITY IN PREHISPANIC LATIN
AMERICA
An analysis of monumentality is ultimately a study of labor, its mobilization as well as the
longer-term spiritual awe and political organization that can be generated by such undertakings.
The large pyramids and impressive monuments that generate attention in the nuclear zones of
Mesoamerica and the Andes thus have profound implications for studying the emergence of
political organization in the New World. In this session, comparative and contrastive patterns of
early monumental construction projects in Mesoamerica and the Andean area are discussed to
illuminate the range of ways that monumentality can function in emergent of complex societies.
[208] SYMPOSIUM • CAMBIANDO EL PASADO: UNA REVALORACIÓN DEL PERIODO PRECLÁSICO EN LAS
TIERRAS BAJAS M AYAS
De acuerdo con la información recopilada como producto de las investigaciones arqueológicas
realizadas desde finales del siglo XX en las Tierras Bajas Mayas, la última mitad del periodo
Preclásico tiene que ser revalorado como el momento donde las estructuras de poder y la
ideología de la cultura maya ya se encuentran plenamente consolidadas. Como resultado de lo
anterior, la visión que se tenía sobre este periodo como el momento en que surge la cultura
maya, debe ser replanteado mas bien como una parte integral del periodo Clásico maya.

the history of Copan from the Early Preclassic through the Late Classic, exploring issues of
landscape transformation, the rise of the Main Group, the importance of ballcourts, Copan's
relationship to other Maya communities, and the art and material culture of the site. Scholars
will discuss the conservation of Honduras' cultural legacy and effective methods to
communicate the site's history to the public.
[211] SYMPOSIUM • IN THE WAKE OF THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF DEATH: TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER
The publication of The Archaeology of Death was a milestone in the growth of mortuary studies
in the 1970s and 1980s. As an attempt to refocus archaeologists' attention upon the meaning
and expression of cultural reaction to death the book highlighted the social and symbolic
interrelations between material culture and mortuary behaviors. Its effects were wide-ranging,
providing impetus for subsequent generations of scholars to explore mortuary studies creatively.
Authors in this session 1) discuss the importance of the volume to mortuary studies and 2) more
broadly consider the role of mortuary studies in current archaeological theory and practice.
[212] SYMPOSIUM • NEW PERSPECTIVES IN ANDEAN HOUSEHOLD ARCHAEOLOGY
This collection of papers will focus on a nearly untapped resource for understanding social
processes in the Andean past, houses. In this symposium authors will address the
archaeological remains of residential areas, emphasizing theoretical perspectives and new
methodologies, and incorporate data from domestic contexts into models of social action and
cultural processes. Ranging from the effects of depositional processes on the potential
interpretations of household data to using the organization of activities in residential space to
examine elements of identity, the participants forge new approaches to understanding the social,
economic, and political organization of ancient Andean societies through investigating
archaeological households.

Over the past decade many professionals have declared that traditional graduate programs in
anthropology are not adequately training the next generation of professionals. The MATRIX
project has been an overwhelming success in providing a new direction for undergraduate
education. It has become apparent that we also need to reinforce this direction for the
graduate curriculum. In this forum, graduate students, new graduates, and established
professionals will discuss their experiences and vision for the graduate curriculum in the

[215] SYMPOSIUM • ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO RECONSTRUCTING CULTURAL
SYSTEMS
This session will bring together scholars engaged in innovative zooarchaeological research in
the Old World that focuses on developing new ways to examine topics such as seasonality,
intensity of animal exploitation, systems of mobility and meat redistribution, inter-regional
exchange, ideological systems, occupational specialization, and social ranking. This session
provides a valuable representation of the current state of the field in terms of the questions
being investigated and the methods used to address them and serves to emphasize the
ultimate value of zooarchaeology in the reconstruction of cultural systems in periods ranging
from the Paleolithic to the Bronze Age.
[216] SYMPOSIUM • LONG-TERM CULTURE CHANGE AND CONTINUITIES IN POST-CONQUEST
MESOAMERICA
The Spanish colonization of Mesoamerica had lasting effects on indigenous cultures, yet many
preserved continuities. This session contains recent research on cultural continuity and change
in the growing field of Mesoamerican historical archaeology. Documents, cultural geography,
and archaeology enable the panelists to examine agency, social organization, subsistence, and
settlements. Papers treat different regions and periods to elucidate the disparate reactions to
culture contact over the long term (ca. 1500-1900 CE). However, we also illustrate similarities in
native responses to colonialism across time and space. The focus is on change and continuities
in indigenous economies, artifacts, households, and politics.

subsistence practice/strategies, organization of lithic technology, sourcing of lithic materials,
and geochronology and dating. The papers present research from the Southeast, Southern
Plains, Central Plains, Northwestern Plains, and Rocky Mountain regions of North America.

ANDEAN CERAMICS: CURRENT RESEARCH AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS
Provenance investigations of pottery by chemical and mineralogical techniques have proven to
be valuable avenues of research for better understanding broad anthropological topics in Andean
prehistory. Papers in this session demonstrate that chemical and/or mineralogical analyses of
ceramics are essential, and perhaps underexplored approaches for understanding economic and
sociopolitical transformations that occurred in Andean prehistory. Specifically, papers in this
session illuminate aspects of social inequality, power, elite and non-elite consumption, statecraft,
ethnicity, exchange, production, and technology—all through the lens of provenance
investigations.
[220] SYMPOSIUM • LANDSCAPES OF INTENSIFICATION
The intensification of agricultural production is one of the most promising directions for landscape
archaeology. Human communities transform their surroundings in many ways, but economic
undertakings often involve dramatic changes that can retain a high degree of archaeological
visibility though time. This session will explore the material manifestations of intensification and
the ways archaeologists use them to reconstruct the economic, social, and political forces that
produced, and were reproduced, by them. The session will be composed of a geographically and
methodologically diverse group of case studies, ranging from Mesoamerican terracing to
Mesopotamian manuring.
[221] SYMPOSIUM • THE M AYA AND THE TOLTECS: REINTERPRETING EARLY POSTCLASSIC
INTERACTION
The nature of interaction between the Maya and Toltecs has been a central question of
Mesoamerican archaeology for decades. For many, the Early Postclassic is defined only by Tula
and Chichen Itza. Reassessments of the chronologies of both cities imply that interaction must
be interpreted within a framework that also includes Xochicalco, Cacaxtla, El Tajin, and La
Quemada, other important hubs in the 9th through 11th century international network. This
session re-examines the "Early Postclassic" from this broader perspective, with the goal of
moving beyond unidirectional models of exchange and towards', a more comprehensive
understanding of the Mesoamerican network society.

information management can help us get there.
[226] SYMPOSIUM • THEORETICAL APPROACHES TO THE INTERPRETATION OF FLAKED STONE
ASSEMBLAGES
Analysts frequently approach the explanation of flaked stone assemblages with questions of
technology. Where are raw stone resources located and what are the properties of such
resources? What kinds of tools were produced? What was the technique used? What are the
morphological characteristics that will allow us to define tools and distinguish time periods? While
these questions are significant, have broad relevance in archaeological research, and are all
inherently grounded in theory, they generally avoid the ―why‖ questions that we seek to answer
as anthropologists. Because flaked stone artifacts are an enduring and extensive source of
archaeological information, analyses and interpretation of these assemblages contribute
extensively to our understanding of past humans. This symposium focuses on the use of
explicitly theoretical constructs employed in conjunction with flaked stone analyses to explore the
human past.
[227] SYMPOSIUM • SMUGGLING IN THE ATLANTIC WORLD
In the last 30 years, historians and archaeologists have done much to document the economy
of the Atlantic 'world system' between the 16th and 19th centuries. The dominant outlines of
this system were in-filled with smaller circuits of trade, many of them technically illegal
according to mercantilist law and wartime trade embargoes. However, these circuits have
received little scholarly attention. Archaeology may provide the best (or only) evidence for
these important undercurrents that shaped colonial societies and fomented political
movements. This symposium aims to explore the methodological and theoretical issues raised
by the archaeology of smuggling.

Contra trends in some areas, in SE Mesoamerica archaeologists have carried out wide ranging
projects investigating both large centers and the smaller/rural/secondary centers surrounding
these metropolitan sites. We suggest these smaller nodes be called agrestic centers, a term
that evokes their more rural locations and likely involvement in agriculture without conjuring up
negative connotations. Our papers focus on agrestic centers and the complex socio political
landscapes in which they rest. Themes include spatial structures of sites and regions, site and
region based activities, particularly craft working, and socio political integration among agrestic
centers and even smaller settlements.

state political economy. Examples of domestic structures in capitals from Central Mexico, the
Oaxaca valleys, and the Maya area in Mesoamerica throughout the Classic and Postclassic, as
well as from the Bolivian high plateau, the Peruvian southern sierra and northern coast will be
reviewed.

[240] SYMPOSIUM • CASE STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE ARCHAEOLOGY
Archaeology contributes most significantly to the study of people and society by ranging broadly
through time and space. Yet our studies tend to concentrate within limited geographies and
periods. Comparisons across cultures often have been cursory, due to lack of rigorous and
replicable methods and to our own specializations leaving us insufficiently familiar with the full
contexts of the "other" cases to which we try to compare our own data. The purpose of this
symposium is to bring together explicitly comparative cases into a single forum, towards a
discussion of cross-cultural archaeology as an emerging and critical area of expertise.
[241] SYMPOSIUM • PERSPECTIVES ON SYMBOLISM FROM THE NORTHEAST AND MIDWEST
A broad spectrum of papers by archaeologists, anthropologists and First Nation members

throughout Northeastern and Midwestern North America. Graphic representations and symbolic
expressions on bones, shells, ceramics, stones, trees and wooden poles are explored, as are
diverse cultural beliefs about turtles, rattlesnakes and other creatures (both real and
mythological). A theme emerging from these papers is that certain shared symbolic beliefs,
graphic representations and ceremonial uses of material culture not only have considerable
antiquity but cross-cut several linguistic and cultural boundaries.

recovered evidence supporting the 1492 Columbus landfall at the Long Bay site, both on San
Salvador island. Current research in the Bahamas and on San Salvador owes a great deal to
Charlie Hoffman's early efforts and scientific contributions. The papers in this session run the
gamut from prehistoric to historic archaeology and from theoretical approaches to the results of

Archaeological interpretation from plowzone assemblages and surface collections share crucial
groundwork laid in the 1970s and 80s that correlated plowed and/or surface distributions to a
more whole archaeological record. The papers in this session use plowed or surface
assemblages to go past a discussion of methods to the cultural interpretations they allow. The
session as a whole provides examples of plowzone and surface studies in action, where they
have been successful at eliciting accounts of human behavior in the past.

Recent investigations at the site of Chawak But‘o‘ob on the Rio Bravo Escarpment in the Rio
Bravo Conservation and Management Area of Northwestern Belize have revealed an
architecturally complex, but humble wetland community characterized by densely distributed
commoner housing, extensive hydrological architecture, and dry-slope residential terracing. This
symposium considers the site‘s architecture, landscape modifications, artifacts, and soils as

[51] Local Histories and Large-Scale Patterns on the South Coast of Peru
During the Late Intermediate Period several independent polities developed with a shared
cultural tradition along the southern coast of Peru. Large-scale patterns during this time stemmed
from the expansion and collapse of Middle Horizon states as well as local histories. The
combination of external and internal influences resulted in new interactions, migrations, and
exchange systems that connected people in different ways than previously. Evidence from the
Nasca region and the adjacent highlands of Lucanas is considered, in addition to comparative
information from other groups, to evaluate how local trajectories coincided with macro-regional
patterns to create a new sociopolitical landscape.

[63] Space and Place in Early Historic South India: Using GIS to Model Regional Dynamics

The development of a spatial database for the central Malabar Coast in Kerala, India, is making
possible new interpretations about the impact of external trade links on emerging complexity in
southwestern India. This paper presents the potential of using GIS to synthesize hitherto
dispersed data sources – ranging from existing and new survey data, historical and
topographical maps, and satellite imagery – to re-assess the impact of inter-regional Indian
Ocean trade networks on local settlement patterns and exchange systems.

[43] Residential Stability and Mobility in Prehistoric Central Ohio: The Millwood Rockshelter
     (33KN395) in Knox County
Excavation of the Millwood Rockshelter in the Kokosing River drainage of Knox County in
central Ohio has revealed a large assemblage of lithics and Late Woodland grit-tempered
cord-marked potsherds. Petrographic analysis of the potsherds revealed that the temper is
igneous in origin, yet no igneous source lies anywhere nearby. The lithics reveal long-term,
sporadic occupation, from the Early Archaic to the Late Prehistoric. These discoveries raise
fundamental questions concerning the degree of residential mobility. We are beginning to
discern a settlement pattern in which Woodland peoples moved regularly among a variety of
valley sites, despite the advent of horticulture.

[107] MAÍS Southwest: Identifying and Describing Landraces of Indigenous Maize of the
      Southwestern United States
For over three millennia, maize (Zea mays L.) has been an important crop in the Southwestern
United States. Historic indigenous maize grown in Mexico and many other New World countries
has been well reported, but not in the United States. To fill this information gap, 123 maize
accessions grown from USDA seed collected in the 20th century from Native Americans across
the southwestern United States have been described (growth and ear traits) and grouped into
landraces. Grain yield and temperature requirements for maturation will inform archaeological
models, and morphological traits of greatest use for distinguishing landraces will benefit
archaeobotanists.

[31] Memory of a Mutable Landscape: Roads and Archaeology at Poplar Forest
Over 200 years, private roads and paths evolved in response to the needs of Thomas Jefferson‘s
slave-holding plantation Poplar Forest. Tenant farming and use as a summer retreat created
further changes to this network. Three of these roads are placed within a problematized
landscape of documents, oral histories, archaeology and public interpretation. Tensions between
document, oral history, research and interpretation inform the archaeology of contingent and
mutable landscapes. Archaeology and public interpretation is often played out within this space
between realized place as artifact and the transformative power of memory.

[242] Landscape Change and Human Settlement in the Upper Tensas Basin,
      Northeastern Louisiana
Landscape evolution may determine the way humans utilize their environment, from influencing
settlement patterns to constraining cultural change. This is particularly true in rapidly-changing
alluvial environments. The Tensas Basin of the Lower Mississippi Valley contains a number of
archaeological sites, important due to their antiquity as well as their size and complexity. A
sequence of river avulsions, meander shifts, and crevasse splay events after 5500 cal. BP have
been documented using core sediment analyses, soil maps and digital elevation models. The
resulting environmental destabilization and settlement discontinuity are implicated in significant
cultural changes at the end of the Archaic period.

[167] Sun and Constellation Calendars in the Late Preceramic Period of Perú
Besides declination, change in magnetic north since a map was made, two factors are
considered when analyzing astronomical alignments: (1) azimuth angle of sunrise/sunset during
the period under study; (2) position of the sun with respect to constellations at that time. The
solstice sunrise/sunset azimuth is determined by observer‘s latitude and obliquity of the ecliptic,
which oscillates with time, thus changing the solstice azimuth. The position of the sun with
respect to the constellations at the solstice varies over time with the precession of the earth‘s
axis. Our evaluations of Late Preceramic site alignments are based on these criteria.

[152] Regional Stable Isotopic Value Variability in West-Central/North Patagonia (Argentina)
The central-western region of Argentina is thought to be the southern boundary of prehispanic
maize agriculture while its neighbor region of North Patagonia is assumed to be populated by
hunter-gatherers that never ate maize. In order to explore this variability, we present stable
carbon and nitrogen isotope data from San Juan, Mendoza and Neuquén (Argentina). The
isotopic information includes late Holocene human bone collagen and apatite and tooth
enamel samples, and animal and plant food resources, from several environmental zones.
With this information we discuss the role of maize and its temporal and spatial variability in
this broad region.

[83] Paleoindians, Perishable Artifacts, and Dying Paradigms Redux
Despite two decades of research suggesting that the ―man in furs with stone-tipped spear

Indeed, there have even been recent efforts to revivify it. This paper addresses the deep
antiquity, diversity, and ubiquity of non-durable artifacts in the Paleoindian technological
inventory and behavioral repertoire in North and South America as well as the implications of
these data for new models of Paleoindian lifeways. Not surprisingly, when viewed through a
―perishable prism,‖ the roles of females, the old and the young of both sexes, are brought into
sharp relief.

Animals are frequently depicted on artifacts recovered from precontact Native American sites
throughout the Americas. However, it is often difficult to determine what these animal effigies
meant to the peoples who made them. In this paper, I will present a new, interdisciplinary method

analogy, and finally interpretation. I will demonstrate how the method works by using it to

[117] Mesoamerican Communicating Objects: Their Function and Influence on Maya
       Worldview Before, During, and After Spanish Contact
This paper analyzes archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethnographic data to analyze
Mesoamerican communicating icons and their function in ancestor veneration practice. Different
Mesoamerican social groups incorporated various cultural aspects of their trading partners,
alliances, and even enemies, with a resulting hybrid of similarities that define what we today call
Mesoamerican culture. Religion is of course part of this worldview and what becomes apparent
is that the Maya had a hybrid culture centuries before the arrival of the Spanish. Contact period
Iberian Catholicism was no different being syncretically composed of Christian, Visigothic,
Muslim, Roman, and other worldviews that continue to this day.

[78] At the Plains Village Threshold: Settlement Organization and Architecture at Menoken
     Village NHL, North Dakota
Menoken, a terminal Late Woodland settlement (~AD 1200) in central North Dakota, once
contained 30+ houses surrounded by a bastioned palisade and ditch. Two distinct, earth-
covered, oval house types occur: (1) semisubterranean with an interior entry ramp, and (2) at the
surface with many wall posts. Entrances face northeast, southwest, and southeast. Single
excavated examples of surface and pit houses do not differ in season of use or overall function.
The fortified settlement plan is akin to that in contemporaneous Initial Middle Missouri villages,
while elements of both house types occur in the highly standardized IMM and EMM house forms.

[210] The Aesthetics of Animism in Eighth-Century Maya Temple Design
The project to conserve, analyze, and re-present the facades of Temple 22 is a cumulative one,
spanning the efforts of scholars over several centuries. This paper places Temple 22 within the
history of Maya architectural design by offering new insight into its eighth-century appearance.
Employing performance theory and phenomenology, this paper proposes that Temple 22's
architects designed it to serve a particular discourse of dynastic power by engaging the
experiential aesthetics of Maya religion. Temple 22 was successful in that the ancient Maya
sought both to quote and conserve it; continued conservation efforts are necessary still today.

[52] Ceramic Production and Exchange among Enslaved Africans on St. Kitts, West Indies
Archaeological investigations at the Brimstone Hill Fortress National Park on St. Kitts have
recovered 665 Afro-Caribbean ware sherds dating 1790-1850. This pottery was most likely made
on St. Kitts by enslaved Africans. Recent analysis of the sherds and clay sourcing studies are
aimed at understanding the context of ceramic production and trade by enslaved Africans.
Analysis shows that many sherds resemble pottery from nearby islands, but have characteristics
making them distinctly Kittian. This indicates that enslaved Africans engaged in patterns of
production and trade with nearby islands that has not been previously recognized.

Investigations into Classic Maya science reveal a cosmology that does not seem to be built on

In this paper, I explore the logical ramifications of interpreting Maya Creation through a model of
rationality that takes oracles and non-mechanical causality into account. To assist in filling the
void, I turn to indigenous notions of "power" for a translation of the term k‘uh. This suggests a re-
interpretation of the relationships amongst Classic Maya peoples and between people and their
"natural" world.

[32] Behavioral Complexity in Projectile Technology during the MSA/LSA Transition in East

The end of the Middle Stone Age is marked by higher frequencies of bone tools, ornaments,
pigments and other symbolic artifacts and exotic lithic raw materials, and decreased stone tool
size. Transitional lithic assemblages often contain both backed microlithic blades and small
unifacial and bifacial points. Small points may have been lighter, thinner projectile tips, possibly
for arrows. Backed microliths, if hafted obliquely back-to-back in pairs, are better arrow points;
they provide sharper edges and lack the thick cross-section and butt of faceted platform flakes.
Behaviorally complex individuals may have manufactured both types of artifacts in different
circumstances.

[15] Recognizing the Broader Dimensions of Religious/Ritual Artifacts
Some artifacts refer to religious arenas through use of consciously constructed symbol-systems
recognized by a past social group. Simultaneously, such artifacts represent the conditions of
the lived ―reality‖ of the group, concerning issues of environment, access, contact, etc. By
recognizing that a religious artifact thus reflects the perceived relation of symbolic and empirical
spheres, the archaeologist can garner information concerning both the dynamic relationship of
different component elements of the group‘s environment, and knowledge of how specifically
religious phenomena were positioned throughout these broader sociocultural parameters. I will
use my research concerning Minoan glyptic to illustrate these ideas.

[5] The Schuyler Flatts Burial Ground: An 18th Century African-American Cemetery near
    Albany, New York
The Schuyler Flatts Burial Ground was discovered in May 2005 during construction in the town of
Colonie, New York. Previously unrecorded, the site was determined to be an eighteenth century
African-American cemetery that was located on the grounds of a farm once owned by the
Schuylers, a prominent colonial Albany family. Bioarchaeological analysis of twelve individuals,
including seven adults and five children, will provide an opportunity to examine eighteenth
century rural African-American life within the context of the developing social and economic
landscape of a northern capital city.

[196] Rock Art Interpretation -- Making Our Reasoning Explicit for Examples Which Are Most
      Like Texts
Rock-art interpretation is controversial. Yet motifs sometimes occur in combinations favoring
particular readings. Examples include hunting scenes, multiply repeated motifs, and perhaps
tickmark records indicating when rains came. Readings also depend on ethnographic
analogies, objects depicted in rock art, and locations of rock art, all external to texts
themselves. Other tools include distributions across time and space, and evidence for
variation, equivalences and distinctions, in the most favorable cases linking rock art styles with
present-day peoples or with peoples recognizable archaeologically. By making our reasoning
explicit, we can place interpretation on a firmer footing. This promotes public support for
preservation.

To better understand the effects of globalization on the built environment, this paper investigates
how the growing global economy of the 20th century has affected the architecture in the Maya
community of Silvituc, Campeche, Mexico. Specifically, it addresses the question of whether
alterations in structure design and composition correlate to changes in household production and
age of structure. This will contribute to the study of how changes in household occupation,
possibly the result of world systems pressures, may be reflected in the archeological record both
past and present.

[133] Projectile Point Provisioning Strategies and Human Land Use
The classification of projectile points in North America often emphasizes the shape and size of
the haft element and not the blade element. Emphasis on the haft element in classification is an
advisable strategy since the blade element morphology and size tends to change during the
use life of the specimen. This is exactly why the characteristics of projectile point blade
elements such as retouch amount, size and shape are useful for inferring characteristics of
technological organization. Variability in retouch amount and location on projectile point blade
elements is shown to be directly associated with prehistoric hunter-gatherer land use patterns.

     Capital of the Inca Empire
The recovery of burials from the Cuzco site of Sacsayhuaman provides the opportunity to
understand the life histories and mortuary treatment of elite individuals in the Inca Empire. The
analysis of 42 burials has revealed distinct patterns in burial treatment, demography,
paleopathology, and cranial vault modification. A comparison between Sacsayhuaman and
Chokepukio, a site located 35 km outside the city of Cuzco, shows significant variation in burial
practices and frequencies of specific diseases. This analysis elucidates the differences between
the elite sector living in Cuzco and the individuals under their control, suggesting that social
stratification had direct impacts on health.

This paper discusses the results of an analysis of more than 29,000 lithic artifacts collected in

The data on obsidian artifacts indicate a skewed distribution, suggesting that the rulers of
Aguateca had the most access to obsidian in the city while the procurement and distribution of
obsidian polyhedral cores may have been administered by the royal court of the Aguateca
dynasty as part of its political economy. The data from Aguateca are consonant with the
interpretation of Mesoamerican obsidian core-blade technology under elite control.

[201] The Political Economy of Late Bronze Age Mycenaean Greece: Corporate or Network

Mycenaean culture is generally considered a complex society, but a cross-cultural approach
introduces new interpretations and evolutionary patterns indicative of broader cultural
processes. Using the Dual-Processual Theory (Blanton et al., 1996), this paper examines
societal evolution in Late Bronze Age Greece and suggests that administrative centers were
located at trade network nodes where both archaeological and textual evidence suggest that
community leaders used the network strategy to organize the political economy. Two case
studies, the administrative centers at Pylos and Thebes, illustrate the applicability of the model
for explaining Mycenaean cultural change and help formulate a number of research questions.

The Late Intermediate Period is traditionally considered a time of regional differentiation rather
than a horizon. However, this designation obscures several large-scale patterns which existed
even in the absence of umbrella political or religious institutions: defensive settlement design,
political fragmentation and limited reconsolidation, the development of local ethnic identities,
chulpa burial and ancestor worship, relatively small settlement sizes, etc. This paper opens the
session by briefly exploring some possible explanations - previous state collapse, climate
change, and migration – and the archaeological implications and contradictions they raise.

indicating local adherence to a perceived pan-Celtic tradition. The concept of a culturally
unified "Celtic people" has, however, been increasingly questioned in recent years and it is
clear that special treatment of the head was by no means restricted to any particular cultural
area. Drawing on anthropological studies of more recent societies it is possible to begin a
reassessment of the evidence for Iron Age head-hunting in Europe.

Excavations at Fort Center in the 1960s recovered chert artifacts from several contexts. These

perform utilitarian tasks. Reanalysis indicates that all of the chert was imported from outcrops
well to the north and that much of it arrived as finished bifaces or small cobbles. While there is
little evidence for on-site production of bifaces, there is convincing evidence for the making of
flake tools and microliths. Mortuary associations of thermally altered Archaic-period projectile
points suggest they were destined for use in the ideotechnic realm.

[203] Characterization of Local Lithic Toolstone Variability from a Quarry Neighboring the
      Eastern Llano Estacado: Recent Research at PLK-Locality 1
Almost 25 years since the first systematic examination of local lithic resources for the Llano
Estacado, relatively few quarries have been investigated. Fieldwork at PLK-Locality 1, an
extensive quarry for Ogallala Formation gravels, has provided an opportunity to add additional
qualitative data to the earlier surveys. The site has been sampled systematically in an effort to
record the variability in lithic source material, technology, and geomorphic processes. The results
are significant for the interpretation of lithic technology at this location and for the wider
perspective of local lithic materials recovered at archaeological sites across the adjacent Llano
Estacado.

[209] 75 Years of Photography on the Southern High Plains: The Importance of Images in
      Contextualizing Regional Archaeology
Photography is well established as a vital archaeological tool. Often, after completion of a
project, the photographs are not treated with the same respect as the accompanying artifacts.
Photographs provide much historical and contextual information especially valuable in long-
term regional investigations. The Yellowhouse System is a research program that has
benefitted extensively from photographic documentation. From the beginning of its utilization
as a public park system, through the earliest archaeological excavations, to the currently
ongoing research, photography provides valuable comparative perspectives. Care should be
taken to protect, store, and utilize photographic evidence in a manner befitting its importance.

[111] The Corporeal Politics of Being in the Neolithic
Between 6500-3500 cal. BC, southeast European people made, handled, and threw away
anthropomorphic figurines. Figurines fill sites, museums and the literature, though the latter
struggles with their meaning. This paper examines subtle processes that solidified fluid notions of
being within Neolithic villages. Figurine homogeneity suggests emergent corporeal registers that
stimulated people‘s thinking about being human and about how to understand corporeal
similarities and differences. Stereotypes, spectation, and forced inference are all at play as are
debates about body-parts and body-image construction. Relevance is for European prehistory
and other regions and periods in which the human form is represented in three-dimensions.

[80] Soil Chemical Analysis of Ancient Maya Activities at Trinidad de Nosotros, Guatemala
The ancient Maya site of Trinidad de Nosotros lies on the shores of Lake Petén Itzá in northern
Guatemala. The central location of the site suggests that marketplace and ceremonial activities
may have occurred at the site. We sampled several plazas to determine levels of phosphate and
heavy metals that may represent chemical residues of ancient human activities. Higher
phosphate levels in comparison to surrounding areas have been used to indicate areas of food
preparation and consumption. Elevated concentrations of heavy metals often indicated ritual or
workshop activities.

[239] Applied Zooarchaeology: Archaeological Freshwater Mussel Assemblages from the

Freshwater mussel populations throughout eastern North America are critically imperiled.
Examination of nearly 60 archaeological assemblages of freshwater mussels from the Upper
Mississippi River Drainage has built a more comprehensive understanding of their pre-European
geographic distribution and population dynamics, creating an important aid to conservation
efforts. Although these assemblages are biased by a number of factors, including aboriginal
collection techniques, their value to conservation biology should not be discounted. The
application of zooarchaeological knowledge to conservation issues is a growing avenue of
research that can no longer be overlooked and will ultimately become a major asset to both
fields.

[49] Huamelulpan and the Nature of the Mixtec City
Marcus (1983) identifies multiple nuclei cities among the variant forms of Mesoamerican
urbanism. Huamelulpan and other Formative Mixteca Alta cities had multiple nuclei settlement
patterns; new research on their archaeological precursors suggests how these patterns
originated. This paper views the Mixtec urbanization at several scales, from excavations in
Middle Formative barrios to survey-based comparisons of Huamelulpan and its contemporaries
in neighboring valleys. The multiple nuclei settlement pattern--that predates the Mixtec
urbanization--was a major structuring principle that continued into the Colonial period. This
generic similarity nonetheless diverges into varied forms as each specific case is examined in

[19] The Mesolithic/Neolithic Transition in the Carpathian Basin (Eastern Central Europe),
      Presenting Different Models within Similar Ecological Regions
Within the spread of Neolithic towards the inner regions of Europe, the Carpathian Basin plays a
decisive role in several aspects. One of these is the fact that it was the early LBK of Western
Hungary, formulated through the cultural and genetic mixing of local foragers and migrant
farmers which, rapidly spreading westwards, using already existing pre-Neolithic contacts,
became a basis for Central European Neolithic societies. The paper discusses two questions:
Why exclusively the Trans-Danubian LBK played a role in the Central European neolithisation?
What could be the reason of the vivid and long-lasting contacts between W-Hungary and NW-
Germany in the 6th millennium BC?

A reanalysis of tooth mark frequencies carried out by the authors shows that previous estimates
of tooth marks on the FLK Zinj assemblage were overestimated by mistaking natural
inconspicuous marks of biochemical origin for tooth marks. Cut mark frequencies and
anatomical distribution indicates that hominids had early access to fleshed carcasses that were
transported, processed and accumulated at the FLK Zinj site. Therefore, food surplus might
have been one of the characteristics in the accumulation of carcasses at this site. This
resurrects Isaac´s idea that food sharing might have been one of the stimuli generating some
early sites.

[54] Persistent Identities: Community Tradition and Political Centralization in Coastal Oaxaca
The Terminal Formative Period saw the first centralized regional polity in the lower Rio Verde

political authority, elites and commoners continued to commemorate local histories and reiterate
local identities. This paper examines how tradition and memory were employed in ritual practice
to transform inequality and extra-local authority into expressions of local community identity. I
argue that the persistence of local identities represents ongoing negotiation between elites and
commoners, as well as local and regional political formations, regarding the character of
Terminal Formative sociopolitical relations.

Lithic resource exploitation by the ancient Maya in upper northwest Belize centered on several

the Late Classic. Production localities exhibited some variation in tool forms, reduction
trajectories, and longevity of use. These variables reflect natural, cultural, and historical
influences. Demand for regional resources increased dramatically in the Late Classic due to
population pressures and decreasing long-distance imports. Diverse conservation strategies
were practiced during the Late Classic, reflecting an adaptation to increasing resource
shortages. Many resource nodes became exhausted and were eventually abandoned.

the status of an individual or family, particularly in historic euro-American populations. The
analysis of the Bulkeley Family Tomb indicates the family's lifestyle, health and nutrition and
provides information concerning mortuary custom. In America, before the mid 19th century, the

individuals who have been interred.

It goes without saying that archaeologists deplore looting of archaeological materials and

same time, however, many archaeologists are critical of essentialist and nationalist

assuming that a priori geographic and environmental features determine either the use or

can contribute to the investigation of how landscapes are both producers of socio-political
differences as well as the result of socially and culturally mediated land use.

[244] 700 Islands, 3 Analogs: Situating Bahamian Historical Archaeology in

Historians and archaeologists have often compared the Bahamas to different world areas to
contextualize their understanding of plantation and post-emancipation life. Archaeologists have
traditionally considered the Bahamas within the purview of the Caribbean, while more recently
historians have begun to consider Bermuda and the southeastern United States as useful
analogs for understanding the dynamics of plantation life and emancipation in the Bahamas. This
paper considers several key elements of plantation and post plantation life in the Bahamas
(environment, economy, social dynamics) and begins to make some suggestions of how three
different broad comparative contexts (Bermuda, Southeastern US, and the Caribbean) can help

However, the economic organization of outlying ―hinterlands‖ is rarely examined and theorized

scale environmental change in the Preclassic and ditching and other intensive land uses around

[9] Pacific Coastal Guatemela Archaeology: A Historical Overview
This paper reviews research by period. We start summarizing the state of knowledge reported by
Shook in the Handbook of Middle American Indians (HMAI) (research through 1961). Then we
detail mentions in the 1981 HMAI Archaeology Supplement, Projects' foci between 1981 and
1989 when the Bove-Heller volume, New Frontiers in the Archaeology of the Pacific Coast of
Southern Mesoamerica, was published are reviewed. Finally, contrast in content of the first
several annual Guatemala City archaeological symposia with the last two provides some insights
into how the region is doing in moving from a "backwater" to "the mainstream."

[170] A Comparative Perspective on the Domestic Economy of Highland Bolivian Households
Changes in the domestic economy of Condor Chinoka and Jachakala households indicative of
the incipient development of inter-household wealth differences and long-term changes in the
social and economic organization of households are reconstructed through an approach
centered on the remains of household features and activities. A range of subsistence, craft
production, exchange, and ritual activities practiced by these two sites‘ residents are described
in comparative terms. This comparison allows preliminary exploration of commonalities among
Middle Horizon (ca. AD 400-800) and Late Intermediate Period (ca. AD 800-1200) occupations
of small village communities in the Bolivian highlands contemporaneous with Tiwanaku.

[92] Reconsidering Ethnographic Modernity
One Native American attitude toward archaeology can be expressed by the feeling, ―Whose
history is it anyway? Who needs archaeologists? We know our origins.‖ Can culture histories
obtained by archaeological, ethnographic, and historical studies ever be expected to have the
same supportive value as more traditional tribal histories? In the case of repatriation claims, the
burden of proof is placed upon the native communities to prove the validity of their claims. This
paper will consider how those tribal histories can have supportive value even when it seems
they must be constantly substantiated by archaeological and historical studies.

[246] Landscape and Subsistence in a Central Maya Lowlands Wetland Community
Prehispanic landscape manipulation at Chawak But‘o‘ob, in northwestern Belize took place on a
residential scale to control access and create vistas. More substantial landscape manipulation
took place across large sections of the site to provide residential space on sloping terrain and to
closely manage water and soil resources. The extent of these landscape modifications suggests
that the Maya tendency to reshape their physical environment, so evident in cities, extended to
the most unassuming sites. The symbolic aspects of landscape and hydrology are considered as
are settlement and artifactual evidence for the Prehispanic use of the adjacent flood plain for
agriculture.

Across from the entrance to the Nevada Test Site is a public landscape that has been used for

[82] The Contexts of Bioarchaeology
When Buikstra first proposed the concept of Bioarchaeology in the 1970s she emphasized that

obtained when the specific context of the burial and the biology of the individual are merged. In

proveniences but a variety of additional contexts on cultural, political, and scientific levels. It is
Buikstra‘s foundational emphasis on context that has directed this growth.

[15] Political Economy and the Routinization of Religious Movements
Max Weber defined routinization as the process by which a religious movement is
institutionalized--its charisma transferred from its original leader(s) to a stable social order. This
process is marked by the creation of new rituals and paraphernalia, and as such is financed
through the political economy. I suggest that distinct forms of social order may emerge through
routinization, depending upon the political economy that finances this process. Specifically,
political economies based on surplus production give rise to social orders distinct from
economies based on opportunistic surplus procurement. I use two religious movements from
Eastern Woodlands prehistory, Hopewell and Mississippian, to illustrate this distinction.

[235] Domestic Life at Tikal, Guatemala: Variations in Plaza Plan Reflect Ethnic
       Differences, but Variations in Size Indicate Heterarchy
The recognition of distinct patterns in various groups of domestic as well as ritual structures at
Tikal has provided a basis for developing effective research strategies for lowland Maya sites.
Each separate group arrangement, or "Plaza Plan" (PP), reveals an architectural grammar that
enables us to predict how all groups conforming to that plan were used. In cases of domestic
PPs, or "houses," a specific plan may reveal the ethnic origins of the occupants. The
emergence of distinct group types at the transition to the Classic period reflects the beginnings
of complex society, but size variation within each PP indicates a heterarchichal rather than a
hierarchichal structure.

[222] Fur Traders, Mormons, Soldiers, and Settlers: An Analysis of Meat
       Subsistence at Fort Bridger
Excavations at Fort Bridger have identified four distinct stratigraphic levels, each representing an
occupation by different social, ethnic, or religious groups. The patterns of meat subsistence for
each of these groups may have varied according to cultural practices, religious beliefs,
fluctuating animal populations, technological advancements, and other such contributing factors.
This paper provides an analysis of the faunal assemblage from Fort Bridger and assesses these,
and other, cultural and environmental factors that conspired to affect the way in which people
made decisions about their diet on the American frontier in the 19th century.

[189] Managing an International Archaeological Field School: The Chau Hiix Model
Conducting an international field school goes beyond designing and implementing a research

before, during and after a field school. Using the Chau Hiix management model this paper
explores information and human resource management techniques, challenges of day-to-day
operations and limitations of working in remote locations. By approaching a field school as not
only a research and learning endeavor, but also as an exercise in people and resource
management, one can expect to assure a mutually productive field season for students,
professors and local residents.

[193] The Many Faces of West Mexican Figurines: What They Can Tell Us
The goal of this paper is to expand upon earlier research regarding the definition of a typological
sequence for the figurines in the Tarascan and pre-Tarascan region of West Mexico. In addition
to presenting a more current understanding of such a typology, it is my goal to offer an
interpretation of the figurines as markers, not only of temporal phases, but also of identity. The
focus of this part of the paper will be on the pre-Tarascan state period and will examine how
such markers of identity can shift with the emergence of a state level society.

[239] Plague or Promise? Frogs and Toads from New York's Engelbert Site
Excellent faunal preservation at the Engelbert Site may provide a unique look at the use of frogs
and toads by New York's prehistoric cultures. Recovered from a variety of contexts at the site,
their MNI count places them second only to deer within an assemblage of over 18,000
specimens. Originally dismissed as natural inclusions, new data now suggests that frogs and
toads played both subsistence and ritual roles. Particularly intriguing are two burial vessels that
contained a number of charred, near complete anuran remains. A combined ethnographic and
taphonomic analysis will reevaluate the role of anurans at this multicomponent site.

[18] Burial Patterns of Korean War Casualties: Social Relationships Between the Living and
     the Dead
The position of a body in a burial has long been important in the understanding of the
reconstruction of past events, whether this occurred several years ago or in a recent crime
scene. Additionally, body position in a burial is often seen as an indicator of the relationship
between the decedent and the burial party. Examination of burial practices at two sites
associated with the Korean War (1950-1953) sheds light on this relationship and its importance
in scene reconstruction. The primary social relationships that will be examined are whether the
decedent held friendly or enemy status.

[197] The Geography and Chronology of Carinated Core Chaîne Opératoire
Carinated cores were recognized almost a century ago by Bourlon and Bouyssonie in the French
Aurignacian and had been defined as 'rabot' (push-plane). The nodule was first shaped bifacially,
followed by the creation of an elongated striking platform from the narrow edge toward the
thicker back. A crested bladelet was removed from the narrow front followed by a series of
bladelets, sometimes twisted. The bifacial removals along the continuous crest of the narrow
cores served as stopper. The same technique was employed during the Upper Paleolithic of the
Caucasus as well as the Levant, and therefore cannot serve as a cultural marker of the
Aurignacian culture.

The role of smaller regional centers within the political organization of Classic period (AD 600-
900) southeastern Mesoamerica remains understudied. The El Paraíso valley, located between
this region‘s larger political centers, contains two such regional centers, El Paraíso and El
Cafetal. Despite being located less than 2 km apart, their architectural style, spatial patterning,
and material culture are highly distinct; El Paraíso brokering authority from the Classic Maya
center of Copan with El Cafetal reflecting a local power base. Curiously, this ―twin-center‖
scenario appears to be a region-wide pattern that likely results from this area‘s function as a
borderland.

A lack of regional site distribution studies and systematic investigations of ecological factors have
limited modeling of subsistence agriculture in the prehistoric southwest. My research integrates

[151] The Ideology of Empire: The Andean Legacy of Inca Subjection
As all empires the Incas used an array of ideological discourses to uphold themselves as the
rightful heirs to a universal understanding of civilized society. They subjected a vast number of
Andean polities throughout South America to their cultural norms and particular religious beliefs.
However, this imperial subjection also implicated them in a dangerous game of moral superiority
that facilitated their own demise when they came into conflict with the Spanish empire. This
paper explores this ambivalent subjection that has been further implicated during four centuries
of Andean nation-building and a political construction of a (Hispanicized) Inca past.

Recent findings of a calendric temple complex dating to 2,100 BC, at the middle Chillón valley

other Andean calendars and astronomy will follow, providing the historical framework. Drawing
from analogies to the chronologically later Inca calendar, the calendrical implications of the
Kalasasaya will be examined under the proposed state-calendar model. The hypothesis is that
the construction of Kalasasaya and calendar coincide with the development of a Tiwanaku state
and regional ideological system.

Together with archaeological aspects, such as artefacts and burials, the study of human

the past, but the interpretation of traces on bones are, however, rather crucial for the final
conclusions. A study of prehistoric Danish skulls shows, when compared with pathological bone
collections and known cases, that possible differential causes to traces of traumatic injuries
such as accidental injuries, post mortem damage and diseases should not be ignored. It clearly
helps to illustrate the problems surrounding reliable patterns of aggression.

[206] Patterns of Diversity among the First Farmers
The work that Doug and I have done in measuring strontium isotopes in Neolithic Central Europe
has added a new level of detail in what we know about the spread of agriculture into Europe. By
studying human mobility directly from the skeletons of the people involved, we found that early
Neolithic communities were considerably more diverse than commonly assumed by general
models of the forager-farmer transition. The European Neolithic data indicate generally patrilocal
marriage customs, and potential mobility-related specializations such as pastoralism vs.
cultivation that may have corresponded with family lineages. This research has led to my current
studies of the transition to agriculture in Thailand, which shows interesting contrasts with the
patterns in Europe.

[226] Strangers No More: Method AND Theory in Flaked Stone Studies
Flaked stone artifacts have been ubiquitous in the archaeological record beginning with the
earliest human sites. Therefore, studies devoted to the analysis and interpretation of flaked stone
are central to understanding human behavior. The interpretation of flaked stone assemblages,
however, is often limited in scope, focusing on the development of techniques and their
application to research questions in limited geographic areas. While flaked stone studies
certainly apply theory inherent in the discussion of human behavior, they have not focused on
integrating their studies with larger theoretical matters. This paper explores the history of flaked
stone analysis and interpretation and argues that it is crucial to apply explicitly theoretical
constructs to flaked stone analyses to achieve a greater understanding of the human past.

Bladelet production is often used to distinguish Neandertals from modern humans suggesting the
latter's cognitive superiority. However, in clear late Mousterian contexts at El Castillo and Cueva
Morin, we have a complete "Chaîne Opératoire" sequence of bladelet production based on a

extraordinary which gives rise to new collective subjectivities.

Between 500-1100 AD, the Tiwanaku culture of the southern Lake Titicaca Basin developed into

and redistribution to indirect trade, allowing local centers to maintain some autonomy. Identifying
the distribution of resources obtained through trade and/or local production is central to
understanding the processes giving rise to the state. This paper discusses insights gained

[221] The Construction and Use of the "Other" at Chichen Itza and Tula Recent research
considers Tula and Chichen Itza's relationship as more nuanced and multi-directional than
previously thought. As a result new ideas have emerged to interpret the nature of this
exchange. An important aspect to consider in these discussions is how each city's inhabitants
saw and used the concept of the "other" or "foreignness." Interaction with the "other" led both
cities to manipulate ideas of foreignness through iconography, architecture, ceramics and other
archaeological data. An exploration of this idea provides insights into similarities and
differences between these two Tollans, their relationship to the broader landscape they
occupied and the utility of this concept in the study of complex societies.

[138] The Prehistoric Sources of Obsidian on the Island of Lipari, Italy: Preliminary Results
       Using LAICPMS
Our preliminary results of LAICPMS analysis performed on obsidian derived from in situ
prehistorically available obsidian flows on the island of Lipari were studied in order to determine
which of these flows were likely utilized by people during the Neolithic period. Our results seem
to indicate that both Gabellotto Gorge and Canneto Dentro volcanic vents produced high quality
obsidian that was exploited during the Neolithic and that both of these sources of obsidian
formed an integral part of a long-distance coastal trade network.

there is an apparent contradiction between what is said in a classroom and what we do outside

Very little is known from the final Upper Paleolithic west of Gibraltar and south of the Tagus

suggest highly diverse cultural, economic and technological systems. Thus, there is an important
hiatus for the Tardiglacial phase of human occupation in southwestern Iberia. This paper will
focus on two main aspects of the early Holocene in Iberia: explanatory models for the hiatus, and
the settlement and subsistence dynamics during the Mesolithic and early Neolithic of
Southwestern Portugal.

case study - the phenomenon of Neolithic enclosures - I will use a contextual approach to
highlight that ritual practices function at both a community and at an individual level, and as
social and communicative acts. I will also stress that ritual practice ought to be contextualised
with the material culture and the place associated with it in order to better understand and
theorise its complex meaning in prehistoric religious life.

[203] Acritarchs & Palynomorphs: A Different Approach to Chert Artifact Sourcing
Numerous techniques and methods have been developed for raw material sourcing. Widely
utilized in biostratigraphy and paleoenvironmental reconstruction, palynological analysis is a
promising technique for chert artifact sourcing. Specifically, the examination of acritarchs, an
artificial grouping of organic walled microfossils, allows for the differentiation of members within
chert formations; therefore greater precision in determining provenance. Results from the
analysis of samples from the Bark Site, southern Ontario, illustrates that this increased accuracy

[212] Reconstructing Culle Ethnicity from the Discarded Fragments of Daily Life: Household
      Archaeology at Cerro León in the Moche Valley
From approximately AD 1-200 Cerro León, a hilltop town in the middle Moche Valley, was
occupied by immigrants from the adjacent highlands. Occupants of the settlement were probably
the ancestors of the Culle-speaking people of the northern highlands mentioned in ethnohistoric
documents. In this paper we examine the challenges of reconstructing Culle ethnic identity.
Analysis of the arrangement of domestic space, manufacture and use of domestic pottery, trash
disposal patterns, and rituals practices reveals that the Culle residents of Cerro León were
ethnically distinct from contemporary coastal people in the Moche Valley.

share widely. This cooperation does not appear to be mutualistic. Two hunters do no better
than one. Only poorer hunters do better by cooperating. Better hunters do worse in groups, but
most cooperate more than 70% of the time. Why then do good hunters cooperate? We evaluate
a number of alternative explanations, including he possibility that better hunters are engaged in
conspicuous generosity, a form of costly signaling.

correlation between domestic space, house shrines and mortuary contexts, particularly in
association with women, infants and children. These same "domestic" activity areas are
surrounded by the remains of specialty craft production and possible elite residences, further
confusing the true function of these spaces. How did Conchopata houses work, who inhabited
them and what was their association to the rest of the site? By looking at construction details,

[117] Commoner Ritual and Socio-Political Life: Investigations at the Northeast Group, Chan,

Investigations at a Late Classic neighborhood at the site of Chan, Belize examine the process

confidently of commoners as laborers and producers, we usually ignore them as socially and
economically diverse individuals. Excavations over the last two years have identified
considerable diversity between households, suggesting that neighborhood occupants shaped
social status and identity through the control of feasting and farming ceremonies. The ability to
actively manipulate their status forces archaeologists to consider how commoner activities, no
matter how ―mundane‖, may have impacted wider social, political, and economic networks.

[162] ESR Dating Deposits in the Neanderthal Layers at La Ferrassie, Dordogne, France
At La Ferrassie, the 1902-1923 excavations found a deposit described as a cemetery containing
seven Neanderthals, including an adult, two children and four infants/neonates, associated with
many Ferrassie Mousterian artifacts and herbivores. Later, Delporte discovered another adult in
the same bed. Because the site was excavated before the advent of modern dating methods, the
age for the skeletons remains controversial. One tooth excavated from the layer that yielded
these skeletons has been analyzed by standard and isochron ESR. Due to relatively low U
concentrations in the tooth, the U uptake model does not cause any substantial uncertainty in the
ages.

[133] Retouch at the Interface between Raw Materials and Technological Organization
The interpretation of structures of technological organization depends upon the identification of
the sequential products of reduction technology and the utilization of those various products. Use
wear analyses have emphasized the importance of expediency and that utilization is a broader
concept than is implied by the presence of retouch. The influence of continual and repeated
retouch on modem perceptions of tool typologies is increasingly recognized. The presence of
retouch and the varying intensities of that retouch do provide a critical means of identifying
realities regarding specific lithic raw materials and prehistoric landscapes, even if structures of
social organization inferred from these technological and geographic realities are less clear.

Did early states develop because they provided beneficial services, or were they primarily

formation, but have not been subject to systematic evaluation. Collective action theory
transcends the benefits versus power argument by specifying the conditions under which states
will develop either as systems of domination or as providers of public goods based on an

Sequential analysis lets archeologists study the production and use of stone tools and the
operation of other past activities. Sequential models have been developed in diverse theoretical
schools suggesting that highly patterned sequential activities are an essential element of
technology. Most archeological sequence models emphasize their length. By defining the series
of steps that make up an activity, archeologists have defined cultural patterns and addressed
how tasks were organized and executed. Using sequential models to address the behavioral
diversity - or "breadth" - of technological activities allows archeologists to address evolutionary
issues and ideas developed by cognitive psychologists.

Origin stories indigenous to the American Southeast recount how ancestral groups emerged

with major cultural transformations punctuated by discontinuities in ceramic traditions.
Abandoned mounds were dormant power objects appropriated to validate new claims. Mound
reclamation inaugurated, challenged or transformed mythic histories.

Nothing is more central to theories of prehispanic Andean state formation than relationships

land division resulted in inequalities among households. Soil deposition in lowland areas and

[80] Nutritional Values and Life History Strategies: Factors Affecting Fish Species Choice at
     the Moss Landing Hill Site, Monterey, CA
In Monterey Bay, CA, people have fished intensively over the last 8500 years, focusing on
different species through time. Fish species have differing nutritional value and life history
strategies, both of which affect their usefulness as part of the human diet. This poster considers
the body composition and life histories, including seasonal timing of their nearshore availability,
of several fish species found at the Moss Landing Hill Site (CA-Mnt-234) in Monterey Bay.
These data help estimate major factors affecting the species choice evident in the
archaeological record.

[233] Between Imperial Integration and Microhistory: Domestic Contexts in Roman Amheida,
      Egypt
This paper explores the integrative phase of empires, a process that continues long after the
dramatic acts of conquest and submission have ended. I explore this process on a microscale in
order to understand local and non-elite negotiations, responses, and influences. Specifically, I
focus on domestic contexts from the Roman city of Amheida (ancient Trimithis) in the Dakhleh
Oasis. Amheida has a long occupational history, but it was under Roman rule that it reached its
greatest extent (1st century AD-4th century AD). This historical trajectory offers an excellent
example of a locality that developed during a period of social, religious, economic, and political
change.

[174] The Taphonomy of Human Bone at Formative La Laguna
Excavations at La Laguna yield few complete skeletons in purpose-made graves. Human bone,
however, is common in architectural fills, middens, and bell-shaped pits. By considering
stratigraphic context, representation of different skeletal segments and signs of bone
modification we distinguish between accidental redeposition and mortuary practice. Finds of
articulated body parts and cut-marks on bone suggest dismemberment or defleshing of corpses,
intentional re-opening of graves, and the selective curation and discard of human remains. In
one area of the site, we believe to have identified specialized refuse deposits associated with
such practices, next to a burial ground.

[111] Body Theory in Archaeology: A Review
As a context for the symposium, this paper reviews the theorization of the human body in
archaeology. The core of it is a resume and appraisal of key works in diverse areas of
archaeology (gender and sexuality; art and representation; space, movement and architecture;
burial; foodways; dress and adornment; gesture, violence and technology). We also briefly
suggest the reasons why an archaeology of the body is central to social archaeology, the
working principles of such an archaeology, and some of the theoretical and methodological
problems it is likely to encounter.

[232] Plant Remains from the Bronze and Iron Age Megiddo, Israel
A retrieval of macro plant remains was initiated at the renewed excavations of Megiddo, Israel.
Analysis of flotation samples from the 2000 season provided plant material for the analysis. The
identified plants represent an expected repertory of plant remains typical for many Near Eastern
assemblages. Emmer was the major crop, while bread wheat was present in small quantities.
The implementation and amelioration of flotation technique yielded plant material that provided
important information about part of human and animal diet, weed infestation of crops, use of
different types of fuel, and possible plant funerary offerings at this important site.

[144] The Lost Evidence: The Extinction of Pleistocene Megamammals in South America
One of the oldest unsolved questions of South American archaeology concerns the extinction of
Pleistocene megamammals. Data produced in South America itself is rarely considered in
synthetic papers and books, which sometimes even claim that there is no adequate data. The
main point of this presentation is that there is a wealth of both paleontological and archaeological
data which may help in the evaluation of the different theories used to interpret that event.

[74] Silver Mound--Source of Hixton Silicified Sandstone
The Silver Mound quarry complex in the Upper Mississippi River Valley is key to researching
regional lithic procurement strategies. Its unique geological setting enables artifacts
manufactured from Hixton Silicified Sandstone to be attributed to a single source, providing
resolution for studies examining lithic acquisition, transport, and discard strategies. This poster
presents a framework for understanding interrelationships between the condition of curated tools
at discard and their spatial proximity to Silver Mound. We then evaluate how strategies of lithic
raw material procurement were organized by Paleoindians in the western Great Lakes and
Upper Mississippi River Valley.

[103] Defining the Bennyhoff Ceramic Sphere: A New Look at Changes
As powers in the Maya Peten waned, important centers such as Chichén Itzá rose to power in
northern Yucatan in the Late-Terminal Classic (ca. AD 800-1150). A coastal trade network
developed along the Caribbean, whereby northern influence spread to coastal and riverine
settlements as far south as Belize. The newly defined Bennyhoff Ceramic Sphere encompasses
an influx of northern related ceramics and iconographical and architectural elements. The
ceramics represented in this sphere are distinct from the Peten-affiliated sphere ceramics.
Recent research and documentation of the ceramics are presented in relation to population
dispersals and long-distance interactions during this time.

[138] Examination of the Suitability of Geochemical Analysis in Characterizing Native
      American Chert Quarries in Vermont
Native American chert quarries within the State of Vermont represent an important, if not under-
studied, archaeological resource. Despite the relatively widespread use of geochemistry in
archaeology elsewhere, archaeologists in Vermont have been relatively slow to adopt these
techniques. A key first step in overcoming this deficiency is to evaluate available techniques and
determine which may be the most useful to the archaeologist. New data is presented concerning
the efficacy of geochemical analysis in discriminating between known chert quarries and
recommendations are made for future research.

[103] Phytolith Analysis of Ceramics from Liangchengzhen, Shandong, China
Previous investigations at the Liangchengzhen site in the eastern Shandong province of China
have demonstrated the presence of rice, millet, soybeans, and wheat during the Longshan
period. Silicified plant cells, or phytoliths, remain in context and provide an effective means of
discerning the presence of these plants. A total of 25 sherds from several pottery types (guan,
ding, yan, gui, pen) were analyzed for the presence of plant phytoliths in order to better
understand ceramic usage. Results from this study, when integrated with faunal, macrobotanical,
and isotope data, provide information on cultural dietary patterns for the Longshan culture.

[111] Bodily Practices and Queer Places
The reflexive and explicit monitoring of the body, of gesture, of positioning and posture, of dress

paper discusses the practices and perceptions involved in queer sexual geographies, focussing
specifically on the ways in which certain types of place are put to queer use through a range of
conventionalized body practices. How does a queer sense of place result in the construction of
such spaces, and which factors make a place suitable or unsuitable for queer appropriation? The
implications for the writing of queer histories/archaeologies are emphasized.

[129] Variation in Ceramic Assemblages on the Jemez Plateau
We examine ceramic assemblage variability at fieldhouses across the Jemez Plateau to address

of large pueblos for farming, hunting, and as lookouts. Numbering in the thousands, fieldhouses
are the most common site type on the Jemez Plateau. We utilize a large sample of these short-
term occupation sites to examine spatial and temporal variability at a fine scale. This analysis
focuses on range and frequency of ceramic types at the assemblage level to determine temporal
occupation of sites and address population movement and relative population size through time.

Analysis of starch granules, phytoliths, and plant macrofossils from archaeological features and
carbonized food residue provides important new insight into the extent of prehistoric maize
consumption on the North American Great Plains. These data suggest that consumption of
maize, and probably other cultigens, was widespread on the eastern Canadian Prairies between
approximately AD 1000 to 1600. Domesticated plants may have been grown locally, acquired
through trade, or transported into the region following dispersal of family groups from horticultural
villages located elsewhere.

[10] Bioarchaeology, Imperialism, and Ethnogenesis in the Inka Province of
     Chachapoyas, Perú
Inka imperialism was a dynamic process and imperial strategies varied between provinces. One
common aspect, however, was demographic rearrangement of subjugated populations, often
combining previously discrete ethnic groups. Ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence
suggest that numerous culturally-related yet autonomous societies were subsumed within the
Inka province of Chachapoyas. This research examines the consequences of Inka imperialism
and the process of Chachapoya ethnogenesis utilizing both biological and archaeological data.
The effects of Inka imperialism in Chachapoyas are compared with consequences observed in
other Andean regions, as well as contrasted with those described in European models.

[133] Raw Material Variation and Calculating the Original Mass of Retouched Flakes
A series of experiments producing retouched flakes using various raw materials and two
reduction modes were conducted by two flintknappers. Materials varied considerably in
knapping quality and provide a means to explore the relationship between raw material type,
resharpening, and tool uselife. A variety of attributes were recorded for each flake produced.
Preliminary analysis indicates that raw material type is important for estimating original flake
mass, but a tripartite division of quality may be sufficient to account for the variation. No
significant differences are evident between the two knappers. Equations used to calculate
original flake mass from retouched flakes must be derived with a consideration of raw material.

Glass beads have been in California since the first Spanish expeditions in the 18th century and
were quickly incorporated into a preexisting shell bead network. The extent and duration of this
network produced the patterned variability of glass beads present in the archaeological record.
Morphological studies have addressed stylistic and technological patterning; now we need to
look at specific glass recipes and their corresponding chemical signatures that are associated
with particular factories at particular time periods. In this study we use laser-ablation ICP-MS to
chemically characterize a collection of archaeological glass beads from the Great Basin area of
eastern California.

[29] Leaving No Stone Unturned: The Identification and Interpretation of Unmodified or Minimally

As cave investigations have become more intensive and archaeologists are more familiar with
the cave environment, sets of unmodified or minimally modified stone manuports have come to
light. To date these have been inconsistently treated and little interpretation has been attempted.
This paper describes a number of such stones recovered from lowland Maya caves, reviews the
archaeological literature to show that such objects occur in cache and burial contexts, and finally
examines the ethnographic literature to demonstrate that such stones are frequently imbued by
modern people in Mesoamerica with a range of social and religious meanings.

[89] Fishing in the Long Durée: A Global Perspective on the Antiquity of Fishing
Although the antiquity and importance of aquatic adaptations have been recognized as central to
the development of post-Pleistocene cultural evolution, the focus has centered on the
association between maritime adaptations and the, often, late development of political and
cultural complexity. A growing body of archaeological evidence suggests, however, that early
aquatic adaptations including shellfish gathering, fishing, seafaring, and marine mammal hunting
may have played an important role in the expansion of modern humans. We explore the earliest
evidence of marine fishing in the archaeological record and discuss the implications of marine
resources in human evolution.

traits found in both regions as evidence of the exertion of hegemonic power. Little attention was
given to identifying the theoretical reasons why shared styles must imply military intrusion,
migration, or diaspora. In this paper, I suggest a more flexible model for Early Postclassic
interaction based on Manuel Castell's concept of the Network Society and recent developments
in the mathematical field of Graph Theory.

The Oldowan may represent a significant adaptive event in the evolution of Pliocene hominins.
Descriptions of Oldowan hominin technology focus on variation in hominin behavioral complexity.
Yet, often these descriptions are developed without extensive contextual information, which limits

size and broad raw material composition of Kanjera South make it an ideal setting for
investigating variation within the Oldowan. We provide some preliminary insights into the impact

Hundreds of prehistoric chert quarries have been documented in the polydeformed Cambrian

technology fashioned from quartzites and other metamorphic rocks. Comparative research in
equivalent-age rocks of the Champlain Valley (New York), and younger rocks in the Delaware

Sociopolitical developments of Chancay and Chimu on the central and the north-central coasts of

[195] A Strict Reading of Costly Signals in Archaeology Through Sex-based Biases in Stylized

Archaeologists have used costly signaling theory to address issues ranging from hunting and
sharing to pyramid-building. In a sample of world-wide ethnographic societies, sex-based biases
in the acquisition of raw material for decorating ceramics seems to qualify as another costly
signal. Males acquire raw material at much greater distance or cost than females do, even
though decoration does little to improve utilitarian aspects of a pot. But do these data conform to
a strict Zahavian definition of costly signals? For various reasons, they probably do not. To what
extent can a strict definition of costly signals help or hinder archaeologists?

[244] Laboratory Studies of Some European Artifacts Excavated on San Salvador Island,
       Bahamas
Investigations at the Long Bay site uncovered artifacts of European manufacture intermingled
with native Indian artifacts. These include seven very small glass beads (and fragments of three
others), a coin, a small metal buckle, a D-ring, 32 sherds of melado ware, and two small sherds
of white-glazed ware. Laboratory studies have been conducted to help determine the origins
and dates of these artifacts. The glass beads are wire-wound and have an extremely high lead
chemical composition. The coin is a billon blanca of Henry IV minted between 1471-1474. Both
buckles were found to be lightly-leaded bronzes. The melado ware has a lead glaze, as do the
white wares, although the latter contain tin. All of the artifacts contain intentionally added lead.
Their isotope ratios spread over a range, but all are consistent with Spanish origins. The data
indicate that the San Salvador artifacts were made in three locations within Spain.

[236] The Art of Dance at Teotihuacan
Images of dance and related rituals are well known in many Mesoamerican cultures, including
the Aztec and ancient Maya. Dance imagery is also present at Teotihuacan. As portrayed in the
murals of the Tepantitla compound, human figures are shown dancing and playing music. A
comparison with ethnohistoric and archaeological sources for both the Aztec and ancient Maya
suggests that scenes of dance at Tepantitla may also indicate the performance of rituals,
dramatic poetry, and other formalized speech.

[177] Results of Survey in Central Yucatan, Mexico
In 2005, we performed both purposive and systematic survey in the central portion of the state of
Yucatan, Mexico. Our project area extended from Acanceh in the northwest to Yaxuna in the
northeast, south to Plato, west to Mani, and then returned north to Acanceh after passing
through the site of Mayapan. We investigated approximately 35 sites, most of which were
previously unreported, and we systematically surveyed approximately 10 km of transects, finding
a relatively high density of rural settlement. The survey provided significant new information
about settlement patterns in this key central area of the Maya lowlands.

[245] Defining Change within Plantation Landscapes
Common perspectives of plantation landscapes are often framed by colonial revival evocations,
stand-alone house museums, or inscrutable plowed fields. Landscape archaeology, including
excavations into plowed contexts, can provide a deeper understanding of the networks of
buildings, activity areas, and open space that comprised the dynamic historic landscape.
Plowzone data from surveys, intensive testing, or full-scale excavation, can provide vital
information about landscape change at the individual building level and plantation wide context.
This paper draws on plowzone evidence from sites in Gloucester County to display the social
and economic evolution of southeastern Virginia plantations from 1650 to 1900.

[206] Tensions at Transitions
Short-term temporal scales give rise to a very different view about social change than long term
ones. The annual and decadal scale is thought of as history; the multi-hundred year scale is one
of evolution. Both have their distinct explanatory modes. Just how the macro-scale evolutionary
perspective meshes with the micro-scale historical one, if indeed they do, is a challenging
problem. One aspect to this problem is to pre-judge the inevitability of transitions, say from
foraging to farming economies. Different scales are easily confused by the outcome. A case in
point is Jared Diamond‘s book, Guns, Germs and Steel.

[54] "Good to Dream With:" Ritual Collection, Power, and Access to the
     Supernatural Among Contemporary Maya Ritual Practitioners
The tradition of ritually collecting archaeological objects is widespread among contemporary
Maya ritual practitioners. Through collecting artifacts, incipient ritual practitioners become aware
of, and actively participate in, divine election with its supernatural sanction for a change in social
status. Rather than being viewed through an archaeological lens, ritually collected and curated
artifacts are ―seats‖ of power for potent ancestral deities who teach their caretakers esoteric
knowledge in the dream world. By engaging in the ongoing collection and curation archaeological
objects, individuals actively communicate with important ancestral forces and directly access
supernatural power thereby subverting the agenda of dominant Christian sects.

The northern Chibchan peoples lived in close proximity to a series of Mayan and, later,
Mexicanized Maya and Mexican cultures such as the Pipiles and Nicarao. The topic of
Mesoamerican influence on the material and ideological culture of these Chibchan peoples has
received little attention and Mesoamerican items or motifs on artifacts found in the Chibchan
realms have generally been ascribed to ―influence‖ or down-the-line trade. However, a
Mesoamerican influence is more pervasive and argues for close relations between some of the
northern Chibchan speakers and those Mesoamericans who were their close neighbors, trading
partners, and competitors in land tenure and warfare.

inhabitants. While radically different from their previous independent pastoral lifestyle, this study
shows that the iron workers did not completely lose their independence in decisions about labor

[188] Rockshelter Utilization in the Eastern Woodlands: Patterns of Stability & Change
Rockshelters are enduring features in the natural landscape; they remain unchanged for
thousands of years. The human cultures utilizing these shelters, however, are more ephemeral –
settlement, subsistence and trade networks change. Therefore, the functional potential of a
rockshelter is dependent upon the cultural landscape in which it is embedded. This study of
rockshelter use in the woodlands of northcentral Ohio over the past 12,000 years documents this
pattern of changing spatial relationships. Although a rockshelter may be repeatedly utilized over
many millennia, its function can vary from a base camp or hunting camp, to a rest area or
catchment site.

The transition to fanning in southeastern Europe is discussed as the palimpsest relates to

farming was embedded in the existing, regional pre-Neolithic social structures. It was set by
networks of social relationships and contacts, as well as the traditional, socially and culturally
defined principles of intergenerational and inter-community transmission of knowledge. People,
through contact, local and/or regional mobility, provided the agency for selective incorporation
of innovations such as cultigens, domesticates and pottery, and in a social context allowed for
changes to the structural framework.

the founder of the Copán dynasty and sacrificial victims as northern immigrants. Equally
significant, however, are the transformational, revisionist histories wrought by mourners.
Extended post-interment rituals involving tomb re-entry and pilgrimage reveal a complex
interplay between ancestor veneration the manipulation of social memory. We also link artifactual

[125] Reading the Land and Looking for Friends: The Impact of the Landscape on Social
       Integration during the Middle Palaeolithic
The persistence of Neanderthal populations in topographically complex regions suggests that
they were sensitive to the landscape. A key aspect of landscape is legibility; a "legible"
environment facilitates interactions between individuals in thinly dispersed hunter-gatherer
populations by providing a coherent structure. In the absence of recurrent networks of social
relations, hunter-gatherer groups are poorly integrated regionally and their long-term viability is at
stake - particularly during times of crisis. This situation worsens if, as is proposed for the
Neanderthals, there are few social mechanisms for maintaining social relationships beyond co-
presence and predictable aspects of the landscape are key to structuring social networks.

[152] A Model of the Relationship between Environmental Variables, Physical and Cultural
       Characteristics on Irrigation Systems in Arid Lands
A model of the relationship between the most important environmental variables in arid lands,
irrigation infrastructure characteristics and sociocultural features on irrigation systems is
developed. The model is an effort to resolve theoretical problems of anthropological and
archaeological thought on the topic. There appears to be a discernible relationship between
environment, physical and cultural variables in the configuration of irrigation systems in arid
lands.

[211] Being of Two Minds: Dual-Process Grieving and Bell-Wethering in Mortuary Trends
The dual-process model of grief identifies a common psychological propensity to use both
confrontation and avoidance as equally effective strategies for coping with death and loss. It
therefore offers a way to account for dramatic variation in the permanence and archaeological
visibility of mortuary expressions in particular cultural settings. The simultaneous exercise of both
strategies at the level of populations and a tendency to follow emergent trends in either direction
is a basis for explaining oscillations in mortuary behaviour. The examples of Victorian England
and various long-term archaeological trends illustrate these common individual propensities and
their culture-historical consequences.

[80] Efficiency, Risk, and the Evolution of Agricultural Economies
Some behavioral ecologists have approached issues relating to the evolution of agriculture by
using a time allocation model that employs average productive efficiency as a currency. This
poster discusses an extension of this model that incorporates risk, or variability in gross
production, which has long been considered also to be relevant to the evolution of agriculture.
This theoretical framework can be used to develop hypotheses about the causes of agricultural
evolution, and tests and potential tests of these hypotheses are discussed. This theoretical
framework also shows how HBE and ―selectionist‖ approaches can be integrated to build more
complete evolutionary explanations.

[159] Constructing Identity: Architectural Practice, Identity, and Affiliation in the El Paraíso
       Valley, Department of Copan, Honduras
Centrally located between the Classic Maya centers of Copan and Quirigua and with access to
non-Maya hubs to the east, the El Paraíso valley was a critical node within the interregional
exchange network of western Honduras. Its inhabitants were likely required to form, negotiate,
and maintain multiple and distinct corporate identities and affiliations. These distinctions were
made manifest through several obtrusive and eye-catching media, including the architectural
style and spatial planning of their elite centers. This paper explores how and why clear and
blatant differences between the contemporaneous El Paraíso and El Cafetal sites relate to the
valley‘s borderland status.

[3] Prehispanic Political Evolution and the Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley of Mexico: A GIS Study
The Puebla-Tlaxcala Valley of central Mexico witnessed the evolution of local regional polities
during the Middle-Terminal Formative periods (c. 800-1 BC), and cycles of political expansion
initiated by the highly centralized states of the adjacent Basin of Mexico during the Classic and
Postclassic periods (c. AD 1-1519). This study reevaluates settlement and environmental data,
which were gathered in Puebla-Tlaxcala by regionally focused projects during the 1960s and
1970s, using contemporary GIS applications. The assessment of regional settlement hierarchies,
land use, and their changes over three millennia provides new insights into central Mexican
political evolution.

of more complex societal organization. Data from Formative (c. 900-600 BC) Tlaxcala, will be
presented, focusing on formal and stylistic analyses of ceramic assemblages, combined with a
general assessment of village political economy and ritual activities, to examine theories of
cooperation, and outline archaeological expectations for such practices.

[17] Lithotechnical Mode I: Evidence from Atapuerca
Technical Modes are cultural demarcations applied to the tangible lithic record. The conventional
scheme defines Mode I as assemblages devoid of large morphotypes (e.g. handaxes, cleavers,
and picks). Such industries are known 2.5 -0.4 Ma. Mode II refers to lithic industries that include
large tools, and span 1.6 to 0.1 Ma. This scheme should be revised given recent research
advances. Accepting Kada Gona (2.5 Ma in Ethiopia), Dmanisi (1.8 Ma in Georgia) and
Atapuerca (1.0 Ma in Spain) as Mode 1 occurrences, we need to establish technological criteria
for defining these assemblages and placing them in the same lithotechnic complex.

The arrival of Spaniards transformed many elements of Mesoamerican life, including material

cultural and military centers. The ceramic assemblage from the short occupation (1528-1545) of
Ciudad Vieja, El Salvador includes only small numbers of typical colonial markers, subtle yet
informative hybridization of two ceramic traditions, and overall continuity with Postclassic pottery
but with key exceptions. This example offers an important opportunity to inform the study of
multi-component sites elsewhere in Mesoamerica.

An important facet to understanding lithic technological organization revolves around our ability
to understand not only how stone tools were produced but also how they were maintained
through their use-life cycles. This paper represents a case study of the possible means that lithic
tools were produced and maintained during the Early Neolithic at Dhra', Jordan. This is
accomplished by replication of retouch patterns through production, use, and maintenance
complimented by a use-wear study of replicated and archaeological samples. Conclusions from
this study will aid in our understanding of lithic technological and human organizational strategies
during the transition to agriculture.

[226] The Organization of Great Lakes Paleoindian Lithic Procurement Strategies
It is evident that procuring suitable quantities of lithic raw material is a constant and reoccurring

Instead, the procurement of lithic raw materials needs to be evaluated within a multifaceted,

beyond their simple acquisition. Such a framework, employed here, examines lithic raw material
procurement strategies among Great Lakes Paleoindians. This analysis demonstrates how
procurement strategies may become organized around concerns external to the manufacture of
stone tools. Consideration of these external concerns, including mobility or social needs,
enables the formulation of questions regarding why one procurement strategy is selected over
another.

technologies were organized to meet the social and economic needs of people, and how
technological change is related to long-term cultural change. Our approach is empirical and
based in part on experimentation for understanding the process of lithic assemblage formation,
including: raw material acquisition, tool production, use, reuse, and discard. Multiple lines of
evidence are advocated for testing low-level inferences as well as more general hypotheses.

[199] Holocene Pollen Records from Mediterranean Spain: Palaeoecological Contingency
       Vs. the Determinism of the Climate System
Using pollen sequences from Mediterranean Spain, we contend that conventional views of
vegetation-climate response are too deterministic to explain patterns of Late Quaternary
vegetation change in the region satisfactorily. In a contingent view of vegetation dynamics, subtle
differences in initial conditions during full glacial and late glacial times would have tended to
cascade and affect the outcome of postglacial events. Therefore, duplicating the exact sequence
of vegetation types for a particular site is statistically improbable. Moreover, phenomena such as
fire, hervibory, deforestation, and competitive interactions could be contingent yet remain
compatible with the determinism of the climate system.

[8] Are Panamanian Pre-Columbian Shell Deposits "Shell Mounds" or "Shell-bearing Middens:" A
    Diachronic and Geographic Evaluation
Archaeologists have been preoccupied for a long time about how to classify strata that contain
shells in their matrices. In the 1950s ―early‖ (7000-3000 BP) coastal sites were discovered in
Panama, which have come to be known in the literature as "shell mounds" (i.e. Cerro Mangote
and Monagrillo). These and all other pre-Columbian shell deposits in Panama, however, contain
not only mollusks, but also a diverse vertebrate fauna, and different categories of artifacts. In this
paper I argue that Panamanian sites, which contain large amounts of shell, are not shell mounds
per se, but rather ―shell-bearing middens‖ according to Widmer‘s terminology.

including: "use" value, "exchange" value, and "esteem" value are identified. By examining the
relationship between artifact and the individual, elements of social theory are also introduced.
Through these relationships we can then ask, can consumer behavior regarding illicit goods be
addressed through the artifact record?

three millennia, agricultural activities had been largely restricted to lowland plains and river

once forested or reserved for pasture helped to trigger severe soil erosion and land degradation

Many archaeologists view village formation as causal in the development of group identity and

a lengthy, contested process of place-making beginning in periods of dispersed settlement. In
the Salinas area, differences in access to symbolic, social, and material resources demonstrate
marked divisions of identity and power among dispersed settlements. The construction of
masonry pueblos in the centers of these settlements reveals both the elaboration and contested
nature of existing distinctions, and shows that place-making is a continual social process, of
which aggregation is one strategy.

period characterized by the Saxe/Binford approach, one theoretical framework (centered on
adaptation) sufficed for studying both the biological and sociocultural aspects of cemeteries.
Today different approaches to these components describe the processual/postprocessual debate
of the last 25 years: The skeletons are still analyzed in biological terms; but the meanings of
facility preparation, grave goods, etc., are best explored through interpretive sociology. How
does (or can) one researcher effectively shift between these two very distinct metaphors? Are
Darwinian and Marxian paradigms mutually exclusive?

[49] Two Types of Urbanism: The Teotihuacan and Aztec Occupations in the Eastern
     Teotihuacan Valley
Recent research in the Aztec city-state of Otumba and in the rural dependencies of Teotihuacan
has investigated the settlement structure as well as the social, economic, and political ties
between the urban centers and their dependencies in each period. Differences in scale are
obvious and important, but variability in structure and function is also present. Aztec urban-rural
organization is strongly related to the economic, political, and religious ties between the city of
Otumba and the surrounding country-side. That of Teotihuacan appears to have a similar formal
structure but a varying suite of functional relationships with the rural components.

[4] Indigenous Ceramic Technology of Spanish Colonial Peru
In the archaeological record of Peru, glazed pottery is an essential temporal marker for detecting
Spanish Colonial contexts. This study develops strategies for examining unglazed hybrid pottery
generated by the use of indigenous potters in Spanish workshops and the lack of preferred
materials in remote areas of the viceroyalty. Attention is paid to comparisons of paste
technologies within the same time period as well as paste recipes within the same vessel class
over many periods. In particular, this analysis evaluates the influence of glaze technology on the
local potting tradition in early Spanish Colonial times of highland Peru.

[65] Huitsiniki: A Man of Special Status in the Late Archaic of Highland Michoacán
During excavations at Alberca Rockshelter, an Archaic site in the Meseta Purépecha Michoacán,
Mexico, excavators encountered an unusual human skeleton beneath an extensive pictograph
panel. Osteological analysis of this individual, whose remains were radiocarbon dated at more
than 5000 years, indicated an approximately 30 year-old male who exhibited light muscle
development and appears to have had his maxillary teeth removed at the gumline to
accommodate a ceremonial prosthesis. These findings, along with the skeleton's location,
suggest the man, named by the contemporary Purépecha as Huitsiniki, held a special position in
a society at the threshold of agriculture.

[207] The Yaya-Mama Religious Tradition as an Antecedent of Sociopolitical Complexity
      in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Peru and Bolivia
The origins of monumentality in the Lake Titicaca Basin can be traced back to the Yaya-Mama
Religious Tradition (ca. 800 BC-AD 200/300). This endogenous tradition has been defined by the
following major indicators of the emergence of sociopolitical complexity: Temples with sunken
courts associated with stone sculpture, ritual objects involving trumpets and ceremonial burners,
and iconography with supernatural indicators. This long enduring tradition represents the first
public architecture in the region, where the landscape was transformed into a series of sacred
centers or temple domains. Many elements continued into the later Tiahuanaco culture and
some architectural features into Inca times.

To develop an archaeology that permits diachronic approaches to the material data and multi-
vocal conceptualizations of the past, text and artistic representations have long been used to
access social behavior and daily activities that were not immediately evident in certain kinds of
material remains. Yet these sources need to be carefully evaluated before they may be more
broadly applied to "fill in the gaps" left by archaeological field work. This paper will take as its
case study Postclassic Central Mexico to examine the production of ethnohistorical texts and
discuss how to qualify them for use by archaeologists and others.

Often contained within the plaster floors of prehistoric houses is microscopic evidence of the
activities of the people who once lived there. To examine the relationship between micro-artifacts
and the larger artifacts of floor assemblages, the entire plaster floor of a late Basketmaker III
pithouse that burned with apparently all of its contents in place was removed in 25 cm2 quadrats.
Flotation of a percentage of these samples resulted in recovery of micro-artifacts and other
material whose distribution reflects the partitioning of domestic space for different activities and

[82] The Genetic Basis for Variation in Cranial Morphology and Its Consequences for
     Prehistoric Population Studies
Genetic variation in cranial morphology is usually found to be at a moderate level in modern
populations. Most importantly, the patterns of co-inheritance of cranial structures reflect patterns
of cranial development and function. This developmental structuring of cranial variation is caused
by the modular effects of genes, most gene effects being limited to specific developmental units
in the skull and mandible. It is critical that this pattern of variation and covariation be accounted
for in studies that try to reconstruct population genetic structure from morphological patterns
found in the archeological record.

An archaeological community, like Chau Hiix, in existence for more than 2,000 years provides an
ideal case study for the investigation of technological change in stone tool manufacture. The
community is located in a part of Belize in which low quality chert is abundant, yet throughout
most of its history, chert tools were imported from other sites. It appears that the site residents
responded to "larger events" in the Maya lowlands by increasing their use of local materials in
times of crises. This paper explores this dynamic pattern and compares it to that in other sites in
Northern Belize.

[60] Agency, Public Spaces and Authority at Huambacho, Peru
Public buildings are the materialization of social institutions. Accordingly, they have the potential
to become agents of social control inasmuch as that they shape and constrain the ritual
experience of certain individuals while promoting the authority of others. Results of recent
excavations at Huambacho (800-200 BC), north-central coast of Peru, indicate that local builders
drew from a stock of knowledge deeply embedded in previous cultural habits while, at the same
time, a discursive attempt was made at rejecting previous religious symbols, thus giving new
meaning to public architecture. I argue these developments played an active role in shaping
authority.

[103] Revealing Wheel-thrown Gray Ware in Batavo-Romano Netherlands
Wheel-thrown ―Batavian‖ gray ware found in the Batavian region of Germania inferior (in
modern day southeastern Netherlands) is not well understood by archaeologists. Dated from
the first to the third centuries AD these pots have the potential to elucidate social relations
between the local Batavians and the colonizing Romans. I present the results of stylistic and
technological analyses in order to discern ranges of variation in raw material and firing method.
A high degree of variation in gray ware manufacture and firing procedure implies pottery
hybridization that resembles Roman forms yet retains Batavian stylistic elements.

[248] 3D Laser Scanning and Analysis of the Miami Circle at Brickell Point Site, Florida
Archaeological monitoring during a construction project in downtown Miami in 1998 led to the
discovery of an 11 m diameter circle of basins carved into oolitic limestone and overlain with
midden deposits. The discovery of the Miami Circle led to great speculation regarding its origin
and function. To better document and interpret the feature laser scanning and conventional
surveying techniques were used to develop a virtual GIS model of the complicated Miami Circle
feature. The GIS data allowed for creation of a contour map, terrain model, analysis of artifact
distribution, and comparison with a recently discovered circular feature located nearby.

[166] Prehistoric Fauna from the South Coast of Cuba
In 1956 and 1957 Paul Hahn excavated at seven sites in the Las Villas, Camaguey, and Oriente
Provinces of Cuba. His research focused on developing a chronological sequence for the non-
ceramic cultures in those areas, which he published in1965. Hahn's excavations yielded a
significant assemblage of vertebrate faunal material which has been in storage at the Peabody
Museum for nearly 50 years. This paper is an analysis of a portion of this faunal collection
focusing on the ecological and economic implications of the assemblage. This is one of the few
faunal studies from this region of the Caribbean.

[171] Memories and Artifacts: Correlating Multiple Perspectives on the Battle of Cibecue
The 1881 Battle of Cibecue began as a response by Apache warriors and Apache scouts to the
US Army‘s arrest of a medicine man. The fight resulted in Apache and cavalry casualties and
continues to affect the Cibecue community and outsiders‘ perspectives thereon. During a recent
study of Apache memories of the Battle, the White Mountain Apache Tribe obtained a series of
artifacts illicitly removed from the suspected Battle site. Our analyses of the artifacts in the
context of Apache memories and Army documents shed light on the fight and on interpretations
derived from archaeology and oral traditions

[50] Measuring Variability in Aggregate-Scale Artifacts on Easter Island
Studies of prehistoric settlement patterns require detailed measurements of stylistic, temporal,
technical, functional and spatial variability of discrete and aggregate-scale artifacts. Although
the archaeology of Easter Island has been extensively surveyed, the results are limited in use
due to the way in which aggregate-scale artifacts were described. Primarily based on modal
and ethnohistoric type-descriptions, much of the variability within aggregate scale artifacts is
lumped into a few, inconsistent and interpretative groups. A critical re-examination of previously
collected survey data for the island shows that new classifications and new archaeological
surveys are required.

[147] Figurines in Action: Contextualizing the Butterfly Personage at Teotihuacan
Current art historical and anthropological narrative theories provide a sound basis for interpreting
the complex iconography of Teotihuacan figurines. Additionally, pictorial ceramics produced
within the ancient city provide enduring evidence of active contexts, of socially significant
performances and ritual activities in which the figures were engaged. Utilizing these resources,
this paper reexamines the iconography of butterfly personages, one of the most enduring images
in Teotihuacan portable arts. Butterfly personages emerge as members of an important
institution within Teotihuacan society, ranked according to activities, and functioning within the
realm of a popular religion that centered on a butterfly deity.

[206] And the Transition to Gender? Diet, Bone Chemistry, and Gendered Implications
Unbeknownst to many, Doug Price was a participant at the 1988 conference that led to the
edited volume, Engendering Archaeology (Gero and Conkey 1991), for which he wrote and
presented a paper on Gender and Diet. His case study was the Archaic of the U.S. Midwest. At
the time, Price suggested that ―one of the reasons for distinguishing male and female diets in the
past is to better understand the human adaptation." He concluded that (unpublished) paper with
the statement that "certainly gender is an important dimension of human variability in the past we
are beginning to look into. The next ten years should open the door." In this paper, I will not only
reveal Price‘s early engagement with gender issues, but look at those proverbial ―next ten years‖
and see to what extent, how, and with what implications his work has/has not continued along
these lines, and how this relates to the wider field of an engendered archaeology since 1988.

[116] The Emergence of Non-Ceremonial Based Urbanism in Late Prehispanic Nasca
A new social landscape developed in the Nasca region during late prehispanic times. Part of this
transformation included the predominance of large, agglutinated, internally differentiated
settlements, a change from previous periods when domestic sites were small, and only
ceremonial centers were built on a large scale. The shift away from ceremonial sites as the focus
of aggregation and centralization suggests a change in the role of religion as an integrating force.
The emergence of a new type of urbanism was likely shaped by a shift in the religious ideology,
an expansion of economic networks, and a multiplicity of social identities.

The landscapes of many Aegean islands consist of complex systems of (abandoned) fieldwalls
and terraces that partition most or all productive and marginally productive land. Historical and
archaeological evidence suggests that these systems were intensively farmed and organised at
the household level of production. A critical feature of household-based agriculture is the form

The Skene quarry (motion) and contiguous Workshop yield particular insights into the types of
instruments necessary for the extraction of cherts from low inclination beds, and processing of
extracted ore in a setting deficient in abundant raw materials necessary for the manufacturing of
quarry tools. The Skene quarry (zone of extraction) typically yields numerous exhausted quarry
implements, however less than expected numbers were recovered. The Workshop (zone of
beneficiation) associated with the quarry, revealed a wealth of recycled quarry and processing
instruments including wedges and debris resulting from the refashioning of mining tools into
forms necessary for ore processing.

Landscape Engineering at Chavín de Huántar
At Chavín de Huántar, research has focused on monumental architecture, but the physical and
conceptual extents of the site need to be construed more broadly. Geomorphologic survey
suggests that there is more to Chavín than immediately evident. Moreover, the area‘s
geomorphologic dynamism was a key element in decision-making processes involved in the
site‘s location, construction, and expansion. Engineering at Chavín centered on monumental
architecture in the site core, but also included land reclamation, river canalization, massive
terracing, and environmental risk management in the surrounding area. These projects suggest
that the structurative possibilities of setting were understood and consciously manipulated by
Chavín‘s designers.

[211] Expressing Life through Death: Mortuary Rituals in Huari Society
The social dimensions of life and death are always closely intertwined, yet if we assume that the
structure of everyday lived experience helps negotiate the conceptions and material expressions
of the body, selfhood and society, then inspiration from living contexts and early contact sources
can shed light on the significance of ancient mortuary places. During the rise of the Huari Empire
dramatic changes occurred in burial practices and in the treatment of the body. We consider both
the skeletal and material remains and find their spatial expression closely associated with the
house. We address how mourners author the transcendence of past community members into
objects of veneration and sources of ancestral protection, inspiration and guidance.

Mississippian cemeteries — are identified. Row formation is examined through a consideration of
burial frequency and the occurrence of diagnostic artifacts. Burial rows are then linked with
individual households, whose histories are examined using radiometric, architectural, and
diagnostic artifact and feature attributes.

Until ~2500 rcya ago Panama harboured small social groups with a simple material culture
even though farming was established there long before. Subsequently, as new technologies
appear and populations congregate in villages, the mortuary record reflects occupational,
status, and rank distinctions. Symptomatic of such developments are sumptuary and costume
items: lapidary work, tumbaga, marine shells and animal products. Inspired by Warwick Bray's
elucidation of ancient and integrated exchange routes over an isthmian/Colombian "province," I
inquire how new field data from Panama concerning these crafts and exchange inform us about
the antiquity, breadth and complexity of social relations across this region.

a thorough examination of pillars at the Panteón de la Reina, a high-status cemetery site in

architecture and mark divisions between groups of graves. Uniform features on pillars suggest
that pillars were possibly used as pegged bases for statues made from perishable materials.

[19] Into the West: The Spread of Agriculture and the Beginnings of the Neolithic in Ireland and

The character of the archaeological evidence in Ireland led to demic diffusion continuing to be
seen as a useful explanation for agricultural origins when it had become largely redundant for
much of Britain. The concept of a slow take off of farming also appears to be of less relevance
in an Irish context. But we need to critically consider these island-wide generalizations and the
biomolecular, genetic and environmental evidence that supports the new explanatory climate.
Despite the range and diversity of relevant evidence many discussions of the transition still tend
to focus on one or other of the data sets, creating fragmentary and parallel narratives, quite
often constructed at very different geographical scales, to answer different questions. It is
argued here that should see the transition as a social process involving interwoven strands of
influence and change.

Prior to the introduction of trade copper in northwestern North America in the 18th century, native
copper (98-99+% pure) was highly prized among indigenous groups and circulated in an

are often credited as the main suppliers of copper in the region. This paper presents an overview

(2) identify new refits. This study helps gauge the model‘s robustness.

[143] Plant Foods in "Arid" Versus "Moist" Savannas, and the Relevance of

There is a fundamental difference between "moist savannas" in which some modern
chimpanzees live, and "arid savannas" which are not inhabited by chimpanzees, but in which
some East African Plio-Pleistocene hominins lived. A study of "arid savannas" in northern
Tanzania shows that common hominin plant foods are grasses, forb leaves, Acacia seeds/pods
and shrub fruits. Tree fruits of the type preferred by chimpanzees are available only in
groundwater forest, which is relatively rare in arid savannas. Therefore we should dismiss the
notion that Plio-Pleistocene East African hominins were tied to forests and tree fruits in a manner
similar to chimpanzees.

human populations from several geographical regions in the Caribbean area, pertaining to
different periods and cultural horizons. The Tainos from Cuba, Santo Domingo and Virgin Islands
always cluster together along with the Saladoids from Puerto Rico and the sample from
Guadaloupe. On the contrary, the Ciboneys from Cuba form another cluster together with the
preceramic sample of Cueva Roja from Hispaniola indicating that they share a common origin
during one of the earliest migration waves. Instead, no clear affinity emerges between the island
samples and those from Florida and Venezuela. The biological data from dental morphology
support the hypothesis of at least two different migratory waves in the peopling of the Caribbean
area.

Analysis was conducted on a sample of Ten Mile Creek pottery to determine paste variability

Sherd styles and tempers indicate a late Archaic through late prehistoric or early historic time

However, this did not preclude local manufacturing origins for the pottery. There are basic
compositional similarities between the clay and sandy and fiber-tempered pastes that might
indicate common regional manufacturing origins.

[202] Technological Lithic Traditions of the Central Amazon
Lithic analyses from samples from sites in the Central Amazon have identified two distinct
technological traditions, related to pre-ceramic and ceramic occupations. Pre-ceramic lithics are
associated to flaked bi-facial artifacts, including projectile points made from exotic raw materials,
dated to the early Holocene. Lithics from ceramic occupations date from 200 BC to AD 1500,
being made mostly from locally available sandstone, including bi-facial flaked and small-size
polished axes. Data show two interesting trends: bi-facial projectile points in the Amazon can
date from the early Holocene; flaked stone axes are compatible with a model of swidden
agriculture in fallow areas.

however, the present discourse suffers from essentialist interpretations of cultural interaction

[51] Variations in Late Intermediate Period Group Interaction in the Cusco Region (Peru)
Spanish chronicles describe pre-Inka sociopolitical organization in the Cusco region as highly
variable and early Inka interactions with neighboring groups as correspondingly complex. As the
Inka state developed and extended its territorial control, local groups were incorporated or co-
opted by means of alliance, intimidation, and military conquest. Regional settlement data
elucidate certain aspects of local social organization and the impacts of direct state
administration in previously autonomous areas. This paper uses new survey data to consider
interaction between the early Inka state and groups living to the west and northwest of the Cusco
Basin between AD 1000-1400.

Recent archaeological investigations along the Missisquoi River and Missisquoi Bay have

Investigations at San Bartolo continue to yield evidence for the use of ceremonial practice for
the maintenance of social, political, and spiritual order. The evidence from Structure 63, a Late
Classic shrine, indicates the community‘s desire for direct communication with the gods.
Activities at this structure include the offering and burning of what now amounts to over 9000
sherds, all centered around a barrigon. The evidence from Structure 63 also suggests that the
current terminology used in Maya archaeology falls short of addressing the idea of ―offering‖ in
comprehensive manner, and thus restricts our understanding of ancient Maya ritual behavior.

Discerning palimpsest reoccupation events is extremely difficult and requires integration of
multiple datasets. Applying GIS-based techniques to documentation and analysis of a Late-
Terminal Archaic pithouse we illustrate methods for effective recording and description of
reoccupation episodes. The pithouse‘s basal occupation levels represent the earliest evidence of
reduced residential mobility encountered in the region thus far. The structure continued to be
reoccupied for an extended period and during the Terminal Archaic it was converted into a facility
used for a variety of other purposes but remained an important element in the community‘s

[133] Relating Toolstone Curation to Mobility: Exploring a GIS Approach
Archaeologists generally agree that there is a strong relationship between mobility and the
organization of technology. During the Paleoarchaic period in the Great Basin, for example,
shifts in the proportions of local and extralocal toolstone sources in assemblages are
hypothesized to have been the result of a decrease in mobility. We have shown previously that
these changes are consistent with transport costs estimates derived from GIS modeling. We
anticipate, as well, corresponding shifts in tactics relating to the curation of higher quality
sources. Here we evaluate this hypothesis through an examination of alternative measures of
tool resharpening.

[168] Late Archaic Regional Organization in the Norte Chico, Peru
There is now evidence of approximately 30 major ceremonial and residential centers dating to
the Late Archaic (3000 to 1800 BC) period in the four valleys of the Norte Chico region. There
are no signs of a distinct hierarchy of these sites in terms of overall size or the number or size of
monumental structures. There is also radiocarbon evidence that most of these sites were
occupied contemporaneously during period from 2400 to 2000 BC. This paper explores the idea
that these centers represented relatively independent polities engaged in peer-to-peer
competition for religious participants and labor.

[84] Colonization, Population Expansion and Complexity in the Northern Lesser Antilles
The northern Lesser Antilles were permanently colonized by large groups of sedentary fisher-
farmers around 500 BC, following initial occupation by smaller, more transient groups of
Preceramic Age fisher-gatherers during the previous 1000 years. Populations appear to have
grown steadily from this point, with the greatest increase during the late Ceramic Age between
ca. AD 900-1200. The timing and extent of colonization and expansion may correlate with
reconstructed climatic trends. More importantly, however, the development of greater social
complexity is argued to be central to the sustainability of increased populations across a full
range of small island environments.

Pottery samples from the Oaxaca Barrio at Teotihuacan were analyzed using polarizing

I analyze 85 vessels depicting human forms, gaining insight into the social organization of

that females were not present in ceramic art in the Early Nasca Phase but were prevalent
during the Middle and Late Phases. I suggest an intensification of warfare as an explanation
for the rapid incorporation of females into the iconography. Warfare heightened the
importance of the female role in procreation and allowed females to fill social roles typically
occupied by males.

[111] Embodied Evidence: Archaeology and Exhumation
The immediacy of recent exhumation contrasts with the excavation of more ancient human
remains, in that it produces corpses that are remembered or remember-able as individuals. The
treatment of the body through excavation recognises some bodies after death as more suitable
to be identified, remembered, mourned, exhumed and reburied. This paper considers the ways in
which the materiality of the corpse is constituted through the performative acts of excavation and
analysis, suggesting that the conflict that often surrounds the work of recent exhumation reveals
the usually hidden beliefs about the body that are wrapped up with the excavation of human
remains.

[189] Maya Domestic Economies at Chau Hiix, Belize
This paper investigates links between polity and economy through the organization and change
of Maya household economic activities from the Classic to Postclassic Periods. Average Maya
households were stable agriculturalists whose subsistence production contrasted with the volatile
political economy of elites. Transition in Lowland Maya society from the Classic to Postclassic is
marked by the breakup of complex, state-level, political hierarchies. This paper evaluates
evidence of botanical and material remains from Maya households at Chau Hiix, Belize, from
Late Classic and Early Postclassic contexts to better understand domestic economies in the
Classic period, and their response to political upheavals.

[44] Demographic Artifacts of the Radiocarbon Calibration Curve: Implications for Identifying
     Mechanisms of Social Transformation
Archaeologists working on the Northern Channel Islands commonly use changing frequency of
radiocarbon-dated components through time as a proxy for demographic change. Fluctuations
in the number of dated components have been interpreted as demographic changes in
response to climatic instability, introduction of disease, or social transformation. However,
variation in atmospheric 14C production can account for some of these perturbations. We have
modeled component frequencies assuming the regular creation of datable archaeological
carbon. This model demonstrates that variability in the calibration curve reproduces several of
these fluctuations, necessitating a re-evaluation of the underlying processes contributing to
cultural development in the region.

Chunchucmil, a specialized trade center in NW Yucatan, is one of the very largest Classic Maya
cities. Its extraordinary density necessitated well-defined streets and boundary walls that clearly
separated private from public spaces. Chunchucmil's public spaces also lacked the large, civic-
religious monuments that one is led to expect of large Maya cities. It was also a true city with
well-developed prestige and commodity markets. These and other features provide a view of
Classic Maya cities that is not possible elsewhere, particularly of the interplay between
cooperation and competition that structured the built environment and constrained authoritarian
power.

[78] Household Archaeology on Unalaska Island, Alaska: The First 7000 Years
Domestic structures from Unalaska in the eastern Aleutians have been documented from 9000
BP to the contact period. Late prehistoric period houses are well known, but until recently much
less was identified from earlier periods. A series of excavations over the last 10 years at the
Uknadok, Margaret Bay, Amaknak Bridge and Summer Bay sites have revealed a variety of
house types with numerous floor artifacts which span the first 7000 years of the Aleutian
sequence. By 3000 BP large, multiroomed, stone-lined semi-subterranean houses with elaborate
sub floor features had appeared and may reflect increased social complexity.

[146] Stressed Out: The Role of Cultural and Natural Resources Management in Sustainable
      Development in Northwest Honduras
Sustainable development in Central America usually entails economic growth through
mechanisms that aim to preserve and protect finite natural resources. Archaeological remains,
as finite cultural resources, rarely enter the equation unless economic development is tied to
tourism. This paper presents the results of on-going applied archaeological research in
northwest Honduras that examines the ways in which rural agrarian communities manage
natural and cultural resources to deal with food and water insecurity caused by globalization
processes. Our work informs development initiatives by situating archaeological evidence in
broader debates about the sustainability of human/environment relations over long periods.

[138] Chemical Characterization of Chert and Fine-Grained Volcanic Artifact Source Materials in
      the Eastern Great Basin
Paleoarchaic (11,500 to 8,000 BP) inhabitants of the eastern Great Basin left behind tools made
primarily from three materials: obsidian, fine-grained volcanics, and chert. The majority of
volcanic rock sources have been identified and characterized. Trace element data from ICP-MS
analysis does not distinguish between various chert sources. However, preliminary major and
trace element data from XRF analysis show that some of the chert sources are chemically
uniform and can be distinguished from other sources. The potential of chert characterization is
considered in light of prehistoric material selection patterns and previous provenance studies of
fine-grained volcanic and obsidian sources.

[247] Mixing Your Metaphors: Raw Material Choice, Tradition and Identity in Twentieth
      Century Cretan Pottery Manufacture
The ethnographic study of 52 kiln sites within East Crete reveals a rich picture of raw material
choice and manipulation in pottery manufacture. Adherence to recipes, according to the origins
of the potter, overrides most anticipated functional requirements of vessels types ranging from
1.5 m. tall storage jars to small water containers. The mobility of potters marrying outside their
communities, and the subsequent change in their shape repertoire highlight this deliberate
reproduction of their own trademark clay mixes. We examine the archaeological implications of
these jealously preserved practices, which serve as a vehicle for identity and rivalry amongst
Cretan potters.

What led to the rise of the Bassar Chiefdom of Togo? The passage of large, long-distance Hausa

emphasize these economic factors. Such models may apply in many parts of the world, including
the rise of the Western Sudanic States that controlled the trans-Saharan gold trade, but they do
not apply to the Bassar chiefdom. Its rise resulted from the secondary impacts of regional slave
raiding --the need to solve political problems resulting from the aggregation of heterogeneous
refugee populations fleeing the slave-raiders.

[3] Demographic Changes, Sociopolitical Development, and the Organization of Salt Production
    during the Postclassic Period in the Basin of Mexico
By the Late Postclassic period, salt had become a standardized measure of exchange and its
production a specialized craft carried out primarily on the shores of Lake Texcoco. Many
important questions remain unanswered regarding the organization of salt production and its
relationship to broader demographic and sociopolitical changes through time. Using a GIS, this

     Techniques
The sophistication and artistry of the Saladoid lapidary industry in the Early Ceramic Age of the
Caribbean is remarkable. The methods of production for these lapidary items were investigated
through the exploration of one aspect of bead manufacture, drilling technology. We specifically
focussed on a collection of stone beads from several Saladoid sites on Antigua. The bore holes
of the beads were studied through a technique in which a cast and then mould of the bore was
made. The mould was then examined for manufacturing traces through scanning electron
microscopy. Results were interpreted through comparison with experimentally drilled materials.

[51] Moving on Up: High Altitude Settlement Patterns in the Southern Vilcanota River Valley
     during the Late Intermediate Period
Peru‘s Southern Vilcanota River Valley witnessed an explosion of settlements into high altitude
regions during the Late Intermediate Period. Some archaeologists correlate similar LIP
occupations elsewhere with a need for increased defensibility. While not discounting this
interpretation for all areas of the Andes, I argue that it is not the best model for understanding
Late Intermediate Period settlement pattern in this region. I suggest that in order to understand
this movement to the heights one must also take into account changes in environmental
conditions and economic strategies as well as people‘s symbolic and ritual interactions with their
landscape.

Konop. One unusual aspect of the organization is that office holders are supported by the
community which presents a very different picture than the ―leveling function‖ often attributed to
the cargo system. This suggests a model in which the appropriation of religious office could
easily become the basis of social hierarchy.

institutionalise, facilitate, and sometimes limit agency over the longer term.

[85] Rationality, Power, and Wealth in the European Iron Age
Traditional societies often invent mechanisms that avoid the accumulation of riches and the

boar‘s teeth, which were broken up before closing their tombs. In the European Iron Age, we
observe that periods with very rich tombs, such as VIth and the IVth centuries BC, precede
times in which power is less manifest. When the first proto-states emerged in the course of the
IInd century, one does not find any such rich tombs anywhere. The elites have found ways to
keep their accumulating riches.

Unlike Ramah metachert, raw material quarries are rarely identified as important places in
Eastern Arctic. However in every region, Palaeoeskimo groups searched local stones to

equally valued to chert. This is particularly true for Diana quartzite found at Kangiqsualuk. We
thus describe the activities carried out and their relation to regional scale activities to define
the site function. Accordingly, studying a quarry site helps shed light on past groups'
movements which were not only tied to game migration but to stone procurement as well.

to possible impacts upon heritage tourism. Through a series of public meetings, a compromise
was met wherein the visual impact of backfilling was mitigated by a process of a community-

The faunal analysis conducted on the Chevelon Ruin material focused on defining and identifying
the ritual aspects of the assemblage. A life-history approach was used to analyze the material by
developing models for ritual and non-ritual taxa. This life-history approach involved information
on acquisition, processing, use, and disposal of the animal using ethnographic and ecological
literature. This resulted in two flow models for the life-history of animals as food and for animals
as ritual/ceremonial paraphernalia. After identifying the ritual deposits based on these criteria,
changes in ritual behavior over time were examined.

[85] The Rise and Rall of Iberian Copper Age Lineages
Lineage structures, the dominant social institution of Copper Age Iberia, were key to third
millennium socioeconomic developments, leaving a rich and diverse archaeological record. By
the end of the Copper Age household units played an increasingly important role as decision
making loci. The contradiction between lineages and emerging individual household interests
resulted in the subversion of the structuring principles underpinned social stability. The fall of
lineage dominance gave households a cornerstone role in subsequent Bronze Age societies.
While the Copper Age can only be understood through the analysis of collective action, Bronze
Age Iberia requires a household-oriented archaeology.

[197] The Flintknapper's Fallacy
Understanding the processes involved in manufacturing stone tools has become one of the
central concerns in lithic research and is the focus of both American approaches to lithic
reduction and the French one known as chaîne opératoire. Both approaches rest, however, on
one extremely important assumption, namely that archaeologists are able to recognize what was
the intended result, or desired end product. This paper discusses some of the problems that we
face in identifying what those end products are, and in turn, how misidentification can lead to
faulty reconstructions of technological processes.

Seeds, Roots, Shoots, and Fruits: Panama Archaeobotany and Pre-Columbian Crop Dispersals
[102] The Isthmus of Panama forms a relatively narrow land bridge between North and South
America, and was a major crossroads for the human spread of domesticated plants in the past.
Several decades of archaeobotanical research in Panama, particularly on microfossils, have
produced evidence for the early Holocene introduction of domesticates such as maize (Zea
mays), manioc (Manihot esculenta), squash (Cucurbita sp.), yam (Dioscorea trifida), and
arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea). When combined with phylogenetic studies identifying
ancestral populations, and archaeobotanical data from other parts of the Neotropics, this
evidence contributes significantly to reconstructing patterns of pre-Columbian crop dispersals
throughout the Americas.

The Lenkiteng site (GnJm38) is a buried lithic component exposed in a cut bank of a tributary of

stratigraphic history of our study area. Tools, cores and debitage, generally referable to the
Later Stone Age, are made of basalt, quantize, chert and obsidian. Formal analysis and
microscopic use wear study suggests the frequency of occurrence of the various raw materials
at the site is determined by local availability rather than material properties.

[119] Turquoise: Prized Gem Stone --Or Did They Fake It??
Considerable confusion has arisen over blue green stones that decorate the finery of elites in
Postclassic Mexico, and points south. Turquoise can be identified by its chemical signature, and
today researchers are asking what is, and what is not, turquoise. The implications are far-
reaching as the sources of the best grade turquoise are located in the American Southwest and
would have been conveyed over extremely long distances of dangerously rugged terrain and
hostile inhabitants to the places of manufacture and use. We examine the evidence and
implications for this most exotic of fine raw material, and suggest the market was open to

[43] Complexity, Canoes, and Shell Tools in South Florida
The political domination of south Florida in the sixteenth century by complex hunter-gatherers
like the Calusa depended on elite access to large numbers of watercraft. The roots of this
dominion lay in the intensification of canoe manufacturing and the organized production of the
shell tools needed to make them. I attempt to identify these changes, and thus the origins of
chiefly political organization, by tracking the production and use of shell tools in south Florida. My
analysis of woodworking tools and byproducts from over 100 archaeological sites reveals the
timing and epicenter of this critical turning point in southeastern prehistory.

[111] Colonialism and Bodily Practices: Consumption, Contestation, and Colonial Subjectivity
The body is a primary target and agent of colonialism, and bodily practices are a fundamental
site of struggle and vector of social transformation. This is why such things as foodways,

seeking to understand the operation of colonialism and its often unintended consequences.
This paper employs examples from ethnographic research in Kenya and archaeological
excavations in France to demonstrate the relationship between cuisine, the use of space, and
colonialism and how bodily practices both reveal the location of agency and are implicated in
the construction of colonial subjectivity.

A close examination of published accounts of forensic anthropology reveals a generally

the history and current state of forensic archaeology in the US will be reviewed. Baselines,

The hypothesis that the earliest colonization of the Americas occurred using watercraft along the
southern coast of Beringia and the northwest coast of North America rests on dating geological
events, human remains, artifacts, and paleoenvironmental events. While the mid-continent of
northern North America remained blocked by ice until 13,000 BP, refugia, islands, glaciated
areas of the continental shelf along the Northwest Coast were ice-free by 16,000 BP.
Deglaciation along the northwest coast had begun by 16,800 cal. BP and was sufficiently
advanced to enable humans using watercraft to colonize coastal areas by 15,350 BP.

[201] More Bang for Your Buck!!!! Reclaiming Agency from the Study of Metal Artefacts
Microstructural characterisation is a routine task in the "processing" of metal finds. The
interpretive potential of microstructural data remains underdeveloped because it derives from a
methodology that fetishizes artefacts and is practiced by investigators who fail to theorise their
own practice. Through combining ethnography with archaeological evidence from the Aegean it
is argued that the practice of banging can be central to the reconsideration of microstructural
data. It is argued that metallurgical practice can be seen to be embedded in a symbolic scheme
which makes parallel references to the transformation of the individual, society and the natural

      Hopewellian Manifestation

the way in which Hopewellian concepts were variously adopted by small, mobile, hunter-

A truism of archaeology has been that only centralized, stratified, fully agricultural complex

presence of such structures as proof of an agricultural state. But the growing world

explore alternatives to organizing and feeding complex societies that make and use

[48] Paleoenvironmental Investigations near San Bartolo, Peten, Guatemala: 2005
Paleoenvironmental investigations were initiated around San Bartolo in 2005.
Geoarchaeological excavations were undertaken in several bajos in the area. One small bajo
produced clear evidence of having transformed from a perennial wetland into a seasonal
swamp during the Maya Preclassic; data from the other bajos are more varied and problematic.
Evidence of significant environmental instability was also recovered in excavations along small
stream channels. Excavation and coring in three aguadas revealed considerable differences in
their use and maintenance as water sources.

[153] Pondering Provenance and Technology: Chemical Characterization of Copper Age Daub,
      Ceramics, and Raw Material Sources in Southeastern Hungary
Chemical and mineralogical investigations indicate that although clay is relatively homogeneous
across the Great Hungarian Plain, there is enough micro-variation to begin to understand the
provenance of ceramic vessels and architectural daub. This project examines the trace chemical
composition of pottery, daub, and clay raw material across the Körös Region using laser
ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) to delineate the feasibility
of interpreting networks of exchange and mobility. A secondary goal compares daub and pottery
to understand the chaîne opératoire, or technological sequence, in architectural and potting uses
of clay resources.

[156] Divide and Rule! How the Classic Maya Kingdom of Dos Pilas Became a Regional Power
The Classic Maya kingdom of Dos Pilas was founded during the seventh century AD and it
became within two generations a regional power with wide influence in the Maya lowlands.
Recent research at the site of Dos Ceibas south of Aguateca, the twin capital of Dos Pilas,
suggests the presence of a royal administrator. The royal court of Dos Pilas was likely only the
hub of regional hierarchy of administrators and semi-autonomous nobles. It cannot be reduced
to its material setting -- palaces and temples at a capital --but must be understood from a
regional perspective.

[69] Advances in Methodology for Architectural Analysis: The Case from Piñami, a Middle
      Horizon Site in Cochabamba, Bolivia
In this paper new standardized methods for architectural analysis are presented and applied
using data from excavations at the site of Piñami, a long-term habitation mound in Cochabamba,
Bolivia. The intention is to develop a single approach to document design and construction
techniques applicable to a wide variety of architectural features. Use of these procedures at
Piñami demonstrate the value of this methodology to highlight comparative data between
architectural forms over time. The theoretical strength of this methodology is that it provides a
standardized language for detailed architectural analysis useful in any archaeological site type,
geographic region or time period.

[75] The Mimbres Kachina Cult Revisited
I revisit Carlson's suggestion that aspects of katsina ceremonialism was present among the
Mimbres, some 200 years prior to when this religion is believed to have originated among the
Pueblo peoples. While Carlson focused on iconography, I examine other aspects of pottery
design, color combinations, and architectural features. I argue that the suite of attributes
associated with katsina ceremonialism in the Western Pueblo region is also present in the
Mimbres area. As such, archaeologists need to address how we identify the katsina religion
archaeologically and/or the temporal gap between similarities in material culture from the
Mimbres and Western Pueblo regions.

Excavations during the 2005 field season at the presumed Middle Horizon site of Collota,
located in Cotahuasi Canyon, Perú yielded interesting and unexpected results. Most notably
the temporal position of the site, based previously on architectural clues consistent with Wari
architectural canon, appears to have been misdiagnosed. The structure can now be more
securely attributed to the Late Horizon. This paper reports results from the excavations,
discusses the broader anthropological implications of these data, and poses possible
explanations for what appears to be a deliberate architectural referent to earlier times in a
remote province of the Inca Empire.

[211] Interdisciplinary? Historians, Archaeologists, and the Interpretive Challenges Posed by
       Early Medieval Mortuary Customs
During the past thirty years, scholars of early medieval mortuary rites have recognized the
necessity of adopting multi-disciplinary approaches in order to view as a whole the fragmentary
evidence. This response, while slow in coming, has brought about important changes in the way
in which burial sites are studied, the remains collected and processed, and ultimately their
significance interpreted. Yet, interdisciplinary research is not without its own pitfalls, and scholars
have become increasingly wary of making assumptions about the reliability of evidence
processed in fields outside their areas of expertise. This paper will outline some of the current
and historic challenges facing early medieval specialists and how scholars have sought to
accommodate and/or adapt to these altered circumstances.

In recent years, archaeologists have dislodged many entrenched ideas and contributed much
new scholarship concerning how and why native peoples sought out and used copper-base
metal objects offered to them by Europeans. Questions about this material's role in native life
and in post-contact change have taken center stage. In this paper, I examine how the over 6,000
copper-base metal artifacts recovered from the Iliniwek Village, Clark County, Missouri (mid-
seventeenth-century Illinois) are distributed over the site. Findings are integrated with
ethnohistoric evidence to shed light on social processes of consumption, including selection,
appropriation, transformation, circulation, even rejection of this important metal.

This paper presents a comparative, quantitative analysis of site planning principles and the
integration of Classic Maya urban centers and surrounding settlement zones. This investigation
utilizes GIS databases from several large centers to assess and revise current models of Maya
urban form and function. With these data, I will examine the distribution of various types of
residential, administrative, and public features outside site epicenters. The results of this analysis
challenge some common conceptions about the demography, status hierarchy, and integrative
features in large Maya centers. These findings have implications for understanding how urban
zones functioned as administrative, religious, and economic centers.

[158] Understanding the Social Organization of Maguey Processing in the Malpaso Valley,
       Zacatecas, Mexico, AD 500-900
Macrobotanical analyses demonstrate that the inhabitants of the Malpaso Valley of northwest
Mexico utilized maguey, although the social organization of its production and use remains
unclear. We examine tools and botanical materials related to maguey use recovered from a
variety of the valley‘s sites, representing a range of social contexts. Specifically, we use residue
analyses and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) to identify the presence of maguey in
primary and secondary refuse contexts. Considered in the valley‘s larger paleoecological
context, these lines of evidence yield new insights about maguey production at various levels of
the valley‘s social hierarchy.

Tephra/sediment studies reveal local environmental changes from 8000 years ago to present.
Throughout this time, caldera contained a seasonal pond, potentially influencing the human and
wildlife site use. Although variations rainfall are significant, regional soil/vegetation changes were
primarily influenced by tephra deposition, erosion and re-deposition. Region-wide climatic
change may have influenced expansion of populations into volcanic mesa lands.

[10] Health Effects of the Han Dynasty Collapse on a Peripheral Population in Northeast China
Following the Han Dynasty (206 BC-AD 220) collapse, many non-Chinese tribes fought for
rulership in northern China. Bioarchaeological analysis of nearly 500 individuals who lived
during this period in the peripheral northeast provides insight into the physiological effects of
political upheaval, and also the health consequences of a shift to an agricultural lifestyle upon a
formerly pastoral population. While grave goods such as horse-riding equipment and
implements of farming and warfare offer perspective into their lives, skeletal markers of
stresses experienced during childhood, and through dietary deficiencies, trauma, and
osteoarthritis give testament to the health challenges this population faced.

[135] Refitting Bones: Negative Evidence, Site Structure and Social Organization
Bone refitting and individual carcass re-assembling can inform us about technological
processes of prey carcass treatment, including transport, butchering and consumption.
Moreover, spatial aspects of consumption patterns can lend insight into economic and social
organization. The relative position of the archaeological site in the sequence from acquisition to
discard may largely determine the probability for meaningful mechanical, articulating and
bilateral refitting of faunal skeletal elements. Presence or absence of such refits may help us in
determining that relative position of the site across the landscape. Examples from the late
Upper Paleolithic are used to explore site function and demography.

The Late Intermediate Period (ca. AD 1000-1450) is characterized as a time of relatively
isolated local polities. New research on the north-central coast suggests greater interaction
between "local societies" than has been recognized. Widespread similarities in material culture
have masked evidence of social and political tensions in this region. Investigations at Acaray
(Huaura Valley) test the proposition that interaction between the Central Coast, Huaura
groups, and North Coast polities involved conflict. This paper presents data from Acaray that
addresses the nature of these regional relationships. I emphasize that a multiscalar approach
is crucial to understanding both macro-regional and local histories.

[185] Geochemical Traces of Landscape Change in the Ben Lawers Area of the Scottish
      Highlands
The Ben Lawers Historic Landscape study is a multi-disciplinary project to investigate the
evolution of the Loch Tay cultural landscape. A mid-eighteenth century survey reveals a
landscape of settlements with associated arable infields/outfields. Establishing the location of
settlement prior to the eighteenth century is challenging because of the perishable character of
turf-based buildings. The infield lay close to the main settlements, developing from older areas of
cultivation. Given the high level of nutrient transfers onto arable we might expect evidence of
anthropogenic modification, with older areas of cultivation potentially showing greater impact.
The results of soil geochemical analyses are presented.

index. In this paper we demonstrate this point by presenting different reduction indices calculated
for both an experimental assemblage and a sample from the La Colombiere Perigordian

Wetlands are among the most fragile and biologically diverse environments. Pre-Columbian

aquatic landscape through a coordinated program of regional-scale engineering. Through the
lens of historical ecology, key elements of the technology that are embedded in the landscape
palimpsest can be recovered. By creating a complex interface of terrestrial and aquatic micro-
topography and hydraulic infrastructure, farmers efficiently managed seasonal water resources
and harnessed solar energy for subsistence and surplus production. The complex cultural
patterning of these anthropogenic landscapes demonstrates human agency, intentionality, and
sophisticated indigenous knowledge.

smugglers. This paper will outline specific modifications made to ships used for smuggling and
carrying illicit goods that could distinguish them from merchant vessels. Once identified, these
modifications will be compared to excavated colonial Caribbean shipwrecks to determine the

The Danilo Bitinj site is located in Danilo Polje, an elongate karstic valley in coastal Croatia. The

Mediterranean moisture regime (with cool, wet winters and hot, dry summers) and the local
predominance of fine-grained sediments provide that these soils currently retain sufficient
moisture for year-round plant growth. This moisture retention may have enabled the site to
remain productive prehistorically in times of resource stress. The current study aims to inform
interpretation of both site formation processes and paleoenvironmental conditions through
analysis of soil biophysical properties.

[240] A Comparison of the Spatial Distribution of Agriculture and Craft Specialization in Four
       Regions
The long-term evolution of states and complexity in human societies creates demand for labor
and surplus production. These new demands, in turn, stimulate household and regional
economic changes, including agricultural intensification, demographic change, change in land
tenure, urbanization, and craft specialization. In this paper, I construct a geo-economic model of
these changes based on the comparison of four cases, from England, France, Central Mexico,
and the Valley of Oaxaca. The resulting model predicts the development of a regional division

[122] Integrating the Documentary and Material Records of the California Missions
The Spanish in California left a detailed textual record of their economic accomplishments but a
limited, highly biased, record of the Native Americans in their mission system. Analysis of
economic records, combined with missionaries‘ letters, has allowed reconstruction of changing
Spanish goals regarding the Native Americans between 1769-1834 while the mission system
operated. This was then used to examine the material record from archaeological excavations
at mission sites, especially Mission Soledad, to identify arenas of daily life in which Native
Americans complied with or resisted the Spanish as they strove to maintain their identity and
cultural heritage.

[21] Sicán Women: Interpretations of Status, Health, and Violence
Fifty two adult females from the Middle Sicán Capital (CE 1100) and the Sicán affiliated El Brujo
site were examined for pathologies related to occupational health and trauma. Several healed
blunt trauma cranial lesions were found at both sites. Hand and foot pathologies were quite
common especially among women who appear to be non-local. Different degrees of healing of
traumas were noted by social class, with commoners showing the lowest degree of healed
fractures. The paleopathological evidence suggests that violence against women was present
regardless of class, but that degree of healing and survival likelihood was influenced by social
class.

[210] Ahead of Its Time: "Postclassic" Highland Deities in Copan Architectural Sculpture
The sculptured facades of several prominent buildings in Copan display numerous highland
deity motifs that reappear centuries later in Postclassic cultures of the Basin of Mexico. These
large and numerous elements represent a paradox because some appear to make their first
appearance in Late Classic Maya sculpture, one hundred years after the demise of
Teotihuacan. Their close similarities with later Postclassic Mexican sculptures suggest that
pilgrims and merchants from the central highlands continued to visit Copan. The architectural
sculpture of the "Tollan of the East" may have served as a source of inspiration for Postclassic
artisans.

[66] Roots of Human Diversity in the New World: The Distributions of the Earliest Sites
Averaged radiometric data from 40 sites producing two or more samples each suggest early
human populations accumulated from three geographically disparate areas of the Western
Hemisphere after 12,500 BP. These areas include Alaska, the Southern Plains of North America,
and southwestern South America. The earliest of these archaeological sites are essentially
contemporaneous and they distinguish at least three separate problems of the early peopling
process, they suggest more potential cultural diversity than is usually considered, and they
increase the probability that pathways other than Beringia were taken for first entry into the

[247] A Comparative View of Human Influence on the Environment in the Collapse of Ancient
      Complex Societies
In the discussion of societal collapse, explanations seesaw between polar camps that Smith and
Schreiber (in press) call environmentalists and culturalists. There is increasing scientific evidence
of cataclysmic environmental events that had impact on human complex societies. Cause and
effect of human behavior on climatic and environmental events are frequently confused or not
well articulated. A methodology is needed that operationalizes human political, technological,
economic and social decisions that precipitated collapse or mitigated environmental effects.
Using a comparative approach, this paper will review several case studies and suggest
approaches for investigating human action and reaction to environmental events affecting
collapse.

[44] A New Understanding of Obsidian Hydration
Obsidian hydration dating (OHD) is based on the premise that when an obsidian artifact is
manufactured the fresh surface exposed immediately begins to hydrate. Unfortunately, surface
concentrations may not equilibrate at room temperature for hundreds or thousands of years, and
diffusion coefficients are compositionally dependent. "Self-stress," caused by the in-diffusing
species, plays an important role. SIMS analysis of H and O, however, clearly suggests that only
the hydrogen from water enters the glass at lower temperatures, not oxygen. Applications of new
analytical approaches and experimental data to chronology and paleoclimatology have shown
the potential applicability of this new approach.

must employ finer categories and implement more multi-dimensional measures than just
egalitarian-stratified or a series of neo-evolutionary modes. Although perhaps better known for
his significant contributions to archaeological chemistry and domestication, T. Douglas Price has
fostered major advances in the ways that we examine inequality and socioeconomic
differentiation. These breakthroughs are highlighted and amplified here.

Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of ceramic sherds from eight prehistoric sites
(ca. AD 400-1500) on the island of Carriacou in the West Indies reveals that there are at least
two main compositional groups. This may be a reflection of prehistoric potters selecting clays
that derive from either the island's volcanic substrate or limestone substrate. Petrographic
analysis of a separate suite of sherds from six of the same sites indicates that there are at least
eight temper groups, some of which appear to be indigenous to Barbados and South America

[6] Managing for Maaori Cultural Landscapes: A Case Study from the Waikato Region of New
     Zealand
This poster explores cultural heritage management in Aotearoa/New Zealand with specific
reference to the management of Māori archaeological sites and sites of significance. Issues to be
considered include: 1) defining and legislating cultural heritage concepts, 2) assessing the value
of cultural heritage, 3) private versus public land ownership, 4) expressing and exercising
kaitiakitanga and tino rangatiratanga, 5) determining the quality of local and regional authority
plans and policies, 6) measuring cultural heritage outcomes, and 7) successful methods for
tangata whenua and local council collaboration.

[67] Mixtec Polychrome Ceramics from Tututepec, Oaxaca, Mexico: New Contexts and
     Considerations
Mixtec Polychrome pottery, particularly that loosely dubbed "codex style," has repeatedly been
cited in discussions of elite interaction in Late Postclassic Oaxaca. Inferences that these
materials were essentially restricted to elites are problematic in that they have relied on little
sound contextual data from archaeological excavations. Data are presented here from
excavations at two residences from the Postclassic center of Tututepec. Though limited in
scope geographically, the contexts and iconographic subjects of ceramic materials considered
potentially raise new questions concerning the circulation of ideology and relations between
polychromes and other forms of ideological media in the Postclassic Mixteca.

[148] Mindscapes and Virtual Ecosystems
The Virtual Heritage Lab of CNR has conducted several multidisciplinary projects aimed to
reconstruct archaeological landscapes using digital technologies in such places as Peru, Syria,
Ethiopia, and Italy. The main focus of these projects is to reconstruct spatial relations of the
landscape using spatial anthropology and cybernetics, supported by digital immersive
technologies. The theory of mindscape shows that virtual reality is a key factor for the
reconstruction of ancient mental maps because it involves the way we, as humans, perceive
information through time. The process of re-creating virtual and mind landscapes, educates
students and scholars on many, varied levels.

[176] Coastal Geomorphology, Archaeological Site Formation, and Settlement Patterns: A
       Case Study from the East Coast of Puerto Rico
Coastlines are geomorphically active and sensitive to global and local processes. Sea-level
changes, tectonic activity, and climatic events impact coastlines/areas. Humans occupying these
places must cope with short and long-term processes/events. Residues of human activities are
also subjected to geomorphic processes. It is important to understand these processes for
specific contexts when addressing archaeological site formation and reconstructing past
settlement systems and coastal paleogeography. We address the geomorphic context of HU-7, a
pre-Columbian site located on the east-central coast of Puerto Rico. Geomorphology,
sediments/soil development, and catastrophic climatic events are investigated to understand the
burial context. Strategies for identifying/recording archaeological sites in coastal settings are
discussed.

[216] The Conquest-Period Obsidian Industry of Ciudad Vieja, El Salvador
Ciudad Vieja, the ruins of the first villa of San Salvador, occupied 1528-1545, was inhabited by a
large indigenous Mesoamerican population. They continued to use obsidian implements after the
Conquest, but a drastic change occurred in the patterns of procurement and manufacture of
these implements. No evidence exists that obsidian tools were produced on site. The pattern of
evidence presented indicates that prismatic blades were imported ready-made for sale or barter
at the town. In less than a generation after the Conquest, a highly specialized skill was lost, and
ancient trade and exchange patterns were greatly altered forever.

[27] The Supplicant‟s Road: Symbol and Metaphor in Pueblo Prehistory
As symbols both materialized and imagined, roads are prominent in the religion and cosmology
of the historic Pueblo peoples of the American Southwest. Prayers, ritual practitioners, water,
spiritual beings, the Sun and Moon—all are known to travel along carefully designated and,
often, physically marked roads or pathways. The duly famous Chacoan roads document this
aspect of Pueblo ceremonialism in prehistory; however, in this paper I suggest that the
pervasiveness of road imagery in the archaeological record more broadly has been
underappreciated. Using Eastern Pueblo data, I argue for the importance of road concepts within
prehistoric Southwestern communities.

[7] The Persistence of Village-Scale Society on the Southern Altiplano
Archaeologists have often viewed ―Neolithic‖ societies as representing a stage in the emergence
of complex societies. Alternatively, agency-oriented archaeologists have considered early
villages the matrix within which individuals and factions compete. Most such studies focus on
regions where complex polities emerged, and question how and why they developed. This paper
examines a persistent village settlement system of the southern altiplano. Analysis is focused on
understanding how and why the development of socio-economic and political inequality was
inhibited in this region of the Andes. The Wankarani database is compared with models and
trajectories developed elsewhere.

Until recently it was thought that cattle were not part of the Cypriot Neolithic "Noah's ark." Recent

they seem to have been exploited for only a short time before being abandoned, until they were
reintroduced as an important part of the Bronze Age economy and culture. In this paper I will
examine the role of cattle in the Early Neolithic site of Akanthou-Talisu, in order to understand
what role cattle played in this society and why that role changed.

[148] GIS and Spatial Statistical Tools for Archaeological Work
Archaeologists often use a combination of survey and site catchment analysis in planning,
conducting, and managing excavations. Recently, archaeologists are seeing the utility of
employing a GIS to increase the efficiency and accuracy of their work; a companion set of
procedures, spatial statistics, appear to be scarcely employed. Hindering the adoption of
GIS/spatial statistics in teaching and field work is the lack of examples illustrating the utility of
GIS/spatial statistics compared to traditional methods. This presentation will illustrate the
effectiveness of geostatistical analysis procedures (variograms and kriging) and point pattern
analysis (spatial clustering) in site selection and future excavation strategies.

document these changes. I then tie the results to the previously defined cultural historical types

Carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of herbivore tooth enamel from Zhoukoudian, China
are used to reconstruct the paleodiet and paleoenvironment of mammals that occupied the site
during the Middle Pleistocene. δ13C values indicate that the proportion of C3 to C4 plants in the
diets of some animal increased over time, possibly suggesting more intense winters at this site.
δ18O trends are compared to shifts in the East Asian Winter Monsoon (EAWM), as evidenced by
the stacked loess record from China. Combined, these isotopes suggest that rapid intensification
of the EAWM may have been concurrent with site abandonment by Homo erectus.

heritage discourse. By promoting a democratic discourse centering on heritage, the project
seeks to increase the power of local community members to affect the course of gentrification in

followed by sudden departure and unemployment. Locals who formed the labor force for
archaeological excavations are usually excluded from subsequent phases of restoration, park

disaster. Alternative approaches to socially ethical archaeology are presented here. These are
based on culturally-sensitive community engagement to research design and simultaneous

[224] The San Diguito Complex at La Playa, Sonora
The finding of more than 1,000 lithic artifacts, as flakes, unifacial tools, choppers, hammers and
core tools showing different degrees of superficial alteration, on a late Pleistocene fluvial
channel and it subsequent analysis, had as result that it is an occupation of San Dieguito II
groups. This geographical location, northwest of Sonora state, modify the south boundary
established by Malcolm Rogers around the 90´s of the XX century, suggesting the great
territorial extension that this cultural complex had.

Con la llegada del Holoceno se acentua una progresiva mejoria climatica que tiene su correlato
en las transformaciones de la cobertera vegetal y por consiguiente de los ecosistemas
asociados. El devenir de los ultimos caza-recolectores, y el impacto de la introducción de las
nuevas estrategias economicas, constituyen uno de los ejes centrales a evaluar en este

[226] Explaining Ancient Technological Innovation in Coastal Southern Argentina (Santa Cruz
       Province)
This paper aims to explain changes in flaked stone technology during the Mid-Late Holocene
(6500 BP to AD 1850) by examining the prehistoric social organization of coastal hunter-
gatherers in Southern Argentina. It presents a case study evaluating a recently published model
of technological evolution – Ben Fitzhugh's 2001 risk sensitivity model of technological
innovation. It tests the idea that technological innovation is particularly manifest during times of
hardship (colonization, circumscription, intensification, and the emergence of social inequality).
The flaked stone assemblages from 17 archaeological sites were examined using a series of
flaked stone analyses to monitor technological innovations.

[99] Footprints of the Ancestors: Hopi Perspectives on Images in Stone
A collaborative project between Hopi elders, cultural specialists, teachers, and anthropologists,
attempts to bring Hopi traditional knowledge into the classrooms on the Hopi Reservation, by
building community based cultural curriculum and educational resource CD-ROM. Petroglyphs
and pictographs are an important part of that curriculum, because they draw a picture of the past
to the present and future generations. Looking at this subject from a native, historical,
ethnographic, and archaeological perspective, the presentation sheds light on the importance of
images in stone for Hopi people today and demonstrates how to apply that information to the
curriculum and resource CD-ROM.

[233] The Politics of Commerce: Marketplace Exchange and Imperial Competition in the Core of
the Aztec Empire
One important way that empires consolidate power is to undercut the traditional revenue
bases of subject elites and redirect resource flows into the imperial coffers. To this end,
Aztec imperial rulers implemented a strategy to divert and appropriate marketplace revenues
from subject elites throughout the Basin of Mexico. New and recent compositional studies of
Aztec ceramics suggest that Mexica rulers in Tenochtitlan managed to penetrate the market
domains of neighboring polities in the Basin, including their allies in Texcoco. Tenochtitlan‘s
emergence as the more powerful of the two centers may be in part due the apparent success
of this strategy.

[22] Geoprospection of Mound A, Etowah Mounds State Park, Georgia, 2001-2002
Mound A, located at Etowah Mounds State Park, Georgia, was the subject of a multi-sensor
geoprospection study in 2001-02. Mound A, a late prehistoric mound, built by the
Mississippian Culture, ca. 1250-1400 AD, is, due to its size, -1 ha in area at the base and
20m in height, a formidable subject for the use of shallow geoprospection techniques.
Techniques used were ground radar (GPR), conductivity (EM) and electrical (resistivity)
methods. Common Mid-Point (CMP) radar data produced detail on the mound interior from
surface to base. Electrical pesuo-sections produced excellent detail of the mound's interior.
The EM data appears relevant for only the upper half of the mound, perhaps to a depth of 10
m, and suggests significant heterogeneity in the sediment fill used in the mound's
construction. Our results speak directly to the efficacy of shallow geophysical techniques in
exploring large archeological mounds and tells. Another important aspect of this study is the
use of a geoprospection approach as a non-invasive methodology for characterizing
culturally sensitive archaeological sites.

[48] Defining Intersite Areas in the Northeast Peten, Guatemala
The nature of the vegetation and terrain in the Peten has limited ways in which intersite
investigations have been carried out. New technologies are changing the ways in which
survey are conducted in the tropical forest environment. This permits a redefinition of
intersite areas as we can now more closely approximate how these areas were delineated
and functioned over space and through time. Using the Xultun-San Bartolo intersite area as
an example this paper defines intersite areas based on topography and resource distribution
and outlines a sampling strategy for both survey and excavation programs based on this new
definition.

a small batey with petroglyphs, a midden on the slope below the batey, and a single structure on
a ridge nose to the south of the midden. This site was interpreted to be a nonresidential, local
ceremonial center that served a portion of the upper Cerrillos River Valley.

While historical documents provide some information on daily life in Ottoman Greece, many
details of this life and of the impact of imperial policies on average individuals remain unknown.
Stable carbon, nitrogen and oxygen isotope analyses of human bones and teeth from the
Ottoman cemeteries of Corinth and Mitilini offer us new insights into these issues. The results
suggest significant maize consumption by some individuals, possibly reflecting Ottoman
encouragement of maize cultivation. They also suggest movement of individuals from place to
place in the Empire, which would have been consistent with Ottoman policies on the relocation of
individuals and populations.

[64] Gender Complementarity and Separation in Maya Ritual
An ethnoarchaeological study of a Kanjobal Maya speaking community suggests that gender
relationships surrounding indigenous ritual, especially cave ritual, is far more complex than
suggested in previous literature. While women were prohibited from entering caves, unmarried
men were also denied entrance. At the same time long periods of sexual abstinence are required
of men before cave rituals. Much of community ritual is controlled by male alcalde rezadores.
The most important named position in the hierarchy, however, is held by a woman and this is
reflected by the preeminence of Mother Earth (Madre Tierra) in the indigenous pantheon.

[9] Postclassic Ceramics in the Soconusco: Patterns of Production and Exchange
The Soconusco region played an important role in long-distance exchange systems during the
Postclassic period as merchants brought goods produced elsewhere to the Soconusco to
exchange for the region's cacao. Imported goods such as copper, bronze, and obsidian have
been recovered during excavations at Postclassic sites in the Soconusco, and stylistic analysis
of ceramics indicates that Soconusco residents used ceramic vessels that are similar to
bichrome and polychrome ceramics found in other regions of Mesoamerica. To better
understand patterns of ceramic production and exchange, in this study we analyze Postclassic
Soconusco ceramics through laser ablation ICPMS to identify production centers.

[113] Sambaquis as Sacred Monuments: Ritual Moundbuilding at the Southern Coast of Brazil
Sambaquis (shellmounds) appear all along Brazilian Atlantic coast, getting monumental
magnitude towards the southern shores. No longer considered campsite remains from small
nomadic bands of shellfish collectors, these impressive mounds are taken today as expression of
dense sedentary societies. Recent investigations reveal recurrent ritual funerary procedures,
involving preparing, disposing and revisiting the ancestors, at the basis of incremental building
up of the mound, where food offerings and feasting are paramount features pointing to a great
social investment. Recurrence of ceremonial patterns over time (at least 6000 to 1700 BP) points
to long lived religious patterns among "complex" fishing-collecting societies.

stress on the natural appearance of kings‘ bodies has been interpreted, paradoxically, as
indicating their divinity. I suggest this innovation in visual representation reveals clues to notions
of embodied personhood, displaying the unity and action of the body. The king‘s person
became a naturalized symbol of totality, and his agency derived from his ability to encompass
social and cosmic divisions. The Maya ruler was comparable to the heroic kings of Polynesia
described by Marshall Sahlins, a sacred person whose actions unfold a collective history.

styles. These two points have implications for the kinds of agriculture practiced and the

The question of when and why the ancestors of the Athapaskan peoples of the Southwest and
Southern Plains left their homeland in northwest North America and what path these people
took on their journey south has long been debated. Their migration is incompletely understood
because the physical evidence in the archaeological record is minimal. However, recent
discoveries at archaeological sites in the Rocky Mountains and western High Plains
demonstrate a 15th century Athapaskan presence in this area. Advantageous cultural
adaptations and paleoenvironmental conditions facilitated proto-Apachean entry into Colorado,
and low regional population density allowed this entry to be relatively uncontested.

[239] My Island, Your Island, Our Islands: Considerations for Island Zooarchaeology as a
      Disciplinary Community
Zooarchaeologists working in island settings are united by special challenges and issues, yet
generally conduct research within geographic foci (eg. Oceania, Caribbean) whose boundaries
hinder collaboration between practitioners and limit united approaches toward addressing larger
questions in island archaeology. Here we call for greater dialogue and collaboration between
zooarchaeologists working in varied island settings and argue for the need of an island
zooarchaeology cooperative. We discuss the methodological and theoretical foundations
underpinning this proposed disciplinary community, including questions of data
collection/analysis, colonization, biodiversity and perceptions of insularity. We conclude with
suggestions for fostering dialogue and directions for future research.

[227] Smuggling as Unexceptional: "Illegal" Trade and the Limits of Colonial Control in the New
      Kingdom of Granada
This paper explores the establishment of smuggling in the provinces of Santa Marta and
Riohacha during the 16th century, highlighting how the flow of illegal goods contributed towards
the establishment of a different form of colonial order. While no less colonial in nature, it differed
greatly from the models produced by the metropolis and was perceived as a threat to effective
rule and economic monopoly. Nevertheless, smuggling played a crucial role in the survival of
these small colonies, and the inapplicability of laws against this activity established it as an
accepted social practice.

[162] The Chronological Context of Middle Paleolithic Deposits at Anghilak Cave, Uzbekistan
Previous reports concerning Anghilak cave have identified the deposits as Middle Paleolithic,
the faunal assemblage as primarily the result of hominid behavior, and the human metatarsal as
taxonomically non-diagnostic. Here we present data on the chronological context and a more
detailed analysis of the lithic assemblage. Relatively young AMS dates (27,000 14C BP-42,000
14C BP) were somewhat unexpected given the typical Mousterian character of the lithics.
Because these new dates represent some of the first from the region, interpretations of
Anghilak‘s assemblages shed light on the chronology and character of the Central Asian
Paleolithic, compared to better known Old World regions.

Late in his career Jim Hill became interested in the nature of archaeological site boundaries and
appropriate procedures for defining them. Although he wrote a lengthy paper on these topics, he
did not live long enough to see it published. Hill‘s interest in site boundaries reflects his long-
standing concern for rigor in generating data useful for comparisons. Somewhat unwittingly,
however, Hill exposed some fundamental issues relating to research design development and
the relationship between the archaeological record and human behavior. Hill‘s interest in site
boundaries, therefore, serves as vehicle for exploring tenets surrounding the practice of
archaeology.

known rates of demic and cultural diffusion. This comparison will help to evaluate competing
models emphasizing either the migration of farmers or the cultural diffusion of an agricultural
adaptation, and to note possible similarities.

Evidence for the manufacture of bone cores for cloth buttons found in association with 18th
century prisons and almshouses in the U.S. raises interesting questions. How did the residents
acquire and hand-process the bone? Were button cores made for commercial or personal use?
These questions were approached by experimentally processing a variety of skeletal elements in
different ways. This process included investigating which meat cuts were consumed, determining
which elements were available, sawing blanks, experimenting with different blank treatments,
and drilling buttons from the blanks. Results were applied to a case study, an 18th century
almshouse in New York City.

The lithic assemblage from AL 894 (Hadar, Ethiopia) is among the largest discovered from a late

differences in selection patterns between this and broadly contemporaneous Oldowan
assemblages. We use the AL 894 assemblage as a case study that underscores methodological
issues in raw material research on early lithic assemblages. We focus on questions of sampling
and quantification and their effects on understanding decision making processes by early stone
tool makers. Taking these into account, our results also underline the differential effects of
various raw materials on assemblage typo-technological composition.

[109] Assessing the Consumption of Non-Domesticated Plants by the Late Classic Lowland
      Maya
Issues related to sample recover and preservation in Neotropical rainforest contexts often limit
the analysis of plant foods in the diet of the Late Classic (AD 600-900) Maya. Our recent
archaeological investigations of commoner feasting and domestic middens in northwestern
Belize indicate that archaeobotanical remains can be recovered when flotation and dry sieving
techniques are used together. This approach yielded the recovery of a variety of species that are
often considered "wild" or "non-domesticated" in food disposal contexts. The ecological
understanding of these species allows us to reconstruct both the catchment area and their
contribution to food production over and above domesticated plants. This also allows us to
compare everyday consumption with foods consumed periodically in ceremonial contexts.

[47] Aztalan Mortuary Practices Revisited
The late prehistoric Aztalan Site in southeastern Wisconsin has been the focus of speculation
regarding its mortuary practices for many years; even Jane Buikstra has gotten involved. People
have proposed cannibalism, princesses, mound burials, secondary burials, individual interments,
crematories, and other ritual practices. Indeed, one of the most puzzling aspects of the site is
that there has not been a specific mortuary area or cemetery located. Since 1998, I have been
coordinating almost 100 years of research at the site, as well as conducting some new research.
This paper will attempt a new summary and interpretation of Aztalan mortuary practices.

[12] Man, Woman, Place and Medium: Gendering Ceremony, Ceramics and Power in Tiwanaku

Gendering power relations is notoriously difficult for prehistoric complex societies like
Tiwanaku. Tiwanaku‘s primary media (slip-painted serving pottery, stone carving and tapestry
textile) rarely depict identifiable females. Domestic and mortuary contexts may suggest some
gendered activities and statuses, but more work is needed. I present two new sources of
information on gendered space and activities in Tiwanaku: 1) a ceremonial activity area
excavated at the Chen Chen site that suggests gender-specific ritual, and, 2) a hitherto
uninvestigated ―subversive‖ ceramic tradition of female depiction. The potential for associating
distinct ritual spaces and stylistic media with gendered spheres of power and meaning is

features typically associated with defensive architecture, and there is a marked correlation
between the geographical and chronological distribution of burial trauma and enclosed sites,

of the latter or vice versa - nor strictly separated, and in which the relations between humans

Curiosity and speculation have been circulating about chultunob since the initial investigations in
Central America began. In an effort to understand the function and distribution of these
chambers, several projects sponsored by Trent University have excavated chultunob in the
Belize Valley. The results of these projects will be discussed with a focus on how these
investigations have provided new perspectives about chultunob. Unlike the chambers of the
Northern Lowlands which were utilized as water catchment areas, the chultunob of the Southern
Lowland sites appears to have served three functions: burial chambers as well as areas for
storage and ritual activities.

Analysis of ceramics from recent excavation and systematic surface collection at the multi-

local tradition known as Huaracane. We compare and contrast this relationship with the adjacent
dominant Tiwanaku occupation of the same valley. This case study illuminates differences
between these two states‘ integration and consolidation strategies.

[143] Use of Multispectral Thermal Imagery to Map Fossiliferous Sediments of the Koobi Fora
       Formation, Northwestern Kenya
Over 450 hominin specimens ranging in age from 4.3 to 1.2 million years have been found in
the sediments of the Koobi Fora Formation, northwestern Kenya. Imagery from the
Multispectral Thermal Imagery satellite was used to create a digital surface geologic map of
the Koobi Fora Formation. This map has an absolute accuracy of 73 meters in latitude and
longitude. The linear spectral unmixing classification technique was successfully applied to
the map to define tuffaceous sediments. Because hominin fossils are often associated with
this lithology at Koobi Fora, this technique may be of use in defining future sites of
paleoanthropological significance.

[126] Rock Art on the Upper Orinoco, Southwestern Venezuela
Painted rock art along the river valley and its tributaries can be viewed as a series of temporal
styles representing both local development and external influences. Surrounding areas have not
been synthesized, and the extent of the suggested chronological ordering therefore is not known,
but similarities with nearby areas of Brazil, other parts of northern South America, and the
Caribbean suggest the possibility for a widespread general developmental scheme. Intensive
petroglyph production may come in generally late within the sequence, with a different internal
structure and distribution.

Tracing is a common rock art recording method that has been criticized because of potential
impact from direct contact. Although other noncontact techniques are available (e.g., computer
tracing of photographs), direct field tracing is sometimes considered necessary for accuracy. The
Bear Gulch site in central Montana serves as a test case to compare hand-tracing versus
computer tracing relative to expended time and accuracy. Results indicate that for complete
recording, the methods are complementary, with field tracing used with caution.

[109] Pre-Maize Food Production and Anthropogenic Landscapes in Eastern Kentucky
Recent multidisciplinary investigations of river valley deposits in eastern Kentucky reveal an
upland farming system adapted to limited floodplain acreage, dynamic stream systems, and
the demands of population mobility on a topographically rugged landscape. The subsistence
strategy of early food producers combined small-scale plant cultivation with foraging and food
storage. Several lines of evidence point to increased disturbance of vegetation and soils and
changing patterns of land use across the transition to agriculture.

attributes. In conjunction with K-means, this strategy provides a basis for the recognition of
discrete depositional events in Locality 6 at Solvieux and consequently enables the clarification
of horizontal patterning.

Ceremonial bundles are central to Plains Indian religion. Mandan bundles specifically, contained

Chalcatzingo's early expressions of monumentality make it unique in Mexico's central

Archaeologists tend to dismiss the potential that production occurred in the large portion of the

[238] Restructuring of Maya Society at the End of the Classic on the Caribbean Coast
The restructuring of Maya society at the end of the Classic period is reflected in the settlement
patterns of the Caribbean coast. Small ports of trade disappeared to be replaced by fewer,
larger, defensible trade centers as the safety of royal patronage failed. Further, the widespread
occurrence of ―field walls‖ marked a major transition in land tenure among the Maya. These and
other features not only give us an understanding of the events that occurred, but also provide a
window into the Classic system that had been in place previously.

La Blanca Monument 3, discovered in 2004, is formed of modeled earth and shaped as a
quatrefoil. Quatrefoils, which derive from Early Formative depictions of caves and supernatural
portals, do not appear per se until the Middle Formative, and Monument 3 is one of the earliest.
Consistent with other quatrefoil imagery, the La Blanca version appears to be associated with
underworld communication and expressions of elite power. Monument 3 was found on the edge
of an elite residence, near the site center and principal mound. Its context and iconography
suggest a ritual use linked to water, fertility, and underworld portals.

Obsidian is one of the most ubiquitous and easily traceable long-distance exchange goods in the

through which this material was exchanged are among the most difficult to identify. This situation
has been compounded by a research approach in which obsidian from all geological sources is
considered equal. Based on contextual evidence that suggests the Maya ascribed different
values to the various sources of obsidian, this paper will present a new paradigm to explain the
means and rationale behind the Formative and Classic period obsidian trade.

decades, researchers have posited that this shipwreck represents the remains of a vessel that
engaged in illicit trade with contrabandistas and boucaniers of the island's northern coast.
Recent investigations in the Archivos de las Indias in Sevilla, however, suggest an alternative
explanation.

[241] Contradictions as a Source of Historical Perspective: Examples from the Symbolism
      of Sacred Trees and Poles
When using historical ethnographies and the comparative method it can be gratifying to find
close correspondences of ritual elements between the cultures being studied. Contradictions, on
the other hand, can sometimes also be useful, although such contradictions may require broad
interregional comparisons and deep-time perspectives for their resolution. Examples discussed
or referenced include the sacred pole of the Omahas, the bear sacrifice of the Munsee-
Mahicans, the Iroquois Tree of Light, and the ceiba as the World Tree in southern Mesoamerican
cosmology.

[82] Non-Metric Traits and the Assessment of Biological Distance
The use of non-metric and morphometric data as proxies for genetic variation assumes that
variation in morphological data closely reflects similar measures obtained from genetic data. We
examine this question through integration in non-metric trait data in a large geographically
diverse human sample, an analysis of the underlying developmental biology, and a comparison
of mean divergence scores for non-metric trait and mDNA sequence data in a small
archaeologically retrieved sample. We conclude that non-metric trait data do effectively measure
genetic distance and variation. However, their use and the choice of methods must recognize the
differences between genetic and morphological data.

[147] What Does Politics Have to Do with It?: Figurines as Bearers of and Burdens in Late
      Classic Maya Politics
Mesoamerican scholars often portray clay figurines as antithetical to politics and the affairs of the
state. Such conceptions arise, in part, from the domestic recovery contexts of figurines and their
depictions of humans and supernatural beings that are rarely portrayed in monumental media.
This paper argues for a closer link between figurines and state politics by exploring ways in
which Late Classic Maya figurines served as both carriers of and alternatives to political
dispositions and strategies. Particular emphasis is placed on figurine symbolism, technology, and
context from the Maya site of Motul de San José for case examples.

[216] Agency and the Indigenous Response to Conquest
The indigenous response to conquest is difficult to approach archaeologically. Recently, agency
theory has been used to analyze the complexity of the rapid transformation of New and Old world
societies during the early colonial period. This paper applies agency theory to interpretations of
archaeological remains of indigenous houses at Ciudad Vieja, El Salvador (1528-1545). The lack
of indigenous historical documents representing the multiethnic residents of this briefly occupied
colonial center presents both opportunities and challenges to agency-centered interpretations.
Both the lessons learned and the data collected at Ciudad Vieja have implications for contact
and colonial encounters in Mesoamerica and elsewhere.

Detailed petrographic and x-ray diffraction analysis examined numerous ceramic vessels
recovered from the 1959-1963 Paul Barker excavations in northwestern Haiti. Excavations were
undertaken at one cave site with burials on the Ille de la Tortue and five open air coastal or near
flood plain sites near Les Trios Rivieres and Port-de-Paix. The excavations were conducted in
conjunction with a working proposal for an overseas training program that later influenced the
development of Peace Corps efforts in Haiti. Technical ceramic studies selected lots from ca.
200 decorated vessels recovered at the Cadet and Desmarreaux site excavations for analysis.
Petrographic thin section analysis and powder x-ray diffraction studies examined vessel
composition and potentials for geological sourcing of vessel paste and temper. The
precolumbian archaeological investigations by Barker are summarized, including the nature and
character of the artifact assemblages, together with the results of the technical ceramic studies.

[246] Ancient Residential Terracing at Chawak But‟o‟ob, Belize
Dry-slope contour terraces (also known as hill-slope and bench terraces) are a commonly
encountered landscape modification in the Maya lowlands that are traditionally associated with
Prehispanic agriculture, water management, and soil conservation. Archaeological survey and
excavation at the densely-occupied, Late Classic-period (AD 600-850) escarpment site of
Chawak But‘o‘ob in northwestern Belize have documented extensive dry-slope contour terracing
that supports relic domestic platforms and multi-roomed foundation braces. The stacked
residential terraces of this commoner community have parallels in Mesoamerica outside the
Maya area and expand our understanding of the functional variability of Maya terracing.

architectural complexes of numerous major sites and associated experimental replications
suggest that the investment of labor and resource in stone, mortar, and lime for the

close of the Late Preclassic Period. The excesses and exorbitant costs contributed to
societal and environmental stresses and ultimately were some of the primary factors for the
abandonment of the major Preclassic sites of the Basin.

[194] Cooked Corn From Carbonized Crust: Starch Grain Analysis from Food Residue on

Late Woodland Pahaquarra phase ceramics recovered from the Shoemakers Ferry site along
the Delaware River were analyzed for microbotanical remains using starch analysis.
Carbonized residue from the inner surfaces of sherds yielded numerous preserved starch
grains. The starch assemblage was dominated by maize (Zea mays), which correlates with
macrobotanical data from the site. Based on current archaeobotanical evidence, maize arrived
in the region by ca. 1000 AD. The vessels were used to cook other plant foods as well,
including possible species of legume. These results provide a link between cultivated plants
and ceramic artifacts and carry implications of vessel use.

[137] Frames of Reference for Prehistoric Aquatic Resource Intensification
Binford's Intensification Model makes particular predictions about the relative timing and role of
aquatic resources as an element of the process of resource intensification. Specifically, the
model suggests that aquatic resources will be targeted for intensification prior to plant
intensification, if such resources are available. We examine archaeological and stable isotope
data to evaluate these expectations for a portion of North America. For example, an unexpected
level of aquatic use during the Archaic period on the Texas Gulf Coastal Plain appears to be
consistent with the Intensification Model.

Period dart points were used for cutting and sawing activities and not as projectile technology.

were grouped by effective temperature, and these groups were subdivided and searched for
density thresholds relating to structure shape, roofing material, wall material, roof shape, and
floor level. For a given house type in a given environment, these thresholds reduce the range
of likely densities.

trade of heavily taxed commodities, particularly tobacco, which was undertaken by elite merchant
families in seventeenth century Galway, on the west coast of Ireland. The evidence here
represents a tacit resistance to colonial dictates that may reflect how colonial policies shaped
local practices even as those same practices impacted colonial action and reaction. It is only

has come to light and may hint at how similar instances of smuggling can be found, elsewhere.

feminist archaeologists. Our recall of those contributions, however, often is reduced to the
exhortation to "see" women, while forgetting the more complex issues of gender identity and
disciplinary bias. In this paper I will explore how theories of gender, feminism, and identity
change our perspectives of a Late Woodland site in coastal Massachusetts. I would argue that
the progress and pitfalls of early archaeologies of gender are relevant lessons in critically
reviewing contemporary scholarship on social identity.

[14] Estimating Maya Era Population at Yalbac, Belize
Estimating the population of any Maya site is difficult due to uncertainty in establishing household
size and temporal relationships among residential structures. In cases where sites have been
significantly altered post-Contact or have not been thoroughly mapped, demographic estimates
are even more questionable. Computer simulation of agricultural productivity to determine
maximum sustainable population was successfully used to estimate population at Baking Pot, a
thoroughly mapped site. This alternative method, which can be applied to all sites with adequate
soil and meteorological data, is now being applied to Yalbac, Belize, where mapping beyond the
core is unfinished.

[247] Does One Size Fit All? Towards an Archaeology of Dress and Adornment
Dress, adornment, and bodily appearance are notoriously difficult to document archaeologically
and our approaches are theoretically under-developed. While elements of adornment are
frequently recorded and analyzed separately, they are rarely reintegrated into the symbolic
systems of bodily attributes to which they once belonged, and through which they conveyed
messages of social and cultural identity. Using examples of material culture worn as elements of
dress and adornment by aboriginal peoples in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence region, ca. 1400-1800
AD, this paper will discuss and explore opportunities for developing a theory of dress and
adornment in archaeology.

[205] Remembering Emergence and Migration in the Southwest Pueblos
Southwest Pueblos comprise diverse language groups, dual divisions, religious sodalities, and
kin groups with distinct histories. All have stories of emergence, migration, convergence at center
places, and flexible networks of symbols and meaning for clouds, water, caves, serpents, birds,
green stone, maize, colors, directions, and more. Archaeological traces, or "footprints," connect
Pueblo ancestors across language groups and ecological niches, and connect Pueblos with far-
flung ethnic groups in Mexico and beyond. At the same time, different configurations of
iconography and specific histories preserve deliberate differences among the Pueblos, and
heterodoxy within Pueblo villages.

[126] The Ultimate Rorschach Test: A History of Rock Art Interpretation in the Greater Antilles
Early interpretation of rock art in the Greater Antilles was hampered by diffusionist theories from
Mesoamerica and the uncritical adoption of ethnographic analogy from inappropriate culture-
geographic areas such as North America and Europe. By the late 1970s and 1980s the
rediscovery of the 15th century study of Pane, when coupled with a study of lowland South
Amerindian mythology and cosmology, revolutionized the field. The 1990s and 2000s has seen
the introduction of modern recording techniques, a first relative chronology via seriation and
attention to the context, mutual thematic and structural relationships between petroglyphs and
pictographs. Current interest centers on archaeoastronomy, the cultural use of symmetry, and
the recapitulation of cosmology.

[132] Isotope Analysis and Radiocarbon Dating of Prehistoric Human Bone from Manzanilla 1,
       Cocos Bay, Trinidad
Manzanilla 1 (San 1) is a shell-midden site located on the east coast of Trinidad. Between 2001-
1004, mapping and excavations by archaeologists from Leiden University revealed that 250,000
m2 site, atop a 4.5 m tall plateau, was largely in tact. Excavations unearthed artifacts (ceramics,
lithics, and worked shell), ecofacts, evidence of ancient structures, and features (including
burials). This paper reports on carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of human bone samples
derived from two burials, and compares the results to studies from elsewhere in the Caribbean.
Observations are made about the diet and subsistence in ancient Trinidad. Radiocarbon
determinations on the same bone samples suggest that at least part of the habitation at
Manzanilla 1 occurred from AD 1200-1400.

[90] Human Agency and Anthropogenic Landscapes: Southern Amazonia
This paper discusses how human agency is reflected in the constructed "anthropogenic"
landscapes of Amazonia. Three primary historical periods are discussed: early Formative period
(c. 2500-1500 BP); the rise of regional social formations, complex societies (c. 1500-500 BP),
and the post-European period (after c. 1492). The Upper Xingu region (southern Amazon),
specifically, is used to consider the scale, organization, and built environment of pre-Columbian
social formations, based on "participatory" and interdisciplinary research approaches.
Correlations with other areas are discussed, in light of regional indigenous history, cultural rights,
and contemporary issues of conservation and development.

[75] Conformity in Mimbres Pottery, Constraints on Mimbres Lives?
We have argued that homogeneity in Classic Mimbres material culture is indicative of social
conformity associated with social and subsistence stresses. Here, we evaluate this argument in
more detail, focusing on the designs on Mimbres painted bowls. Analyses consider symmetry,
structure, type of motif, and types of design elements. We include collections from the Mimbres
Valley and the eastern Mimbres area. Thus we are able to consider whether the Mimbres Valley
(which had more evidence of subsistence and social stress) had less diversity, indicative of
greater conformity. We can also evaluate if diversity decreased over time as stress increased.

[30] New Evidence for the Use of Fire in Ancient Quarrying
The use of fire can be extremely efficient in the quarrying of hard, siliceous rocks, particularly for
creating surface-parallel cracks along which blocks can be extracted – a technique applied since
the Palaeolithic. New evidence shows that fire setting was much more widely used in Ancient
Egypt than previously believed, where highly specialized skills were developed in applying fire
setting to different rocks and production purposes. The acknowledgement of fire setting as
important in ancient hard rock quarrying raises many questions concerning ancient extraction
technology and the influence of quarrying operations on the local environment.

enacted through them in the Late to Terminal Classic Maya polity of Copan (Honduras)
demonstrates that the domestic is not a domain solely concerned with basic processes of
reproduction and socialization. On the contrary, it is through daily practice that social, economic,
and political relations are materialized and questions of status, control, and authority contested.

[60] Circular Kancha Enclosures: Theatres of Social Interaction
In this paper I address the active and changing role of circular kancha and patio group
enclosures in the Ancash highlands of Peru. The structure of these circular and tower-like
buildings, I argue, was pivotal to the generation and negotiation of social identity (and difference)
for most of the first millennium AD. Individual and collective movement in such orchestrated
architectural settings bound groups of individuals, possibly mortuary and ceremonial
communities, to ―their‖ ancestral dead. The ubiquity of such theatres of social interaction in
central Conchucos suggests, that many durable social groups shared a similarly structured, and
closely interrelated, sacred landscape.

between modern and premodern situations -the paper explores how archaeological studies of
the most recent past question the distance between past and present, archaeologist and object.
Rather than leading to a new interpretive formalism, based around the geometrical metaphor of
symmetry, the paper proposes a shift away from 'asymmetric' approaches towards accounts that
foreground complexity, material agency, noncoherence and partiality.

The transition to formative lifeways in the New World is often viewed as driven by

maintenance responsibilities and rewards were not evenly distributed among and within

phenotype. The beliefs and practices concerning the treatment of individuals with Down
syndrome among various small-scale societies are discussed.

taking in other regions of the world, is inadequate within a Peruvian context. Examination of
context coupled with cross-cultural data suggests that alternative interpretations may better

of regional inequalities in the abundance of water, wood, and lithic resources. Paleoindians likely
practiced a strategy that combined seasonal mobile big game hunting in grassland settings with
semi-permanent camping in protected habitats.

[66] The Smell of the Shrub Tundra: Rethinking the Archaeology of Beringia
Beringia was occupied during the Lateglacial (15-12.8 ka) with the transition to a mesic shrub
tundra. The spreading availability of fuel in the form of woody shrubs may have been critical to
settlement. The economy reflected a broad-based northern interior diet typical of the postglacial
era. The Lateglacial Beringians created a unique industry (Beringian tradition) that bore few
similarities to industries outside Beringia. Major change occurred during the Younger Dryas
interval (12.8-11.3 ka), with the intrusion of bison hunters from the Plains (Paleoindian tradition),
and simultaneous proliferation of microblade assemblages (Paleoarctic tradition).

[41] Shifting Boundaries: Archaeology on the Eskimo/Aleut Frontier
The identity and interaction of people living at the boundaries between cultures has fascinated
archaeologists the world over. One such boundary exists on the Alaska Peninsula between
speakers of Eskimo (Alutiiq/Yupik) and Aleut (Unangan). We report here the results of
excavations at two sites just north of the historic Eskimo/Aleut frontier. We find differences
between their components dating to around 1500 BP. The southern site has an affinity with
Aleutian Tradition sites to the south and our northern site resembles Norton Tradition sites to the
north. After 1000 BP, both sites resemble Thule/Koniag Tradition sites, demonstrating a southern
expansion of this culture.

[244] Archaeological Investigations at the Long Bay Site, San Salvador, Bahamas
The first place in the New World where Christopher Columbus went ashore on 12 October 1492
was the island of San Salvador in the Bahamian archipelago in the northern part of the
Caribbean. There has been much debate over the years as to which island is the real San
Salvador. We have come to assume, especially after the works of Samuel Morison and Ruth
Wolper, that it is the island presently bearing that name. But Joseph Judge has built a strong
case for it being another island farther south. Historic records reveal that Columbus saw people
on the island, and that he exchanged many trinkets with them - glass beads, fragments of
crockery, coins, and other things. Archaeological research presented in this paper covers four
seasons of excavations at a site of aboriginal occupation situated close to the presumed San
Salvador landing place, and the finding of prehistoric pottery in direct association with objects
similar to those Columbus reported trading to the Indians. This evidence supports a strong case
for the present-day San Salvador being the site of that momentous first landing.

[1] Ties with the "Motherland:" Archipelagic Interaction and the Enduring Role of the South
    American Mainland in the Pre-Columbian Caribbean
This paper discusses the interaction networks that existed between pre-Columbian island
communities and their perpetual ties with the :motherland," the South American mainland.
Various lines of evidence are examined: mobility of people through isotope and DNA analysis,
exchange of materials through the study of ceramic style, microlapidary objects and lithic raw
materials and the transfer of ideas through the study of symbols and cultural traditions. This
study adopts a multi-disciplinary perspective incorporating archaeological, archaeometric,
ethnohistorical and ethnographic data. This multi-dimensional approach is essential in
disentangling the complex web of social relationships that once linked the archipelagic
communities to their motherland.

[100] A New Point on the Frison Effect
Are projectile points the end product in a reduction sequence? Do they ever change shape after
manufacture? In this research I address these questions and conclude that projectile point
variation can not be explained without addressing behaviors such as maintenance, recycling,
and reuse. To illustrate this perspective I classify Cienega points from Southern Arizona into a
reduction trajectory typology. I then show that this typology facilitates the investigation of a broad
range of behavioral issues such as hunting intensity, the technological selection process,
resource management, and recycling decisions.

Although hunting and tool-stone procurement are often emphasized, early hunter-gatherers of

A significant advantage of non-contact laser scanning is that it allows multiple analysts in

[100] Paleofluting - Mechanics or Culture?
This illustrated paper discusses possible origins for Paleoindian fluting technology. It is based on
study collections from northern Florida and adjacent southern Georgia. The basic premise is that
fluting originated in earlier-than Clovis lanceolate forms in this geographical area. Based on
semi-fluted specimens, it was a developmental technology that evolved into the full-face fluting,
such as the Cumberland and Folsom types. Since Florida has few paleosite excavations and
subsequent radiocarbon dates, comparative morphology is used to argue fluting stages.
Numerous Southeastern lanceolates show basal thinning flakes that is argued as being the
―learning or initiating‖ stages for fluting.

Pastoralists regularly practice patterns of subsistence with little direct connection to the products

that the contribution of pastoral products to diet is directly related to the dependability of plant
resources. Second, low primary productivity and extreme seasonality often lead to herds
composed of mostly small bodied sized stock. The result of varying herd demographics is
differential rates of milk or meat in the pastoral diet.

[195] Geophytes, Beyond a Caloric Approach
Geophytes are plant resources commonly exploited by women. Plant exploitation is normally
modeled of in terms of caloric gain. Ethnographic reported use of some geophytes suggests that
they may have been acquired for reasons supplemental to caloric gain. Recently, anthropologists
have examined the effects of non-caloric benefits on hunting decisions and faunal patterning.
Could these non-caloric benefits influence vegetal resource decisions as well? The distribution
and chemical structure of some geophytes makes them an excellent candidate for social payoffs.

investigate this possibility.

[177] Changes in Spatial Relations Produce Changes in Social Relations: A Dwelling
      Perspective at Chunchucmil
Excavations within houselots at Chunchucmil coupled with paleobotanical and soil chemical
analyses enable detailed reconstructions of the use of space. As the social groups occupying
these houselots grew, new structures were built and spatial relations were transformed. A
dwelling perspective assumes that a subject's identity is formed through relations to other
people, places and things, and that these relations come into being through daily activities. As
the spatial context of activities changes, so does the nature of the relations formed through
performing that activity. This paper describes the transformations in social relations that resulted
from transformations to the built environment.

[226] The Impact of Microenvironments on Socioeconomic Organization in the Maya Lowlands: A
      Stone Tool Perspective
The Maya Lowlands are a diverse physiographic landscape comprised of multiple
microenvironments. In the Late Classic, it is believed that land-use specific communities evolved
in less optimal localities creating dependency relationships between sites. In this paper I present
the results of the lithic analysis from three sites in Northwestern Belize, concluding that the lithic
technological organization reflects localized resource specialization, supporting the theory that
these communities functioned in variable ways relative to their specialized position in their
microenvironment. This study's regional approach to understanding lithic artifact assemblages
refines our perception of Late Classic Lowland Maya socio-economic organization.

In the year 1997, the USDA Forest Service, Southern Region, began providing technical
application and assistance in the fields of Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Database Systems,
and Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR, a geophysical sensing technology). In 2001, through a
grant from NCPTT, we hosted the first ever GPR Workshop and have modified it to include GPS
and mobile computing training on an annual basis. We also began sharing similar assistance
through the USDA Forest Service Heritage Excursion Sangro Valley Project (SVP). The site of
the SVP is that of Monte Pallano in the Abruzzo Region of Italy. The sharing of technologies is
inherent to the Forest Service partnerships with Oberlin College of Ohio, Oxford University, and
the Archaeological Superintendency of the Abruzzo. We have worked alongside SVP
participants collecting GPR data and using a Mobile computing kit to collect GPS data. This year,
we incorporated using a rather simple tool, the metal detector. This presentation will discuss the
intricacies of these partnerships, working with data, an exhibition of data results and how you can

Multidisciplinary investigations at the Los Ajos mound complex in the wetlands of southeastern
Uruguay revealed that during an increasingly drier mid-Holocene, at around 4,190 yr BP, Los
Ajos became a permanent circular plaza village and its people subsisted on mixed economies
adopting major crop plants such as maize (Zea mays L.) and squash (Cucurbita spp.) long
before previously thought. This paper will discuss the implications of these findings for the

Huari was the capital of a vast pre-Inca polity although this great city in Peru's central highland
Ayacucho Valley remains little excavated. Of the areas studied, one represents middle class

new excavations at Nawinpukyu, the capital of a local pre-Huari polity, Conchopata, Huari's
second city in the Ayacucho Valley, and several provincial centers from colonized territories.

Although inland eolian dunes on the U.S. Atlantic Coastal Plain were emplaced during the late
Pleistocene, localized Holocene remobilization (due to human activity or climate) resulted in
buried soil A horizons on the lee sides of some dunes. Along the Altamaha River in southern
Georgia radiocarbon ages suggest multiple phases of remobilization. Dates from charred wood
fragments include 10520 ± 40, 4170 ± 60, and 3180 ± 40 14C yr BP. The youngest of these
phases may relate to Late Archaic or Early Woodland Period human occupation of the site. A

Conventional interpretations regarding the consolidation of the Tiwanaku state locate the forces

at all, the processes considered to have played starring roles in the rise of urbanism in the south-

research in early Tiwanaku settlements to demonstrate that recurring social practices with
interwoven economic, political, and ideological dimensions were pivotal in stimulating the rise of
full-fledged cities and their constituent manifestations of power. In focus here are domestic
offerings, mortuary practices, and rituals of consumption, as well as local participation in the
construction and ritualized celebration of Tiwanaku's monumental edifices.

[58] Fun with Dick and Jane: Co-opting the Hunt in Prehistory and Academia
Comparative ethnoarchaeological research on hunter-gatherers in the Circumpolar world has
revealed an inverse correlation between the size of major animal resources and the time devoted
to the direct harvest phase of hunting by women. That is, women participate directly in the
dispatch and processing of smaller animals, but as prey size increases, women devote more
time and energy to the indispensable butchering, processing, storage and food distribution
phases of hunting. However, the archaeological literature on the hunting of large animals is
virtually silent on women and women‘s roles in hunting. This raises intriguing questions regarding
academic anthropology and archaeology, and its relationship to gender bias and blindness, and
how such dynamics impact our profession‘s interpretation of women and men‘s lives in
prehistory.

The recently discovered and excavated site of Chez-Pinaud Jonzac (Charente- Maritime,
France) contains a particularly rich and apparently well preserved "bone bed" deposit associated
with a Quina Mousterian stone tool industry. Analysis of material from the previous excavations
show a faunal assemblage dominated by reindeer but with perhaps a shift towards other species
towards the end. The stone tool industries appear to be characterized almost exclusively by large
Quina type scrapers and debitage associated not with the production of the flake blanks
themselves but instead by the production and maintenance of usable edges on these blanks.
New excavations are underway to collect better data on the processes that created these bone
bed deposits that share striking similarities with the nearby eponymous site of La Quina.

survival in starvation years. Elk hunting increased in importance since the 1890s; it was and is
practiced in ceded lands. Through documentation of contemporary elk hunting in the Badger-
Two Medicine watershed, one can gain insights not only into site formation processes but also
into traditional landscape uses that may be endangered by recreational developments.

The impact of Spanish colonialism on the Plains-Pueblo exchange is not well understood. Pre-

Pueblo and Plains Indians. In the early colonial period (AD 1598-1680), European traders
became involved in the Plains-Pueblo exchange, which expanded to include manufactured
goods and captives. By the late colonial period (AD 1680-1821), Europeans, mestizos, and
Plains Indians actively traded livestock, slaves, and manufactured goods across the New
Mexico-Plains boundary. The colonial adoption and infiltration of existing exchange networks
transformed indigenous economic systems in the Southwest and in other colonized areas.

model this process, ethnographic and archaeological cases will be examined. The focus will
be on the spatial and temporal patterns of the process, the criteria used for selecting new
settlement locations, and the means by which these criteria are managed in decision-making.

[204] INAA of Samoan Basalt Quarries on the Island of Tutuila
Basalt tools have long been the focus of Polynesian geochemical sourcing analysis. In that time,
attempts to trace artifacts to individual Tutuilan quarries have achieved varying degrees of
success. Prior to establishing a single quarry of origin, variation of quarry sources must be
properly defined. In a preliminary attempt to determine intraisland quarry signatures, samples
from Tutuilan prehistoric basalt quarries were analyzed at the Texas A&M Center for Chemical
Characterization using Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA). In addition to material-
centered sampling, basalt artifacts recovered from sites across Tutuila were also analyzed to
determine their possible quarry source.

[131] Settlement Dynamics in the Cochuah Region of the Yucatan Peninsula
The settlements between and surrounding the ancient Maya capital cities of Ichmul and Yo'okop
experienced periods of occupation and abandonment. Viewed collectively, there is a clear
pattern of population pulses across the landscape. This pattern is compared to the data from the
larger centers to determine if these changes represent cycles of nucleation and dispersal, or
variation in the overall population levels. Various hypotheses that might explain these changes
through time are examined.

[228] Perishable Artifacts from Cascada Seca, Eastern New Mexico
In 2001, two burials were recovered by Southwest Archaeological Consultants, Inc. eroding from
an embankment in Union County, New Mexico. The associated perishable artifact inventory,
including fragments of coiled basketry, sewn twined matting, cordage, and knotted netting,
provides a unique glimpse into prehistoric perishable technology at the western edge of the
Southern Plains. On the basis of radiocarbon determinations and funerary offerings, the burials
are suggested to have a Sopris phase (AD 1000-1250) affiliation. This presentation describes the
technology of the perishable artifacts and considers them in light of a comparison with existing
perishable artifact data from the Southern Plains.

[41] Economy and the Rural Landscape of Central Cyprus: The Ceramic Evidence from the
     Malloura Valley
Since 1990, the Athienou Archaeological Project has investigated the Malloura Valley at the
edge of the fertile Mesaoria Plain. The ceramics retrieved from excavation of the Roman-Late
Medieval settlement and a group of Archaic-Roman tombs in the center of the valley, and found
during survey at small sites scattered throughout the project area include foreign imports,
Cypriot imitations of such styles, and distinctive local wares. The pottery suggests this rural
hinterland had a vibrant economy through time because of its strategic location between major
polities, i.e., its peripheral position in the political system provided economic benefits.

[107] Changing Subsistence and Landscape Use at Picuris Pueblo, 1440-1850
European contact brought many changes to the New Mexican landscape, including the
introduction of domesticated plants and animals with origins in the Old World. This poster
investigates landscape use and subsistence at Picuris Pueblo over four centuries of social and
environmental change, using data from Herbert W. Dick‘s excavations in the 1960s and 70s
(Adler and Dick 1999). Particular attention is paid to the adoption of Old World domesticates and
resulting changes in both landscape and subsistence. Environmental factors, cultural identity,
and niche diversification are all considered as potential contributing factors to long-term change
at Picuris.

[3] Using GIS to Explore the Relationship between Site Area and Population Size among
    Northern Iroquoian Groups
Using settlement remains to estimate population size has been the most effective method for
estimating North American precontact population numbers. The Northern Iroquoian ―snapshot‖
settlement strategy provides almost ideal conditions for studying past demographic trends. This
research expands on Snow‘s (1995) and Warrick‘s (1990) work by testing their proposed
relationships between site area and population size. If this relationship can be further supported
using GIS technology along with modern demographic theory, it will establish a link between
settlement size and population size for Northern Iroquoians that will allow researchers to
estimate precontact populations with little more than site area.

A period of regional urban abandonment followed the first urban fluorescence in the southern
Levant. Excavation of the Early Bronze IV period (2300-2000 BC) village of Dhahrat Umm al-
Marar in the northern Jordan Valley, Jordan, revealed a 1 ha agricultural village with domestic
structures and an encircling wall. Although floral and faunal preservation was poor, abundant
boulder and slab mortars attest to the processing of cereal grains. Comparing the percentage of
serving, storage and food preparation vessels reported from other sites showed that residents at
Umm al-Marar used fewer food preparation pots and more storage vessels.

The analysis of pollen from sediment cores collected along the coast of Chiapas has greatly
augmented the record established through prior phytolith studies. In particular, evidence for
human settlement, forest clearing and field maintenance, and site abandonment are usually
illuminated in the pollen record. Ample radiocarbon dates of significant events recorded in
these cores provide a temporal framework for human activity in this region. These data,
when examined with comparable pollen studies from coastal Guerrero and Guatemala are
beginning to paint a detailed picture of settlement patterns, agricultural practices and human
impact in southwest Mexico and Guatemala.

[89] Ethnographic Perspectives on Fishing and Community Social Dynamics in the Pacific
     Islands
This paper begins by summarizing key points from current literature regarding social complexity
and subsistence in the Pacific Islands. Anthropological theories generally assume that reliable
food resources, especially abundant and diverse marine fauna, support increased social
complexity. Conversely, I argue that a decrease in the reliability of fish resources may produce
increasingly complex social interactions. Importantly, the way anthropologists measure "social
complexity" is primarily based on the presence and intensity of public social institutions, such as
political chiefdoms. However, the anthropological idea of "complexity" does not necessarily apply
to every day interactions within communities, including family level and interpersonal relations.
Community interactions including tribute, the division of labor, the division of food resources, and
food sharing are extremely complicated, and become increasingly so when food shortages exist
or when sustainability decreases. Specifically I discuss my own data and ethnographic/
ethnohistoric case studies related to fishing in Fiji and Polynesia. Finally, I discuss the relevance
of this ethnographic data to archaeology.

[22] Ground Penetrating Radar -- Does One Size Fit All?
The recent explosion of ground penetrating (GPR) use by archeologists has been made possible
by new push-button digital GPR technologies, significant advances in 2D and 3D GPR imaging
software, and the relatively inexpensive costs of both. But just how "good" for archaeology is the
imagery produced and, more importantly, of the interpretations made from the imagery? What
happens if it doesn't work and you don't know the difference? For archeologists, historians,
contractors, and contracting officers, this paper explores the rise in use of GPR in archeological
applications, the opportunities and pitfalls of GPR in the archeological profession, and what you
need to know to make it work. Some examples of the good, the bad, and the ugly will illustrate
the talk.

The objective of the research was to examine the socio-cultural correlates of salt use in rites of

historical documentation of transitional rites involving salt use. Nearly thirty percent of all of the
cultures in the eHRAF ethnographic database utilized salt in rites of transition. The results
indicate a strong link between low-sodium subsistence agriculture and salt use in rites of

[89] Other Fish to Fry: Reconstructing Late Prehistoric Fisheries and Their Social Context

Under the shadow of the sophisticated fishing culture that characterizes the Santa Barbara
Channel, the central California coast is often overlooked as a region that can contribute to
understanding maritime adaptations. New information from the San Simeon Reef during the
Late Prehistoric, however, indicates an increased dependency on fish over time and provides
insights into social responses. This research reconstructs fishing technology and social
organization prior to Spanish contact. By at least 1000 AD occupants increasingly turned to
fishing to maximize littoral foraging productivity, while buffering against risks associated with
environmental fluctuations and changes in logistic priorities.

[54] The Afterlife of Monte Albán: Postclassic Ritual Practices on the Main Plaza
Despite the collapse of Monte Albán as a political center, Early Postclassic people marked the
site as a sacred place by leaving ritual offerings in Classic-Period tombs and in Temple-Patio-
Altar complexes. The consistency of the content and context of offerings suggest that they were
based on social memories of the earlier significance of these places. During the Late
Postclassic the interment of nobles in reused tombs, the deposition of ritual offerings, and the
construction of a fortress brought together people from multiple communities, mediating
interpolity conflict and reproducing a broader social identity that reflected common historical ties
to Monte Albán.

[111] When the Flesh is Solid but the Person is Hollow Inside: Formal Variation in Hand-
       modeled Figurines from Formative Mesoamerica
Hand-modeled ceramic figurines are the earliest preserved medium of representation of the
human body in Mesoamerica. They predate our earliest evidence of shaping the corporeal body
in life and death. I argue that the shaping of corporeal bodies and of figural bodies were linked
recursively, and together were practices of embodiment. From this perspective, the formal
characteristics of figurines--the choice to make a thin skin enclosing a hollow interior, or to shape
layers of specific detail around an undifferentiated solid core-- are not simply iconic, but indexical
of the experiences and understandings of the living bodies of figurine makers.

[10] Dying to Serve: Human Sacrifice during the Classic Kerma Period
The royal cemetery of Kerma (1750-1550 BC), Upper Nubia, featured tumuli bisected by mass
inhumation corridors and a central royal burial chamber. Though the corridor burials have been
attributed to human sacrifice, no bioarchaeological investigation has occurred to date that
confirms this assumption. Our study revealed a comparable trauma profile for both "corridor" and
"non-corridor" samples, with no perimortem trauma among the former. Likewise, statistical
analyses of 13 cranial measurements established the phenetic similarity of the samples. The
"corridor" people who were selected or volunteered to accompany their king to his afterlife
reflected the composition of Kerma society.

The Archaic fishermen-gatherers campsite at QLB was occupied between 10,000 and 6,000
BP, in the course of a calm and wet climatic phase. The inhabitants relied intensively on ocean
resources complemented by terrestrial hunting. Broad horizontal excavations revealed seven
occupation levels that contained accumulations of food waste, living floor features and
specialized activity areas. Abundant lithic material and bone instruments indicate sophisticated
fishing and foraging techniques. To resolve the problem of seasonal or year round occupations
and the possible origins of the human groups, various researches have been initiated: isotopic
and sclerochronological analyses, determination of lithic raw material sources.

The Spanish policy of congregacion, or forced population nucleation, had widespread cultural

implementation of this policy or the indigenous reaction it elicited. This paper analyzes the
frontier congregacion center of Ichmul in its regional context indicating that settlement decisions
made by the affected population mimic patterns seen elsewhere in the Yucatan. Further
archaeological evidence suggests that this pattern was maintained regardless of the minimal
Spanish presence. This analysis of Ichmul, therefore, improves our understanding of colonial
interaction on the frontier of Spanish control.

Open-air localities at Geelbek and Anyskop offer new insight into the behavior of MSA hunter-
gatherers. The deflation bays within these mobile dunes display large-scale spatial patterning of
lithic artifacts and faunal remains. By analyzing lithic raw material units we reconstructed
patterns of selection, production, use and discard of artifacts. The results reveal that MSA
hunter-gatherers employed diverse planning strategies of raw material exploitation, transport,
technology and site use. Stone points and segments suggest that hunting played an important
role in the activities documented. The low number and heterogeneity of stone artifacts suggest
that people of the MSA were highly mobile.

on contact materials such as shell, clay, bone, plant material, different types of wood and seeds
was carried out with the replicated coral tools in order to set up a reference collection to which
the artifacts could be compared. The comparison of the use wear traces on the artifacts with the
experimental use wear traces brought forth positive results which gave insights about the types
of materials on which the coral tools were used by the inhabitants of the Anse à La Gourde site
in Guadeloupe.

[242] The Use of Maize in Peninsular Florida: Stable Isotope Analysis
It has been hypothesized that the Native Americans of peninsular Florida adopted, and
developed characteristics of complex societies without adopting agriculture. However, and
contrary to most archaeological evidence, the results from this research suggest that maize was
a part of the diets for groups from inland Florida, and prehistoric Gulf Coast populations as early
as AD 500-700. Stable isotope analysis was performed on more than 100 individuals from
Florida, dating from the Archaic (2000 BC) through the Late Caloosahatchee period (after AD
850). Nine archaeological sites were analyzed in this study, and represent changes in
subsistence practice over time.

[205] The Importance of Being Specific: Theme and Trajectory in Mississippian Iconography
Southeastern iconography of the Mississippian Period has had a difficult time shedding the
lingering perception that the so-called similarities with Mesoamerican depictions are indicative of
an ultimate derivation from that continental center. Superficial similarities between images of
each region notwithstanding, an examination of the stylistic histories of relevant Mesoamerican
and Mississippian regions reveals a strong level of independent development in each. Left for
further analysis, however, are specific parallels in thematic content, which for the most part have
escaped attention. A satisfactory account of these will require an adequate handle on the social,
economic and cultural contexts of this content.

[52] Cabotage or Contraband: Compositional Analysis of French Colonial Ceramics
There is a considerable literature that explores the significance of low fired earthenware
production as a component of African Diaspora identity creation and maintenance both in the
West Indies and in the American Southeast. Very little analysis has gone into understanding the
role of industrially produced ceramics in the Caribbean. In this paper we discuss compositional
analysis of archaeological ceramics and wasters recovered from historic kiln sites on the islands
of Dominica, Martinique, and the Guadeloupe Archipelago, and to compare them with ceramic
sherds from excavated domestic contexts elsewhere on these islands to reconstruct trade and
exchange patterns during the French colonial period. The results from these analyses not only
point to expected routes of trade but also routes which contravened colonial boundaries.

The study of DNA extracted from ancient remains is an exciting new avenue of research that can
provide novel evidence for addressing questions about prehistory. Here we explore how ancient
DNA (aDNA) differs from modern DNA, sources from which aDNA can be extracted, and review
previous applications of aDNA (with a focus on the Americas). As the study of aDNA is
methodologically challenging, analyses are costly. We offer practical, cost/benefit advice to
archaeologists who are considering DNA analysis. Topics covered range from sample
preparation that minimizes contamination to expectations that archaeologists can have of an
aDNA researcher.

By analyzing and comparing the material culture from Hofstadir and Sveigakot, two Viking Age

[9] Archaic Period Shellfish Harvesting Strategies on the Pacific Coast of Southern Mexico
Oxygen isotopic analyses of marsh clams from the littoral site of Tlacuachero indicate a shift in
exploitation from the dry to wet season through the Late Archaic Period (~5,500-4,000 BP). This
shift is coincident with the appearance of maize phytoliths at 5,000 BP. We have interpreted this
change as reflecting scheduling conflicts between maize cultivation, particularly clearing forest,
and wild resource use in the littoral zone during the dry season. This hypothesis is tested with
oxygen isotopic analysis of marsh clams from El Chorro, a Late Archaic Period shellmound with
deposits dating to between 4,400 and 4,200 BP.

In the mid-first millennium BC, the Achaemenid Empire, centered in Iran, governed a vast
territory, from Central Asia to the Mediterranean. Little is known about the political and social
organization of this diverse polity, which is often reductively characterized as a dichotomous
system of omnipotent kings and subject vassals. Established conceptions of the Achaemenid
Empire are a consequence of agendas set by elite voices, whether Greek authors or the

[242] Inferring Complexity from Very Rapid Construction of Mound A at Poverty Point, NE

Archaeologists recognize pre-modern hunter-fisher-gatherer behavior is not simple. Still,
dimensions of complexity among people practicing these subsistence modes are poorly
understood or exaggerated. Excavations in Mound A at Poverty Point indicate this large earthen
mound was built very rapidly, perhaps in less than a year. This indicates pre-agricultural people
were congregating in large populations and allows us to infer social, economic, and political
organization was well developed and possibly centralized. The scale and speed of mound
building belies the notion that this mound was erected over a long period of time by people with
little or no formal social organization.

distant and unchangeable past, one proved by ruined and abandoned buildings and cemeteries
in the landscape now reconfigured as "relics." White planter families used this nostalgia-based
aesthetic and its ruins and relics in part to establish complete social control, while their enslaved
laborers used it to subvert their use of total power. Outsiders used it to condemn the
"backwardness" of the region; in the 21st century, we use it to celebrate the "world before"

       Leadership Strategies in the Lake Titicaca Basin, Peru
In the Lake Titicaca Basin, the sunken court complex has long been considered the archetypal

hosts or intended audiences for these events. A diachronic study of public spaces at the regional
center of Pukara, specifically the courts and monumental spaces of the central ceremonial

[147] Sex in the City: A Comparison of Aztec Ceramic Figurines to Sculptures Found at or

This paper will compare certain categories of small scale Aztec ceramic figurines, most of which
appear to have been used in a household context, with large scale, apparently state-
commissioned Aztec statues and figurines in other media (including copal) in an effort to refine
our understanding of their formal, iconographic, and functional relationship. It will argue that in
the case of certain types of Aztec figurines, particularly those representing animals and women,
the differences between the two genres are not as great as previously thought. This suggests
that the Aztec State appropriated and simply modified certain kinds of domestic art forms
produced by commoners rather than promoting an essentially new, official, and patriarchal visual
vocabulary entirely unrelated to commoner beliefs. Specifically, the government seems to have
adapted certain domestic art forms probably used to promote the health and fertility of individuals
and kin groups to prove that its own, imperial actions served its constituents‘ best interests. If
valid, this finding calls for a reevaluation of not only the traditional centrifugal model of Aztec
imperial influence, but also the feminist claim that female Aztec ceramic figurines represented a
form of ideological ―resistance‖ to male patriarchy and official ideology.

[85] Tales of the Mountains and Steppes: Reconstructing Social Complexity in the Absence of

This paper reviews criticisms of comparative neo-evolutionary approaches to the study of
complex societies and raises the question of their general credibility despite their limitations. It
presents evidence for the origins of complexity during the late Early Bronze Age in the Caucasus
and during the Late Bronze Age on the Eurasian steppes, particularly in the construction of
monumental structures and the extraction of ores and diffusion of metalworking technologies.
While such evidence may not have direct analogies in the ethnographic record, the societies that
produced these remains must be reconstructed upon the rational calculations of the peoples who
made them.

[7] A Scale Model of 700 Years of Farming Settlements in Southwest Colorado
We review the demographic and settlement history of the 700-year occupation of the 1800-sq-km
portion of the central Mesa Verde region studied by the Village Ecodynamics project, paying
special attention to the implications that social strife and carrying capacity may have had for this
demographic trajectory. We use allometric scaling to identify anomalies in scaling relationships
among sites to explore the formation of aggregated villages. Changing scaling relationships
through time require explanations drawn from history and from sociopolitical and ecological
processes.

[149] An Ethnoarchaeology of Urban Processes: The Case of La Paz, Bolivia
This paper presents some preliminary conclusions based on recent ethnoarchaeological
research carried out in La Paz, Bolivia. The research is part of a long-term archaeological project
concerned with the urban built environment under colonial and post-colonial social conditions. An
ethnoarchaeological investigation into the intersection of political authority, history and
urbanization was carried out via a case study of the historical social production of one vernacular
neighborhood, including its relation to the city and its institutions as a whole. Some initial results
of this research will be discussed.

[248] Frank Hamilton Cushing's Explorations of the South Florida Gulf Coast, 1895-96
The writings of Frank Hamilton Cushing, a noted anthropologist of the late 19th century, convey
his intuitive genius and comprehension of the complex world of prehistoric southwest Florida. In
his exploration along the Gulf Coast, he detailed observations of the terrain and archaeological
sites in a still natural Florida that give a rare insight into the interrelationships of ancient marine
cultures and their environments. Cushing's important descriptions and drawings of Charlotte
Harbor sites and his remarkable findings at Key Marco from his recently published journals and
manuscript offer new information into his significant contribution to Florida archaeology.

[238] The Important, Yet Elusive, Role of Maya Sacbeob
The role of sacbeob, causeways of the Preclassic and Classic Maya, remains one of the least
understood features of site layout. Why were formal roads built in a society without beasts of
burden or wheeled vehicles? Mayanists often assume that sacbeob served to connect ritual and
elite complexes within centers and to connect site centers with outlying settlements or more
distant centers. However, not all centers have them. The apparent random distribution of
causeways demonstrates the need for further study into the importance of sacbeob and site
planning. This paper explores their distribution and proposes explanations for their varied
presence.

[163] Results and Interpretations of the Technological Research at Tiwanaku, Bolivia
Remote sensing research in the form of satellite /aerial photography and geophysics has
become an important part of archaeological investigations at the site of Tiwanaku. One
geophysical method, ground-penetrating radar, has been used successfully for three field
seasons with more than 100,000 m2 of data collected. During the 2005 season four additional
geophysical techniques were employed to further map the subsurface. These include
conductivity, resistivity, magnetometry and susceptibility. Additionally, the integration of satellite
images and aerial photographs with theses geophysical methods gives further understanding to
Tiwanaku‘s built environment. This paper will outline the remote sensing techniques used, data
collected and incorporated results.

The architectural and ceramic records at the Lowland Maya site of Blue Creek in northwestern

Transformations in the nature of monumental constructions in the site core and associated ritual
activities, along with shifts in ceramic sphere connections provide a framework for understanding
the sociopolitical development of the site. Furthermore, alterations in the manipulation of the built
environment in conjunction with changes in the ceramic assemblages can be interpreted as

[40] Reconstructing the Environment of the Laetoli Hominids: Evidence from Bovid Remains
Laetoli, Tanzania, preserves some of the oldest evidence for hominid bipedalism. A key
question is the environment in which these bipeds lived. Here I examine environmental
change during the deposition of the Laetolil Beds (3.8-3.5 mya) where hominid remains and
preserved footprints have been recovered. An ecomorphological analysis of the bovid skeleton
evaluates the ability of each element to predict the preferred habitat types of the individuals.
Efficient habitat predictors are identified and an ecomorphological survey of these elements
from the Laetoli assemblage is conducted, thus providing a picture of the dominant habitat
types throughout the deposition of these beds.

Alternative ―sustainable development‖ strategies, including a return to ancient Maya cacao

In many ways, gravestones represent the answer to every archaeologist‘s dreams: artifacts that

I will explore alternative ways of researching gravestones, in which their potential as texts might

Research on the agricultural landscape of the Perry Mesa region of Central Arizona is important
in identifying the locations likely to demonstrate legacy effects from prehistoric farming. The
factors that influenced the distribution of agricultural activities are important in identifying the
ecological and social conditions under which human land use transforms ecosystems. An
assessment of agricultural sites in the region indicates a diverse strategy in field placement.
Additionally, results of a GIS model of potential agricultural land shows that large residential sites

[98] Assessing Artifact Standardization: Control or Constraint?
Paleoanthropologists cite standardization in stone tools as evidence for levels of cognitive
sophistication in Pleistocene hominids. Many treatments of artifact standardization are
undermined by (1) a loose definition of the concept itself, and (2) non-probabilistic standards for
comparing levels of standardization. The term ―standardization‖ implies imposed form, but what
we actually measure is simple variance in size and shape, which can be influenced by a range of
factors. This paper uses a resampling approach to comparing sample coefficients of variation
(cv) in order to assess how a range of factors may influence variation in sizes and shapes of
Middle Paleolithic artifacts.

Near Eastern Neolithic skull removal and plastering and construction of large anthropomorphic

personhood and embodiment that were visually centered on the head and face. Skull plastering
linked the social and physical body with the past, present and future projecting community
members forward and backwards in time. Manufacture, repeated use, and modification of these
objects as heirlooms illustrate a process of embedding personhood and materiality of social
bodies in the mundane and ritual spheres.

The Jemez Province experienced dramatic population growth following its settlement in AD

early Classic period settlement organization shared similarities with adjacent provinces, the

settlements in the Jemez emerged in upland settings, contra the abandonment of upland areas
across the northern Southwest by 1500. The formation and growth of Jemez communities was
driven by migration, but settlement organization was a product of contemporary regional
sociopolitical trends, and local environmental and economic conditions.

In early states sovereigns are gods, the less audacious royals their privileged intermediaries.

trump social and economic principles of kinship and egalitarian reciprocity in order to justify the

are important matters for middle-range theory in the archaeology of religion.

[48] Contextualizing Cosmology in the Preclassic: Interpreting the San Bartolo Sky Band
Sky bands are an integral part of Maya artwork, placing the scene in accordance with the
upper world. However there has never been a systematic comparison of sky bands in the
Preclassic. San Bartolo portrays a representation in context with murals pivotal to
understanding Preclassic ideology. The symbols present in the band repeatedly correspond
with the depictions above, while retaining similarities with fundamental sites such as Tikal and
Izapa. I will intensively compare San Bartolo's sky band with the mural, expanding upon
themes present in each, and evolving into a discussion of other Preclassic sky bands within
their particular contexts.

[239] Identifying Late Woodland Feasting Events in Southwestern Virginia: A
       Zooarchaeological Perspective
The identification of feasting activities in the zooarchaeological record of complex societies
where elite-sponsored feasts were important public events has become a much discussed topic
in recent literature. These studies have begun to define patterns of refuse disposal indicative of
feasting activities. When working with small-scale societies the question arises: Can these
same identifiers be applied to contexts where institutional ranking did not exist? This paper
considers one such context in the Late Woodland period in southwestern Virginia to gain better
insights into how feasts differed in small-scale societies compared to those held within
chiefdoms and early states.

[69] Modified Environments and the Utilization of Hill Tops in Northern Peru
Recent excavations at the site of Cerro Santa Rita in the Chao Valley of Peru have provided us
with some interesting and seemingly contradictory data. This paper proceeds from the idea that
during Gallinazo and Moche times hills were occupied either for defensive or ceremonial
reasons. The lack of any defensive implements on Cerro Santa Rita seems to indicate a
ceremonial purpose. The excavated evidence, however, suggests that the site was used
domestically. We propose that the current models of hill utilization are insufficient to address the
role that Cerro Santa Rita filled and we advocate for an alternate interpretation.

Archaeozoological research and ethnohistoric sources indicate that the white-tailed deer

new data from the Cerro Juan Díaz site, this poster summarizes the regional importance of these
taxa for food, materials, ornaments and in art, and inquires why they were able to withstand
human hunting pressure across a landscape, which was impacted by humans for several
thousand years.

Twenty years ago the evidence for indigenous maize agriculture in Rhode Island included
descriptions of Narragansett farming practices by European observers, stone hoes with no
provenience, and anecdotes. Without botanical evidence, was pre-European intensive maize
agriculture real or imagined? However, an archaebotanical record is now emerging, project by
project, due to fine extraction procedures. This cumulative record is described here. This small
record contributes to our understanding of farming practices in a coastal setting. Cultigens
appear in a discrete historical episode when settlements and activities significantly intensified,
while important 5000 year-old cultural practices persisted.

[116] The Emergence of Recuay Fortified Towns, North Highlands of Peru
During the latter half of the 1st millennium AD, densely populated centers developed in the
north central highlands of Peru, which were the seats of powerful ethnic groups, emerging out
of the Recuay tradition. At fortified settlements such as Yayno (Pomabamba), it is becoming
clearer that one of the major reasons for adopting town living was defense. Internecine conflict
and the threat of violence encouraged the aggregation of large groups into marginal hilltop
settings. Architectural data, building types and masonry in particular, indicate forms of Recuay
cultural production which valorized military leadership, community defense and intergroup
distinction.

The Swahili, who lived along the Eastern African coast from the 7th century AD onwards,
began converting to Islam in the 8th century. Clearly linked to an indigenous regional tradition,
their engagement with Islam and the expanding Indian Ocean world created a sense of
difference which marks Swahili identity to the present day. Historically, Swahili wealth and
practice of Islam led to their being targeted by Arab colonizers from the Persian Gulf. Later
European colonists classified them as separate from other African groups in the region, with
further implications for Swahili identity. This paper discusses archaeology‘s role in
understanding the changing content of Swahili identity in shifting colonial exigencies
particularly after AD 1500.

they were spatially individuated, architecturally varied and visually prominent. Maya iconographic

The emergence of archaeological interest in native copper in the mid-1800s developed in concert
with explanations that privileged the Lake Superior area over other potential sources of copper.
This paper challenges the dominant model for native copper procurement and presents trace
element data derived from INAA to reveal the extent to which Northeastern hunter-gatherers
utilized one dominant source of copper. I specifically report on the chemical characterization of
copper from 13 discrete geological deposits and 19 archaeological sites dating to the Late
Archaic and Early Woodland periods to suggest that the dominant model for native copper
procurement is oversimplified.

[69] The Role of Fortresses in Incan Expansion: Excavations at the Ecuadorian Site of Quitoloma
Incan expansion is well chronicled via the ethnohistoric and archaeological record. Nonetheless,
the specific nature of conflict and subjugation remain debated. Excavation at the Ecuadorian
fortress of Quitoloma is directed toward elucidating the dynamic nature of this conquest and the
exact mechanisms of incorporation. Preliminary evidence from Quitoloma sheds light on the
internal organization, function, length of occupation, and rate of abandonment of this massive
site and its role in the northern expansion of the Incan empire.

[47] Genetic Continuity of Prehistoric and Contemporary Communities in the South Central
      Andes Supported by Mitochondrial DNA
The comparison of ancient and modern mitochondrial DNA offers a nuanced approach to
examining the connections among prehistoric and contemporary communities. The
presented study uses mitochondrial DNA haplogroup data from skeletal material
originating from the sites of Chen Chen (~AD 850 to 1000) and Estuquiña (~AD 1300),
and compares these data to those from 55 other ancient and contemporary Native South
American communities. The comparisons support temporal and spatial genetic continuity
among several South Central Andean groups beginning prior to the Tiwanaku expansion.
The implications of these results for the origins and relationships of these groups are
discussed.

Archaeologists have collected a vast amount of landscape data from Thomas Jefferson's Poplar

Jefferson-period plantation and its many post-Jefferson alterations. Successive owners of Poplar
Forest chose to commemorate Jefferson through selective preservation and modification of the

The chronological sequence of central Amazon has been historically debated by competing
models concerning mobility patterns of prehistoric settlements and the cultural and historical
relationship between different ceramic complexes. The available data indicates that the first
sites with ceramic remains seem to appear in the area around 300 BC, culturally related to the
Barrancoid Tradition found in the Orinoco area (Venezuela). These evidences go strongly
against the hypothesis that this was an ancient center of ceramic production in the continent.

[114] Rethinking Urbanism: Cities of the Nomadic Khitan Empire in NE China (937-1109 AD)
Archaeologists always associate urbanism with the development of settled agrarian societies and
cities are regarded as the social, political, economic, and cultural centers. However, a close
examination of the process of urbanization of the Xilamulun valley during the Khitan period
reveals an opposite pattern. The valley was used as pastures for nomadic Khitans before the
establishment of the empire. During the expansion, the Khitans took a large population of
peasants and craftsmen from adjacent agricultural regions and resettled them in newly built
walled settlements. Based on this peculiar case I call for a new perspective to understand
urbanism.

[71] Fortifications and the Naissance of Political Dynamism in Southern Caucasia ( 2nd and 1st

Archaeological discussions of fortifications are traditionally tethered to a broader discourse on
warfare. Unlike the "City," which has undergone a sustained analytical critique destabilizing its
pretensions to singularity, the "Fortress" is often cast in unifunctionalist terms that cloak its
dynamic potential to produce complex sociopolitical landscapes. While not disregarding the
martial ambitions of their occupants, this paper examines how fortresses shaped and ordered the
social, political, and economic realities of ancient populations in southern Caucasia from the
initial period of wide-scale fortress construction in the Late Bronze Age through the region‘s
incorporation into the Urartian Empire.

The large tropical forest site of Palmitopamba in northwestern Ecuador provides an interesting
case study for neutron activation analysis (NAA) of pottery given the presence of three distinctive

there is Cosanga (aka "Panzaleo") pottery present in small quantities as well as Inca pottery and
features from the late 15th century expansion into northern Ecuador. Analyses indicate that
Yumbo potters probably were the makers of the provincial Inca wares, whereas the Cosanga
vessels are exotic. The cultural and historical implications of this will be addressed.

Many of the more common themes and figures in Moche iconography can be interpreted as
culture-specific symbols of what Carl Jung referred to as "archetypes." According to Jung, all
humans have common inherited patterns of emotional and mental behavior, or archetypes.
Symbolic manifestations of these archetypes, which include mythical and artistic themes and
figures, can therefore be found in the material remains of prehistoric societies with figurative
artistic traditions, such as the Moche. In this presentation, several well-known themes and
figures in Moche iconography are identified as symbols of Jungian archetypes. Their meaning is
then interpreted based on these identifications.

responded to local, regional, and interregional factors. Our political ecology perspective therefore
emphasizes environmental and agricultural change, diversity in settlement chronologies,
household level decision-making, sourcing and technological trends in material culture, and
urban trajectories reflecting elite strategies for integrating sustaining populations. Our approach
centralizes the moral component of negotiated relations between elites and non-elites, involving
reciprocal obligations and expectations, in viewing political life across the region and how it
changed throughout the Classic period.

meaningful interpretive tool if it incorporated contextualized socio-cultural perceptions of life
stages. This notion of ―social age‖ reflects the manner in which societies view an individual‘s role
in society, and can only determined through a multidisciplinary approach. Using ethnohistorical
data, biological age assessments and associated mortuary offerings, we propose several ―social
age‖ categories among the Chiribaya of Southern Peru.

[175] La Condición Profesional de la Arqueología
En los últimos años, a raíz de la aparición de legislación que regula la intervención urbana o
rural sobre sitios arqueológicos, se ha introducido una práctica de traslado de la actividad
arqueológica estrictamente académica a una actividad profesional ligada a propuestas
comerciales, de obras públicas u otros, que han cambiado la fisonomía de la arqueología como
quehacer.

[3] Counting the Prehistoric Maya: A Spatial Analysis of Structures at La Milpa, Belize
A recent population estimate for the Late/Terminal Classic period at the site of La Milpa used a
straightforward method of multiplying structures (excluding pyramidal or single-wall linear
structures) covering at least 15 square meters by 5 persons to extrapolate a figure of 62,166
persons for a 5km radius from the site center (after a 10% reduction for unoccupied structures).
The present study performs a multi-scalar analysis using Ripley‘s K-function on published La
Milpa settlement data to define possible residential units including clusters and ―farmsteads.‖
This analysis accounts for the spatial layout of Maya households for estimating prehistoric
populations.

[176] Virgin Islands Monserrate Complex: An Initial Understanding Emerges through Compliance
      Archaeology
Recent investigations on St. John, U.S. Virgin Islands, exemplify compliance processes that
substantially advance the understanding of prehistory, albeit within certain constraints. Two
projects in particular have provided data about the heretofore poorly known Monserrate
complex, commonly classified as early Elenan Ostionoid. Locally regulated mitigation work at
Calabash Boom was administered by the SHPO, while work at Trunk Bay was done at the
federal level by the Department of the Interior. Detailed vessel analysis describes the ceramic
style and enables study of diachronic development. Dating supports the need for adjustment
toward later dates in the post-Saladoid timescale.

polities of coastal Ecuador over the course of two millennia from the Late Formative through to
the pre-Contact Integration Period. We identify the principal commodities involved and trace their
archaeological visibility at different stages in the cycle of procurement, processing, exchange,
consumption and/or deposition. We conclude by addressing the dynamic relationship between
exchange and ritual in fuelling evolving social-political complexity.

Since 1994 we have investigated water chemistry and soils in wetlands and uplands of the Three
Rivers Region of Northwestern Belize, to record the rate and extent of environmental changes,
and to determine the interaction between the ancient Maya and their changing environment. We
highlight results from 2001-2005 fieldwork in Blue Creek and place them in the broader Lowland
Maya context. We present chemical, stratigraphic, and dating evidence that many regional
depressions have Preclassic (1200 BC - AD 200) or earlier paleosols, buried from 1-2 m by
ancient Maya induced erosion and from precipitating gypsum from rising groundwater.

[239] Late Prehistoric Ungulates in the Portland Basin: Implications for Conservation Biology
Roosevelt wapiti (Cervus elaphus roosevelti) from the Portland Basin dating between 1400 AD
and 1835 AD are larger than modern wapiti. Deer (Odocoileus spp.) are no different in size than
modern deer; size change in wapiti was not environmentally driven. Hybridization resulting from
translocation of Rocky Mountain wapiti (C. e. nelsoni) in the 1930s produced smaller individual
animals. Lack of change in abundances of Columbian black-tailed deer (O. hemionus
columbianus) and the federally protected Columbian white-tailed deer (O. virginianus leucurus)
coincident with decimation of the American Indian population suggests Euroamerican land use
jeopardized the latter subspecies.

[133] The Role of Mobility and Lithic Raw Material Availability in Determining Tool Kit Size and
       Degree of Retouch
Hunter-gatherers decide to replace or retouch existing tools depending on a variety of conditions.
Mobility and lithic raw material availability often determine the size of the tool kit and the extent of
tool retouch. In toolstone-rich settings, the size of curated toolkits and the degree of tool retouch
may decrease in favor of expedient tool use. In toolstone-deficient environments, increased
curated tool kit size and increased tool retouch likely reduced the risk of tool depletion. These
hypotheses on retouch versus replacement decisions are tested utilizing stone tool data from
prehistoric sites in the U.S. Mid-Atlantic region.

       Hair"
Bamana Segou was the last of a long tradition of Pre-Colonial Mande States. Its power was
founded upon "rights in persons" rather than in territory, and a breaking of stateless Mande
gerontocracy. Its army was composed largely of "slaves." In this paper we examine for the first
time archaeological traces of Segou's "Sifinso" or "Schools of the Black Hair," which likely served
as locations of indoctrination for young captive individuals. We also consider the origins and
broader political role of the Sifinso, and whether they were part of the initial policies of Biton
Kulubali (reigned c.1712-55) or subsequent rulers.

[95] Changes in Lambayeque Power Relations: The Perspective from Farfan
The 4 km site of Farfan was previously thought to have been built and inhabited only by the
Chimu Empire. However, recent research (1999-2004) revealed that the site was sequentially
occupied from the 11th to the 16th centuries by three polities--Lambayeque, Chimu and Inka.
Using Farfan as a venue, this study examines the changing power relations of the Lambayeque
polity before and after the conquest of the two Empires. As the original inhabitants of Farfan the
Lambayeque established a strong administrative presence. Their violent overthrow by the Chimu
state contrasts with their later reincorporation under the Inka Empire. The results of these power
fluctuations are manifested in the archaeological record in architecture, ceramics and burial
patterns.

FHUR 63 was a mummified individual housed at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas Collection
whose context had been lost. As part of a larger study, the remains of this individual were
analyzed using traditional physical anthropology techniques. That alone offered little information
about the individual‘s life. Using historic materials analysis, full recontextualization of the
individual was possible including, antiquity, ethnicity, habits, and occupation. Additionally,
application of ethnohistoric methods to the case allowed for construction of the individual‘s
narrative. This case shows that remains lacking context can be recontextualized, and the
resultant narrative proves the valuable information they retain.

of the Classic period (AD 400-650). The proximity of the site to the coast as well as to a variety of
ecological areas facilitated participation in regional and interregional exchange networks and
created favorable conditions for large numbers of residents to move into an otherwise
agriculturally poor area.

The process of animal domestication involves several choices in animal exploitation strategies.
This research takes a completely new approach to investigating animal domestication processes
by focusing on the role of fodder provisioning in early animal husbandry practices. Fodder
provisioning, where humans obtain foodstuffs for animals in the form of either wild or cultivated
plant material for the purposes of increasing the reliability and predictability of animal resources,
was likely a crucial aspect of emergent animal husbandry practices. Using carbon and nitrogen
stable isotopic analyses, emergent foddering practices in goats are investigated in Southern
Levantine Pre-Pottery Neolithic contexts.

[219] LA-ICPMS Analysis of Ceramics from Pueblo Viejo (Lurin, Peru): Discussion of Results
It is often assumed in ceramic studies that there is a direct relationship between style and
ethnic identity. In this paper, the spatial/temporal distribution of ceramic styles from Pueblo
Viejo-Pucara, an Inca period settlement in the Lurin valley of Peru, is considered instead as the
reflection of the political, economic and ideological relations in society. Potters can mimic, copy
or borrow forms, finishing techniques and designs, while maintaining their paste recipes.
Therefore, in order to map the boundaries of ethnic identity, we employ the concept of
technological tradition as a better indicator than style.

The general idea behind embodied cognition is quite simple; the body is not a passive container

not inhabit the body, it is rather the body that inhabits the mind as the main perturbatory channel
through which the constitutive intertwining of cognition with material culture is effected. In this
paper using examples from the Aegean of the late Bronze Age I want to explore the implications
of such a thesis for the archaeology of mind and the category of the Mycenaean person.

Our presentation will deal with groups who developed in the Rapayán Valley during the LIP/LH.
In 2001 and 2002, we conducted a survey covering 320 km² during which we studied 55 sites.
The well preserved households at these sites possess large niches that were constructed to host
the remains of the dead. Excavations conducted in 2005 confirmed that the living systematically
cohabited with the deceased within each household. This very particular pattern will be
compared to the ones found in neighboring valleys in order to explore matters of social identity in
the Upper Marañón drainage at large.

Preceramic studies in the Central Andes began in the 1940s, but gained momentum in the late

resource exploitation begin, and how did it affect the emergence of complex societies? and (2)
what was the relationship between coastal and highland groups in each area, related also to
the development of complexity and exchange of ideology? Related questions involved the role
of climate change and eustatic sea level rise. This symposium will present both synthetic
papers and new data that advance our understanding of this significant time period.

      from Xuenkal, Yucatan, Mexico
Although Chichen Itza's center has been extensively studied, few investigations have examined
its constituent secondary centers. Proyecto Arqueologico Xuenkal seeks to systematically
investigate the nature of Chichen Itza's influence over Xuenkal, the Cupul region's largest
settlement. Xuenkal's control likely held both economic importance, owing to locally dense
natural resources, and political significance, given Xuenkal's strategic location halfway between
Chichen and Isla Cerritos plus near rival polity Ek Balam. Initial findings suggest that
longstanding regional patterns of architecture and settlement were favored over replication of
Chichen-style architectural groups. We present preliminary research results from Xuenkal and
evaluate them within a regional perspective.

Smoking ―une pipe‖ was more than simply a leisurely practice among Canadian voyageurs.
Rather, smoking played an active role in the struggle over the terms and conditions of the fur
trade workplace. Clay pipes were key material symbols of male Canadien identity and were even
celebrated in the voyaguer‘s chansons—songs used to keep time as they paddled. Fur trade
elites (the bourgeois), however, tended to link smoking with ―laziness,‖ a powerful trope in

Thermal diffusivity is a measure of the ease with which heat is transferred through a vessel's
walls. Pots with high diffusivity are very effective for boiling and simmering, techniques often
used to cook starchy seeds to increase their palatability and digestibility. Changes in ceramic
attributes related to heating effectiveness may reflect dietary changes associated with a greater
reliance on starchy plant cultigens. Sherds from the Gartner Site were tested to compare the
heating effectiveness of Woodland and Fort Ancient period pottery. The data may shed light on
the shift to a maize-based economy in late prehistoric Ohio.

LIP settlements at Rapayán are characterized by various types of above ground mortuary
constructions. Among these, the large multistory buildings, which were constructed to host the
founding ancestor of each community, contrasts with the LIP Andean panorama because of their
truly monumental scale. The emergence and the distribution of such monuments throughout the
Rapayán landscape provide information into how ancestor veneration ideology and claims of
primordial descent were increasingly being manipulated in order to reach political ends. The
Rapayán data thus provide insights into how the widespread pattern of ancestor veneration
participated locally into a process of growing political complexity.

and perhaps Guerrero, that may have competed with the state political economy.

occurred in Central European Neolithic and the manner in which they were embedded in larger
social associations. It is argued that household became autonomous and clearly bonded entity

are the result of the interaction of economical, political, and ideological goals. We wonder if the
changes in agricultural systems are expressions of the strategies' economic goals or if they are
the expression of contact with a specific environment. The main concern is how the strategies
shape changes in environments or how the environments shape the strategies. We will use three

[141] A Bioarchaeological Analysis of Bodrogkeresztúr Burials from Gyula 114, Hungary
This poster will present mortuary data from Gyula 114, a Middle Copper Age site located in
Southeastern Hungary. Both archaeological and biological data will be presented regarding the
prehistoric human health, mortuary practices and social patterns of this region. In particular,
local burial patterns, epigenetic variation, and dental pathologies will be addressed.

[113] Early Formative Public Architecture in Southeastern Uruguay, La Plata Basin
This paper examines the social construction and transformation of early Formative circular-
shaped mound complexes in southeastern Uruguay during the mid-Holocene around 4000 BP.
Archaeological site layouts, the role of public/plaza spaces, and the elaboration of differential
mounded architecture are discussed. The circular villages of the ethnographically documented
Ge and Arawak groups of lowland South America are used as a point of departure to explore the
social and political organization of these early Formative communities.

[71] The Kurgan Complex: Coming to Terms with Middle Bronze Age Burials in the Volga-Ural
     Region
Bronze Age Archaeology in Russia relies on the study of burial mounds. These monumental
burial sites have been used to explain everything from the spread of language groups to socio-
political complexity. During the Middle Bronze Age in the Volga-Ural region the ostentatious
kurgan burials are the basis of particular arguments about social hierarchy and modes of
production. This paper will examine two kurgan burials that look roughly similar, but are
interpreted as belonging to two separate cultures with seemingly different settlement and
subsistence strategies. These interpretations affect not only how settlements are interpreted but
how cultures are defined.

     Excavations at Lambityeco, Macuilxóchitl and Xaagá
We report on recently completed large-scale excavations in three Valley of Oaxaca Prehispanic
communities spanning the Early Postclassic (AD 800-1200) to Early Colonial Periods (AD 1521-
1600). The excavation of a large number of residences and activity areas from Lambityeco,
Macuilxóchitl and Xaagá provide information on changing household specialization during this
interval. We reflect on the utility of world systems theory in accounting for these changes.

[84] MtDNA Clues to the Peopling of the Caribbean
The haplogroup identity of 489 Amerindian mitochondria) DNAs (mtDNAs) from Puerto Rico
were obtained through RFLP. Haplogroup A (52.4%) was shown to be the most frequent,
followed by haplogroups C (35.6%), B (8.6%) and D (3.5%). Studies involving coding region
RFLP, control region sequencing, and comparative analysis with Amerindian mtDNAs from
elsewhere suggested that approximately 13% of Amerindian mtDNAs in Puerto Rico originate
from outside of the island. Furthermore, only 7-8 maternal lineages gave rise to the Puerto Rico
Tainos and at least 2-3 of them arrived by way of Hispaniola. One was identified as South
American in origin.

[16] American Gold and European Brass: An Archaeometallurgical Study of Ornaments
     from the Cemetery of El Chorro de Maíta, Cuba
This paper outlines the results of the first systematic analytical study conducted on
archaeological metals from Cuba, using ED-XRF, optical microscopy and SEM-EDS. The main
focus of the study consists of body ornaments excavated at the large cemetery of El Chorro de
Maíta, Cuba. Some comparative samples from the nearby site of Alcala were also investigated,
with an emphasis made on the manufacture, composition and origins or the different alloys. The
results of this archaeometallurgical approach offer fresh insight into the relationships between
the Europeans and the indigenous populations, their trade systems and the influence exerted by
the colonisers on local customs and values.

[177] The Political Economy of Mayapan
Our distribution analysis of artifacts from hundreds of residential groups at Mayapan identifies
concentrations indicative of occupational specialization across the city. These data also attest
to occupational duration and intensity, which lessened with distance from the site's monumental
center. To assess the relationship between production behavior and social class, we analyze
artifact distributions associated with different types and size classes of domestic groups. We
argue that production in basic goods was commonplace at Mayapan, by extension, a relatively
autonomous political economy is reflected. Implicit in these patterns is the guiding hand of
Mayapan's governors in centralizing production at the city.

economic and political interactions at the site.

[219] Ceramic Production and Societal Change in the Manteno of Coastal Ecuador
Elaborate black-polished ceramics mark the Manteno style of late period coastal Ecuador.
Stylistic similarities in these decorated wares suggest the Manteno system may have included
the spread of new ritual practices with centralized ceramic production and trade. Alternatively
these ceramics may be evidence of elite emulation or even the establishment of Manteno
enclaves. Analyses of Manteno ceramics and local resources using INAA and petrographic
analysis provide information on these related issues of the origin and nature of Manteno
society. Results suggest that local production continued with central coast centers as sources
of storage jars and fineware ceramics.

[250] Utilitarian Bone Button Classification: A Technological Approach
In North America, utilitarian bone buttons are primarily associated with eighteenth and nineteenth
century contexts. This, combined with a classification scheme reliant upon buttonhole number,
button diameter, and face recess presence, has served as a rudimentary chronology. This
scheme is too simplistic and discounts advances in past technology. Using U.S. Patent archives
and technological data, a taxonomic structure is proposed for utilitarian bone buttons based upon
the recognition of physical characteristics with incident light and scanning electron microscopy.
The intention is to emphasize the potential of using technological characteristics in revising the
chronological scheme for these artifacts.

three alternative models are considered: 1) formal cremation and intentional scattering; 2.
intentional burning; or 3) accidental inclusion with other refuse.

An impressive number of Late Preceramic (2800 - 1800 BC) sites have recently been
documented in the Fortaleza Valley of Central Coastal Peru. This paper presents an analysis of
the spatial orientation and directionality of these occupations, with particular attention to
geographic location, overall site layout, and volume and height of structures. Such comparisons

[79] Cultural Responses to Short-Term Environmental Fluctuations: Late Prehistoric Adaptation
     on San Nicolas Island, California
Testing at a midden site on San Nicolas Island, southern California, produced a wealth of
features indicative of repeated short-term occupations over a period of several hundred years.
Evidence strongly suggests that this occupation overlapped and included one or more El Niño
events. Analysis of these features and associated material remains suggests that human
response to this environmental fluctuation involved only a ―tweaking‖ of routine behaviors, rather
than a dramatic shift in social structure. This serves as a marked contrast to evidence from the
northern Channel Islands, where societal change is seen as a direct result of environmental
stress.

[207] New Perspectives on the Origins of Monumentality in the Northern Maya Lowlands
Recent research has produced new evidence on the origins of monumentality in the northern
Maya lowlands. It is now known that by the second half of the Middle Formative (800-400 BC)
there was widespread occupation throughout the region. Site hierarchies, ball courts,
monumental architecture and the construction of sacbes are found. Also at several centers huge
acropolises were constructed. This paper examines the origins of monumentality in this region
and how it relates to events in greater Mesoamerica. It also discusses what the evidence
indicates about the rise of sociopolitical complexity in the northern Maya lowlands.

[46] Historical Context: The Antiquities Act and the Enactment of the Archaeological Resources
Protection Act
The 1974 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that the Antiquities Act was unconstitutionally
vague caused the use of the general federal theft and injury to government property statutes in
a major looting case that occurred in Arizona in 1977. When the judge in this case dismissed
the property statute charges based on his interpretation of the purpose of Congress in
enacting the Antiquities Act, archaeological sites in the vast Ninth Judicial Circuit were left
unprotected from looting and vandalism. This led directly to the enactment of the
Archaeological Resources Protection Act in 1979.

[207] Ritual Works: Monumental Architecture and Generative Schemes of Power in the Lowland
      Maya Preclassic Period
The onset of monumental architecture provides an unequivocal signal of societal change in the
Maya lowlands, the colossal pyramids of the Preclassic period are distinct from those of the
Classic period due to their modeled stucco facades and absence of royal tombs. A survey of the
attributes of Preclassic pyramids suggests that the cosmological authentication of early rulers
was of critical concern as was the construction of a novel architectural form that became an
extremely durable inalienable possession (as per Weiner 1992). Arguably, inscribing such
features on the landscape cemented social memory of hierarchy and diminished challenges to
economic difference.

some of the methodological problems inherent in constructing these comparative frameworks.
This paper primarily settles on refitting rate as a way of making comparisons across
excavations of various sizes, densities of artifacts, and various other archaeological
characteristics. While far from perfect, I suggest that systematic refitting considering all aspects
of assemblages and presentation of refitting rate offer promising avenues in terms of making
inferences from various refitting patterns.

[128] Enemies and Ancestors: Iron Age Head-hunting in Southern France
The concept of a "Celtic cult of the head" as the prime instance of cultural and institutionalised
head-hunting in Europe has its roots in the ancient Greek and Roman texts. Early this century,
skulls were discovered, some with nails still embedded, at southern French sites which, in light
of these ancient sources, were interpreted simply as trophies taken from fallen enemies, a
savage and primitive practice which became an integral part of the pan-Celtic repertoire of
warlike characteristics. Conversely study of the sites which produce these remains appears to
suggest an elaborate set of practices expressing identity, territory and power.

Huauhtzontli, a cultivated chenopod distributed throughout the highlands of Central Mexico, is
generally assumed to have been domesticated prior to the Spanish Conquest. This interpretation
may be rooted in the association with the modern domesticate cited in English translations of
some sixteenth century historical and ethnohistorical documents. Morphometric analysis of
modern fruits of the central Mexican subspecies of C. berlandieri, and a revision of
archaeological specimens spanning Middle Formative through Late Postclassic occupations,
suggests that archaeological remains of C. berlandieri from this region were not domesticated.
We explore implications for prehispanic plant use, culinary traditions and domestication of

relationship between fishing and the development of sedentism and social complexity. Moving
beyond calories, the intensification of fishing efforts during the Holocene created new social
mechanisms designed to deal with the harsh realities of maritime subsistence. This study uses

[229] The Copper "Cache" as an Analytical Unit: Testing Entrenched Assumptions
Most studies of Early and Middle Woodland copper exchange focus on the individual artifact
as the primary unit of analysis. By focusing instead on entire copper "caches," several long-
accepted assumptions and misconceptions are challenged. Quantifying and mapping copper-
bearing sites, copper objects, and artifact types shows that copper caches and many artifact
forms are more widespread than commonly perceived. Through trace-element work one can
assess the notion that raw copper was procured exclusively from the Great Lakes.
Furthermore, the common perception of expansive "trade-networks" can be tested against
simpler models of copper transport.

[41] The Celtic Invasion of Ireland: Myth or Fact?
This study focuses on the transition period from the Late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age in
Ireland, which recently has come under some debate. The Late Bronze Age is defined as
lasting from 1200-500 BC, and the Early Iron Age is 500 BC to the beginning of the Common
Era. The transitional period under discussion, lasting from 600-300 BC, was originally known
as the time when Ireland became Celtic. This study suggests that the Late Bronze Age of
Ireland was marked by cultural continuity rather than invasion or large-scale replacement of
key features.

[210] Pre-Columbian Landscape Transformation at Copan, Honduras
A high-resolution sediment core extracted from the laguna Petapilla, 6 km from the heart of the
ancient Acropolis, records information on nearly 3000 years of ecological transformations in the
Copan valley. Analysis of the core reveals a record significantly different from what earlier
ecologists have found; rather than a large degree of deforestation at the end of the Classic, the
greatest periods of deforestation occur during the Early Preclassic and Early Classic. Data from
the sediment core encourages a reexamination of the reasons for the political collapse of the
Copan kingdom.

[43] Woodland-Era Clay Procurement in the Carolinas: A Chemical and
     Mineralogical Study of Ceramics and Raw Clays
Neutron activation (NAA), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and petrographic analyses of pottery, clay,
and temper reveal regional distinctions in Woodland-era procurement strategies in the Carolina
Piedmont, Sandhills, and Coastal Plain. NAA and petrography indicate that vessels found on
Sandhills sites were not locally manufactured. NAA, XRD, and petrographic results further
discriminate non-Sandhills source-area locations, while replication experiments demonstrate
that Sandhills clays lack the plasticity essential for pottery making. These results indicate that
pottery circulated over broad regions, suggesting high levels of residential mobility and implying
that the acquisition of clay from distant sources was a critical feature of Woodland-era
subsistence.

1959, there has been interest as to when people may have first settled on the California
Channel Islands. The original radiocarbon dating of the remains found at Arlington Springs
raised questions and controversy. Re-dating of the bone collagen and investigation of the site's
chronostratigraphy places the age of the remains in excess of 13,000 cal. BP. Recently, a
ground penetrating radar survey of the site was conducted with promising results. This study
seeks to determine if the acquired GPR data can contribute to a reconstruction of the Late
Pleistocene landscape in the vicinity of the Arlington Springs site. This information sheds light
on the secondary deposition of the remains previously discovered. Also, subsurface anomalies
were detected that hold the promise for further discoveries at Arlington Springs in pending
fieldwork. This project not only holds the potential for new research in the studies of occupation
during the Late Pleistocene along the American West Coast, but also the method employed.

[248] Reconsidering Everglades Prehistory: Recent Geological and Archeological Evidence for
       Holocene Variability and Early Human Settlement
Previous researchers on working on Everglades tree islands often encountered a hardened
layer (Calcrete?), but few have ever sampled below it or explained its origin. Recent
investigations have determined this formation is widespread, and well-preserved organic soil
and Archaic period archeological remains are present beneath it. Radiocarbon dating indicates
formation sometime between 4000 and 2700 BP. Absence of artifacts in the calcrete layer
suggests settlement of tree islands shifted, or followed changes in climate or environmental
conditions. This paper explores the geological origin of the layer, and its archeological
implications to prehistoric models of settlement in the Everglades.

[64] An Ethnoarchaeological Perspective on the Utilization of Cave Space
In his study of Santa Eulalia in 1932, Oliver LaFarge suggested that the cave, Yalan Na‘, was
"the true center of the ceremonial" even though he was never permitted into the cave. Recent
ethnohistorical and ethnographic investigations allow us to verify this and present a far more
detailed picture of cave utilization. The cave is not a unitary feature but contains a number of
spatially separated loci of ritual activity, each dedicated to a distinct function. The separation
suggests ritual circuits within the cave. The data may provide a useful model for interpreting
Pre-Columbian cave use.

Recent work in Chavín de Huántar has greatly expanded the area sampled and the amount of

wattle and daub structures, plastered walls, and even molded friezes that were part of the
monumental architecture of the ceremonial center. More significantly, the large ceramic sample,
coming from well-stratified and datable deposits, suggests the need for refinement of the ceramic
chronology of Chavín.

Archaeologists must recognize that extant architecture serves more than the pragmatic function

and suggests that ancient structures represent the sum of a series of deliberate choices, some
influenced by practical considerations and others motivated by cultural practice and aesthetic
preference. It further proposes that by exploring what guides and constrains these choices,
archaeologists can begin to inquire into the meanings of different architectural forms and styles,
including what they communicate, while also placing them within a broader historic and cultural
framework.

Although sacrificial rites are graphically illustrated at Chichen Itza, less attention has been paid to
ceremonies involving fire and water even though the site's texts frequently mention burning
events and the Sacred Cenote was the locus of intense ritual activity. Furthermore, Chichen's
imagery sometimes focuses on fire and water as well. Water and fire rites are both deeply rooted
in Mesoamerica, the latter particularly well-documented in central highland Mexico in all periods.
Architectural features and offerings at both Chichen and Tula clearly demonstrate that the two
centers shared similar beliefs and ritual behavior. In addition, Chichen's art shows that fire and
water rites were closely entwined with warfare and human sacrifice.

Theories of colonialism and modernity often present divergent ways of understanding how

appropriated goods and labor from each other, and (4) the variable practices of indigenous
resistance. These intersections are illustrated through a discussion of the Pueblos of the North

Archaeological skeletons provide considerable information on health in the past, although much

communities. Here I enlarge upon the so-called Osteological Paradox that, among other issues,
draws a distinction between mortality and living samples. In particular, heterogeneity within
populations is detected by identifying "at risk" groups in mortality samples using accidental and
purposeful trauma in medieval to early modern Danish skeletons.

[111] Bodily Beliefs at the Dawn of Agriculture in Western Asia
We examine the rich record of human and animal bodies and body parts (contextual case
studies and an overview of the burial records) to explore how bodily beliefs changed from the
Natufian through Pottery Neolithic in the Levant, Western Asia. We examine the composition and
frequency of "mixed" burials (human-animal, multiple humans) and the partibility of bodies.
These analyses are used to elucidate the perceived boundaries of the human body and the
manner and contexts in which these boundaries were negotiated or violated, and variability in
time and space in cultural patterns in the presentation and treatment of human bodies.

Desde 1960 la arqueología mexicana realiza investigaciones interdisciplinarias en laboratorios
especializados. Entre los estudios realizados está el del sitio ―La Amapola‖, Cedral, un viejo
manantial, donde se conformó un yacimiento paleontológico pleistocénico que fue excavado
y, en la primera temporada, se localizó un hogar fechado en 31,859±1,600 aP (I-10483). Las
representaciones faunísticas, florísticas, los estudios estratigráficos, geológicos y
geomorfológicos van de alrededor de 40,000 aP a la actualidad. Se localizaron burdos
artefactos líticos y cinco hogares más, cuyos fechamientos van hacia 30,000 aP.

[35] What's the Point?: Reconsidering Culture-Historic Taxa in the Late Archaic
Rigid adherence to culture histories has masked important regional variability and limited
questions regarding cultural diversity and social dynamics during the Late Archaic in the
Northeast. Considering multiple regional/ subregional histories allows for innovative
interpretations of complex hunter-gatherers. Analysis of projectile point variability at the Castle
Gardens site serves as one case study challenging traditional culture-historic frameworks that
describe the relationship between the Vestal and Lamoka Phases in the Allegheny Plateau
region of the Northern Appalachians. Statistical modeling of contemporaneous Vestal and
Lamoka points examines the possibility of stylistic differences related to intra-and inter-group
identity formation, interaction, representation, and reproduction.

[204] Reconstructing Midden Composition through Chemical Analysis of Soils in the Eastern
      Aleutians
In order to characterize the chemical signatures of middens with differing faunal remains this
study determined chemical compositions of soils collected from middens from two Aleutian
islands, Sanak and Unalaska Islands, Alaska. Concentrations of Al, Ba, Ca, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, P,
Sr, Ti, and Zn from 200 samples were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma-mass
spectrometer (ICP-MS). Results show this type of research could be utilized to determine the
presence and possibly faunal composition of middens at older sites in the Aleutians that no
longer contain organic remains.

[187] Communities of Practice in Seventeenth-Century Mandan Craft Production
Mandan craft production was a specialized activity in the early nineteenth century. Manufacturing
techniques were proprietary and the right to practice particular trades was restricted. Novice
arrow makers, potters, or boat builders acquired their technical knowledge by entering into
socially-sanctioned apprenticeships with established producers. Less is known about how craft
production was organized in the early Contact period. Data on the techniques of pottery
manufacture are used to determine whether the nineteenth-century practice of specialized
production was in place during the seventeenth century. Changes in the organization of craft
production during the Contact period may signal new economic patterns.

[111] Fresh Scars on the Body of Archaeology: An Archaeologist's Encounter with Forensic
      Anthropology
Forensic experts including a team of archaeologists examined bodies from the grim atrocity site
of Batajnica near Belgrade. It was suspected that the hundreds of bodies from several graves
originated from different events and from different places in Kosovo and Metohija. Sorting
through human debris archaeologists looked for clues to how people died and to their identities,
and also tried to detach the daily life from the clothed bodies in the ground that went together
with it. This paper discusses the complex relationship between the sensual and bodily imprints,
and the life on site during the process of exhumation.

Empires maintain themselves through processes of taxation and redistribution of commodities;

of Hacinebi in southeastern Turkey, examining, not only the pastoral practices of the occupants
of the site, but also the relationship of these pastoral practices to the larger Achaemenid and
Hellenistic imperial exchange system, both locally and on a regional level. This study will shed
light on the ways in which small settlements, largely ignored in the historical record, were
incorporated into the wider economic organization of empires.

[162] Macroscopic Traces and Technological Behaviour of the Middle Palaeolithic Lithic Points
      in Payre (SE-France): Projectiles or Hand Tools?
The site of Payre has yielded several human occupations dated to the OIS 7 and 5 and
associated to human remains. Half of the 15% of retouched flint products are retouched points.
A large part of these tools and numerous unretouched triangular flakes have macroscopic
traces: crushing marks on the cutting edges, fractures and micro-removals on the tips. Such
traces, by their location and diversity suggest functional areas on the same pieces and a great
variability of use. New perspectives are opened again on the debate: is there evidence of lithic
projectile points in the European Mousterian?

[190] The Western Precinct of the Holmul Palace: A Snapshot of Changing Elite Activity
In 2005, work continued in the palace at Holmul. Efforts were concentrated on the western, or
rear, area of the palace. Using an analysis of architecture and the use of space, coupled with
artifact analyses, it becomes evident that substantial changes in behavior occurred from the Late
to Terminal Classic periods. By looking at the way architecture influenced paths of movement
and cued behavior, the western precinct is understood in its context of the palace as a whole.
Terminal Classic deposits subsequently indicate that during this period activities conflicted with
the architectural morphology.

[141] Mitochondrial DNA Evidence Supports Historic Documentation of Yavapai-Apache
      Interaction
Historic evidence, dating back to the 16th century, suggests that the Western Apache and
Eastern Yavapai had established strong cultural ties through reciprocal trade, military alliances,
and intermarriage, despite speaking entirely unrelated languages. While previous mitochondrial
DNA (mtDNA) studies suggested that gene flow between Athabaskan and Yuman speaking
groups of the Southwest was unidirectional, with women marrying into the former, we conducted
a more extensive study of Yavapai mtDNA variation to address this claim. We found that a
substantial portion of Yavapai maternal lineages are ultimately of Athabaskan origin, suggesting
that Yavapai-Apache interaction was more dynamic than previously detected.

Current perspectives on the development of complex societies increasingly acknowledge that

Kingdom of Dahomey in Atlantic era West Africa provides a rich context in which to explore this
issue. Historical and archaeological evidence from Dahomean royal palace sites is rallied to
argue that elite power strategies in Dahomey began to shift from "individualistic" to "corporate"
strategies over the course of the seventeenth through nineteenth centuries. This resulted from
changing inter-elite dynamics caused by the shifting economic opportunities presented by the
Atlantic commerce in this period.

The inception of farming in Southern Europe continues to be a topic of controversy. Research
at Danilo on the initial stages of farming and village life is designed to elucidate this problem.
Excavations at Danilo have yielded significant samples of charred plant remains and animal
bones that provide primary data for the economy of the site. Preliminary results indicate that the
inhabitants depended on farming. Artifacts and structures suggest considerably more spatial
variation at the site than expected. AMS dating of Danilo indicates that present understanding
of the Dalmatian Neolithic cultural sequence and chronology may need to be revised.

[113] Modes of Religious Authority and Forms of Ritual Architecture: Ethnographic
       Comparisons, Archaeological Implications
A comparative study of ethnographic cases from South America suggest a correlation between
modes of religious authority and forms of ritual architecture. Drawing on the work of Lawrence
Sullivan, three modes of religious authority are defined: ecstatic shamanism, mediums, and
canonists. Ritual architecture associated with these different modes of religious authority vary in
terms of key variables regarding the permanence, ubiquity, and visibility. A comparison of
ethnographic cases indicates that ecstatic shamanism is associated with ritual architecture
which is relatively impermanent, widely distributed among settlements, and reflects relatively
intimate and visible interactions. In contrast, religious authority based control of a canon of
sacred knowledge is associated with ritual architecture that is relatively permanent, distributed
among relatively few settlements, and may encompass both intimate and distant interactions.
The implications of this correlation are relevant for understanding the emergence of ritual
architecture in early Andean societies.

[98] Lithic Design Space and Cognition
Stone flaking is achieved through integral sets of geometrical identifications and motor actions
collectively referred to as the "flake unit." Since motor actions share a neural substrate with
language, evolutionary changes in the complexity of motor actions can track changes in cognitive
complexity. Motor action complexity is tracked in two ways: by analyzing internal flake unit
changes and by exploring flake unit combinations. In early evolutionary history—e.g., Oldowan
techniques, handaxe manufacture, the Levallois method—hominins elaborated the internal
structure of flake units but combined them simply. Complex combinations of flake units appear in
the later Middle Pleistocene.

Archaeologists studying children‘s toys have consistently viewed them as a means by which

southeastern Colorado, however, the companies who ran the camps took on many parenting
duties, including education, medical care, and even giving Christmas gifts to the children of their
workers. Using items recovered from excavated sites, this paper examines the role that toys
may have played in the company‘s program of Americanization of these recent immigrants
especially regarding gender roles and American ideals of beauty and gentility.

[196] Archaic Art, Living Art, and the Interpretive Gap: A View from Brazil
Ethnography is used, abused, and even eschewed in rock art research. Indigenous knowledge of
recent rock art traditions can significantly inform interpretation. Conversely, when a dozen or
more millennia separate the rock art from the living traditions, ethnographic analogy is frail or
useless. Brazil offers a unique situation. In many cases, the arts of the Brazilian Indians have
only been impacted by European contact for less than a century, while the rock art of Brazil
includes probably the oldest art in the Americas. This paper illustrates how persistent living
traditions can inform the interpretation of Archaic Brazilian rock art.

distinctions in forms of and access to ecological knowledge. Paleoethnobotanical data from

variability derived from the position of social actors, as well as their everyday and ritual
practices, within multi-scalar political economic milieus.

goods and, in the process, materialized social relations between members of the Palmarejo
community. Based on the style and substance of the vase, along with its context as mortuary
furniture, we infer that gift exchange may have provided a mechanism to embed social relations
in ritual contexts.

enough ideological capital to finance such an emotionally and economically wrenching mortuary
rite.

were an important political resource during this crucial period of the consolidation of elite political
power.

[186] Interwoven Destinies: Post-Colonial Identities and the Archaeology of Colonialism
This paper explores the interwoven destinies of contemporary archaeologists, the people they
study, and the descendents of those people. With the archaeology of Sylvester Manor as a
starting point, this paper examines the connections between this Long Island plantation and
the two sugar plantations on Barbados it helped to provision during the seventeenth century.
Archaeological evidence of cultural interaction between European, Native American and
possibly enslaved Africans from Sylvester Manor is interpreted within a post-colonial
framework informed by discussions with Long Island Native populations and the descendents
of slave populations who worked on the still operating plantations on Barbados.

[14] Pedologic and Geomorphic Evidence for Pre-Hispanic Extensive Anthropogenically-
     induced Soil Erosion in the Nochixtlán Valley, Oaxaca, Mexico
Extensive erosion in the Nochixtlán Valley has been seen as the result of post-European
landuse changes. Regional geomorphology and paleopedology surveys indicate otherwise.
Radiocarbon dating of 32 buried paleosols indicates erosion and deposition occurred
repeatedly, well before European contact. Erosion episodes are associated with periods of
population growth, and agricultural expansion in the valley. Radiocarbon dates from truncated
paleosols indicate that a change from stream deposition to incision occurred prior to European
contact. Surveys have also discovered Archaic sites confirmed by radiocarbon dates of
associated soils. We discuss the implications of our research for the discovery of additional
Archaic sites.

[215] Gazelle Bone Marrow Yields and Epipaleolithic Animal Exploitation Strategies in the
       Southern Levant
We investigate the bone marrow yields of mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella) to reconstruct
human resource exploitation strategies and carcass utilization during the Epipalaeolithic of the
southern Levant. We present experimentally derived data on the bone marrow content of four
gazelle carcasses, discuss variation in marrow yields, and compare the new data to gazelle
skeletal element abundances from five Epipaleolithic assemblages from Israel. Human
processing of bones for marrow is the primary cause of bone survivorship and fragmentation.
Intraspecific variability in marrow yields related to the sex and physiological condition of modern
gazelles suggests seasonal variation in prehistoric animal exploitation.

This paper discusses the available evidence for religious practices in the Prepalatial and

an increase in the evidence for religious rituals in the settlements suggesting a shift in the
location and function of religion in south central Crete.

The Hohokam Water Management simulation, a computer model of irrigation, agriculture, and

use of modeling within a process of theory building and concept exploration. The framework
allows us to ask specific kinds of questions that many other archaeological models have not
permitted, including "what-if" questions about alternative trajectories of the past. This approach
is appropriate and arguably necessary to the consideration of a past society as a complex
system. We describe this philosophy and illustrate the benefits of this approach with results

Specialists generally agree that the primary language recorded in Mayan hieroglyphs is
Ch'olan. However, Classic period hieroglyphs spelled in Yukatekan were also widespread
throughout the southern Maya Lowlands. This paper synthesizes the quantity, temporality, and
spatial extent of Yukatek spellings in Classic Period texts. Language is an important
mechanism actors use to identify themselves with particular social groups. The use and
distribution of Yukatek spellings suggest they functioned, in part, as markers of ethnic identity
throughout the Classic and Postclassic periods. These data have important new implications
for our understandings of elite interactions and political organization in the Maya Lowlands.

[6] Conservation Implications of New Zealand Fur Seal Pup Remains
Prior to human colonization of New Zealand, fur seal populations were estimated to be in the
tens of millions. With prehistoric human predation and historic sealing, fur seal populations
dramatically declined to a historic low of 10,000 individuals. Currently, fur seals are rebounding
and expanding their range. Wildlife management agencies are interested in identifying coastline
for potential new rookeries to target for protection. Archaeological data can aid in this effort by
identifying locations of prehistoric rookeries. Morphometric data on prehistoric fur seal
assemblages are used to identify population structure, in particular the presence of pre-weaned
pups indicative of rookeries.

[111] Embodiments in Action: Neo-Assyrian Apotropaic Figurine Worlds
This paper explores Neo-Assyrian apotropaic figurine practice as a technology of protection.
Specifically, I consider how these rituals mediated the foundational notion that humans were
created as servants to the gods. While this relationship established certain proper notions of
subject, citizen and social agency, in practice, humans employed various techniques to
negotiate and reform these ideals. In this vein I discuss apotropaic figurines as a complex
mediation of the relationship between the creation of image and body and the power of the
disembodied (the supernatural, divine, mythic and dead) and how it conferred protection in the

For the last 5 years, investigations by the Proyecto Arqueologico Copan (PROARCO) have

Copan Valley was notably augmented. PROARCO found the first royal tomb to be discovered
outside of the Acropolis, dating to the early 6th century and suggesting an unexpected
complexity of the political system by that time. Meanwhile, investigations at an elite residential
group north of the Great Plaza uncovered important burials dated to the middle to late 6th
century, indicating that the complexity of the political system extended throughout the elite
levels.

[243] Scales of Temporality and Social Complexity: Middle Woodland Hunter-Gatherer
      Societies of the Interior Middle Atlantic
Middle Woodland period mortuary complexes of the interior Middle Atlantic, evidencing restricted
internment and controlled exchange, have been interpreted as short-lived expressions of societal
ranking derived from a more settled, horticultural subsistence. Extremely limited archaeological
evidence for Middle Woodland stratification, coupled with the attenuation of the bluff-top stone
and earthen burial mound tradition at 1850 BP, has led to alternate hypotheses that explain the
meaning of these features. In particular, GIS analysis of mound locations, coupled with complex
hunter gatherer theory, points to Middle Woodland mounds as cyclical aggregation points
organized around lineages engaged in large-scale harvesting and feasting events.

Identity formation has been central to an archaeology in which material difference is more than
just random variation or the product of selection. Individuals who vary by class, status, gender,
race, and ethnicity actively construct the material world to create, reproduce, and transform
their social relations. In the 18th-century the identities of French settlers and their Native allies
were fluid, situational, and malleable. The social, political, and economic circumstances of the
fur trade and colonialism influenced identity formation and had material consequences that are
being investigated archaeologically at Fort St. Joseph, a frontier outpost in the western Great

The Moche and Chimu polities were ancient states. They were characterized by large

Archaeological survey in the Central Amazon allowed the identification of almost 100 sites in a

majority of the sites are multi-componential. Sites stratigraphies indicate that high-growth
vegetation did not developed on these places after final abandonment. Redundancy in
occupation created a landscape mosaic of smaller islands of occupied areas or fallow
surrounded by larger areas of high-growth forest. Such historical process led to the constitution
of places with symbolic and material meanings.

Historical texts testify to the flow of contraband, and the potential for archaeology to supplement

[55] Social Complexity during the Neolithic and Anthropology of Everydayness
The archaeological data on the Neolithic in Eurasia allow to define a variety of models of social
practices in multi-scale regional context. We will attempt to focus on the interpretation of the
archaeological data in terms of diverse social strategies for cultural reproduction including
evidence about the settlement pattern, cemeteries and contacts between close and distant
communities. In the focus of our case study are the Balkans during the later 7th and 6th millennia
cal. BCE and the interrelations between social complexity, hierarchy, solidarity and enculturation.
We will propose theoretical models to be tested against other regions of Eurasia.

[183] Technological Advancements: Seismic Refraction on the Pajarito Plateau
Geophysics provides techniques that can be used for non-invasive surveys at archaeological
sites. Seismic refraction is one such technology that has many potential applications, although it
has been underutilized. It is an inexpensive, efficient way to characterize subsurface deposits,
especially at sites in shallow contexts over bedrock. Archaeologists and geophysicists
participating in the Summer of Applied Geophysics Experience (SAGE), and from Los Alamos
National Laboratory and Bandelier National Monument are working together to characterize
Ancestral Pueblo (AD 1200 to 1600) sites. We present the results from three seismic refraction

      Applications of GIS in Archaeology
Our understanding of the processes that shaped the Tarascan state is inadequate and little is
known of the polities from which that state formed. This presentation analyzes how changes in
the water levels of Lake Patzcuaro affected the availability of local resources such as irrigated
and rain-fed farmlands. The stress created by these changes drastically affected tribute flows
and increased competition for resources among local elites. This, in turn, may have directly
contributed to the expansion of some polities within the basin and the eventual unification of the
region under a central elite in Tzintzuntzan.

Settlement pattern studies in Mesoamerica tend to rely heavily on spatial referents for

challenges this assumption by exposing some of the variability in political and economic ties
between primary centers and their presumed subordinates. This paper compares chronological
data from La Sierra, the Late Classic capital, and Palmarejo, the second largest site in the

As cultural resource management forced archaeologists to manage resources and determine

witnessed a literal explosion of methodological advances in extracting information from surface-
and plowzone-artifact signatures, with less emphasis placed on the behavioral significance of
those signatures. In a symposium devoted to behavioral inference based on surface and
plowzone materials, it is perhaps instructive to revisit that earlier period in order to provide a

Recent theorising about the processes of colonisation has produced a more complex view of
past interactions with a new focus at the level of the individual, a perspective that is particularly
amenable to bioarchaeological investigation. Biological, historical and material culture data
combine to form a basis for inference about population mobility and social interactions at the
end of the first millennium AD between groups that were drawn from widely separated areas of
origin: Ireland and Scandinavia. Differing cultural responses to biological hybridisation suggest
that identity was not determined solely by genealogical descent but also by pragmatic social

[13] Between Labor and Leisure:Tourism and Social Relations in 19th and Early 20th Century
     America
Leisure is often conceptualized as freedom from labor. This understanding sets up a dichotomy
between work (as production) and leisure (as consumption). We question this definition of
leisure and examine the dialectic between work and leisure. The roots of leisure lie with the
upper class; its extension to other classes is problematic. Its confinement to the realm of
consumption is also misguided within non-elite contexts. Leisure is productive of class, ethnic
and gender solidarity and creative of meaningful places. These points are given depth through
examples of the development of tourism in America in the 19th and early 20th centuries.

[84] Roads, Sites and Territories: A Pilot Study on Pre-Columbian Landscape Use in Puerto
     Rico
Archaeological and geographic data sets from southern Puerto Rico were combined to examine
whether there were any correlations between Pre-Columbian site locations and traditional roads.
The results suggest that there is a positive correlation between these two variables and that
ancient communication lines may be more clearly defined by conducting such an exercise. As a
result, the territorial expansion and/or interaction sphere of some communities could therefore be
partially reconstructed and later tested with excavation and 14C dating. The research
demonstrates that non-intrusive analysis of topographical and archaeological features may hold
promise for examining changes in settlement patterns through time.

The USDA Forest Service has hosted the Passport in Time (PIT) program for 17 years,
engaging the public in historic preservation projects on national forests nation-wide.
Beginning in 2006, we would like to invite other agencies to participate. Volunteers can help
with every aspect of historic preservation, from the mundane to the exciting. They learn and
have fun while helping accomplish preservation goals from survey to evaluation to curation.
Perhaps most importantly, they become advocates for historic preservation. It is time to
broaden the volunteers' dedication and expertise beyond Forest Service boundaries to
historic properties and on all public lands.

[4] Differential Use of Ritual Space at the Temple of Choque Ispana on the Coast of Peru
The temple of Choque Ispana sits at the mouth of the Huaura valley on the central coast of Peru.
The temple was burned by the Spanish in 1650 in the anti-idolatry movement and was later
impacted by bulldozers in the 20th century. Still, the density of surface scatters indicates great
potential for archaeological investigation. Preliminary survey has displayed marked differences in
the use of space throughout the temple complex, including the presence of varied activity areas
within the temple, and a clear distinction between the types of activities conducted in the interior
and exterior of the temple.

[211] Social Configurations and the Study of Archaeological Funerary Theory
The Archaeology of Death conference was a landmark in the development of theory in
archaeology. In both the spread of archaeological cases and the range of historical,
anthropological, and biological data considered, it seemed that at least in funerary studies
archaeology had succeeded in developing a stable body of theory on which future substantive
research could be based. Now, some 27 years after the conference, it is appropriate to consider
how the archaeological theory of funerary practices has fared and to assess the degree to
which its early promise has been realized.

[70] "...and the cotton was very well spun:" An Examination of Three Caribbean ("Taino")
     Cotton Artefacts
Cotton - both in its raw state and as finished product - was one of the main commodities of trade
within the Pre-Hispanic Caribbean. Cotton was ubiquitous - woven into objects of utility, wealth
(e.g., belts) and, ultimately, veneration (cemis). Only a few cotton artefacts survive today in
museum collections. Ongoing research on three of these important artefacts - two cemis and a
beaded belt -offer new insights into Taino resource utilisation, weaving technologies and stylistic
changes over time.

[216] The Material Culture of the Basin of Mexico: Continuity and Change AD 1400-AD 1620
The Spanish conquest of Tenochtitlan and the surrounding Basin of Mexico (1519-1521)
traumatized the prehispanic cultures and realigned or replaced religious ideologies, political
organization, and economic systems. Further transformations included the integration of those
cultures into the bottom rungs of a Spanish Empire spanning the globe. However, archaeological
studies of rural sites indicate substantial continuity in many aspects of material culture and less
dramatic, more subtle changes. Comparable studies in Mexico-Tenochtitlan indicate earlier and
greater changes in material culture. Continuity and change in figurine, ceramic, spinning, and
obsidian industries will be presented.

[41] How War Began: The Derivation of Two Paths to War
Warfare developed along two paths. Early hunters of large game engaged in combat using
ambushes and lines. Peaceful agriculturalists in the Old and New Worlds, after they created
states, engaged in battles and siege operations. The first path was derived deductively by
combining such elements as hominid behavioral responses, lethal weapons use, and male-
centered power groups. The second path was derived inductively by fitting archaeological
sequences from four regions to a set of stages. Empirically it was found that despotic states
preceded the development of warfare. The focus of the presentation will be upon the two types of
derivations.

Seeing the Forest for the Trees: Information Management and Its Role in Historic Preservation
The fields of archaeology and historic preservation are, by nature, very data-intensive.
Professionals at government agencies, State Historic Preservation Offices, contracting firms, and

historic resources. While typical databases are designed and built for specific needs at a specific
point in the historic preservation process, we submit that a more strategic vision is required to
move cultural resource management from a reactive to a proactive approach.

[113] Ritual Paraphernalia and the Foundation of Religious Temples: The Case of the Tairona-
      Kogui, Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Colombia
Recent radiocarbon dating of artifacts collected by K. T. Preuss in 1915 confirm the association
in time with the proposed sequence of temple foundations of the Kogui, an ethnic group of the
Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The antiquity of the temple foundations can be deduced from the
geneaology of the priests in charge documented by Preuss. Ritual paraphernalia, like masks,
which have obviously been created commemorating the foundation of a temple give us a hint in
terms of modeling the bases of power and the development of monumental architecture. The
antiquity of the masks still in use by the Kogui gives us the opportunity to connect the pre-
Columbian to the actual iconography of ritual paraphernalia and by consequence try to explain
and test the foundation of temples, the uses of paraphernalia by priestly organizations, and
changes and continuities since pre-Columbian times.

Following the premise that political economies are rooted in local traditions, research was
focused at understanding social and political dynamics of a hinterland settlement that potentially
maintained ties with nearby centers such as Blue Creek and Gran Cacao. Findings reveal
patterns of household practices and growth, and provide information for the Terminal Classic and
Early Postclassic in terms of extended occupation histories and what may have been an unstable
social climate.

Fifteen soil samples extracted from seven lithic artefacts of the archaeological sites "Cueva de

for starch grain content. In order to formulate the first hypotheses about tuberous and seed
plants use and their importance in the economical and political configuration of the Utuado
archaeological area, we correlated the obtained archaeobotanical data with the synchronic/
diachronic contexts of the studied sites. The preliminary data suggest that there were important
endogenous plants that played a major role in the economical botany of the area, while other
"higher yield" exogenous plants were produced and used, but apparently in a minor scale. The
obtained information reveals that the phyto-cultural dynamics in central Puerto Rico are different

Phosphorous analysis is a popular chemical technique in archaeology and in this study we
applied the Mehlich-2 method to infer shifts in the aboriginal use of Site CA-LAn-62, Los
Angeles, California. To this end, we collected sediment from 36 profiles at 2-cm intervals and
measured the phosphorous (PO4) content of 800 samples, which had PO4 concentrations of 10-
--–570 mg kg-1 (ppm). Fluctuations in PO4 content correlated closely with stone artifact and
faunal material density across four strata, representing site occupations between 4590 BC and ~
AD 1700. We discuss these results in relation to occupational intensity and regional chronology.

The Lacandon Maya of the lowland rainforests of Peten, Guatemala, and Chiapas, Mexico,
were affected by colonialism in different ways beginning in the Colonial Period until the
twentieth century. At first the contact with outsiders was intermittent, then during the nineteenth
century interaction increased following the migration of loggers, settlers, and priests into the
lowlands. Trade was always important for the Lacandon, however, Western goods became
greater necessities during the later Republican Period. The Lacandon were politically
decentralized following the Spanish conquest, but some men achieved higher status and
political power from their roles in the expanding trade.

researchers with various expertise directly in field excavations, among them specialists studying
human remains. Among the first such skeletal biologists, Buikstra coined the term
bioarchaeology to reflect the new questions being posed about the past, and novel analytical
approaches engaged to answer them. I discuss the impact bioarchaeology has had on our
understanding of past human groups, and the influence of this approach through Buikstra‘s work

was regularly and exclusively located in plazas. It will be suggested that this association is linked
to techniques of power and discipline critical to the functioning of the Chen Chen export

examining the variation within such an assemblage, a group‘s social and hierarchical
organization can be better understood. Using this methodology, a sample of the textile-
impressed ceramics from the Caborn-Welborn Phase of the Slack Farm site in Kentucky was
analyzed.

[211] Funerary Symbolism and Monumentality: Big Questions for Later Prehistory
Chapman and Randsborg's introduction to The Archaeology of Death raised the spectre of
funerary practices as potential misrepresentations of social relations, a theme subsequently
elaborated on by archaeologists and anthropologists. Funerary rituals are just one of many forms
of social expression, and deducing social organisation from mortuary evidence alone is
problematic. Since The Archaeology of Death, such theoretical challenges have been
accompanied by scientific advances and new questions, particularly about our species' material
construction of death and the afterlife from 10,000 BC onwards. How have funerary elaboration
and monumentality contributed to social transformations from Neolithic to nuclear humanity?

findings differ from what would be expected if consumption varied according to closeness to the
monumental core. This study expands upon the previous research by including two previously
unanalyzed sites, Los Pilarillos and El Potrerito, in order to further evaluate the expectation that
high-status foods would be consumed more at La Quemada because of its social and political

[29] Cave Oracles
 Oracles figured significantly in the religious and political life of Mesoamerica. Polities consulted
oracles at regional pilgrimage sites for prophesies regarding rulership and war. Individuals often
sought oracles for pronouncements regarding healing or medicine. Research documents an
intimate association between oracles and natural features such as caves and cenotes in
Mesoamerica. Pilgrimage centers frequently housed oracles adjacent to prominent landmarks
and oracular insights were often attributed to the power of such features. As portals to the
supernatural and residences of specific deities, caves and cenotes occupied an important
role in the construction and legitimization of oracles.

[186] Power and Identity Personified: The Case of the Mississippian Ridge-Top Mounds
Spotty details from several of the dozen known ridge-top mortuary mounds of greater
Cahokia suggest that theatrical termination and inauguration rites of ruling families
involved an imagined legendary history, a re-invented creation story, and redefined
notions of personhood and corporate identity. Subsequent Mississippian identities were
personifications of supernatural forces contingent on these earlier political-cultural
movements of power/ identity theater. Hence definitions of individuals, social persons,

[171] Native American Resistance and the Slaughter of Livestock: Domesticated Animals as

Efforts by colonial entities to effect change in indigenous societies were met by active and
passive resistance. Cross-culturally, livestock play important symbolic roles in active resistance

to European and Euro-American colonization efforts. Among the southeastern Creeks, and the
southwestern O‘odham, livestock (even animals owned by Native Americans) were slaughtered
in resistance to efforts aimed at altering indigenous lifeways. The Creeks specifically targeted
livestock as a symbol of the American ―civilization‖ program (Braund 1993:187). The role of
livestock in active, and oftentimes violent, resistance to colonialism indicates that domesticated
animals were important as symbolic entities above and beyond economy and subsistence.

[100] Prehistoric Personal Gear: Analysis of a Complete Toolkit of a Highly Mobile Hunter-
       Gatherer
We present the findings of a detailed analysis of flaked stone tools from a highly mobile hunter-
gatherer toolkit. Recovered from a high elevation artifact cache in the North Central Sierra
Nevada, California, the find undoubtedly represents the complete stone toolkit of an individual,
consisting of over 30 formed tools and usable flakes, manufactured from a uniform raw
material, and of similar size and dimension. The geographic location of the cache combined
with its isolation from other cultural material represents a unique archaeological occurrence
affording an opportunity to contrast competing theoretical models of hunter-gatherer mobility
and toolkit configuration against empirical evidence.

Freshwater mussel ranges have been greatly altered by erosion, pollution, damming and

can be used to establish baseline data useful for conservation and habitat restoration. A
study funded by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service via the Mississippi Department of
Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks is underway in Mississippi, the goal of which is to analyze
archaeological shell remains from across the state. Data from the Tombigbee, Mississippi,

[241] Turtles from Turtle Island: An Archaeological Perspective from Iroquoia
Iroquoians believe their world, Turtle Island, was created on the back of the mythological Turtle.
Archaeologically, there is abundant evidence throughout Iroquoia that Turtle was highly
symbolic. Complete turtles were modified into rattles but turtle shells and bones were also
utilized in a variety of symbolic ways and Turtle was graphically depicted in several media. This
paper explores the symbolic treatments and uses of Turtle in eastern North America which date
back to the Archaic period and evolved into the mythologies of linguistically and culturally diverse
groups including the Iroquoians, Algonkians (Anishinaabeg) and Sioux.

Excellent preservation and systematic recovery of biological remains from a large pit at the
Pechichal site provide insights into vegetational clearance. Microvertebrates, animals whose live
weights do not exceed 1 kg, are important for paleoecological inferences, as their narrow niche
requirements and restricted ranges make them sensitive to local habitats. Phytoliths deposited in
alluvial settings record regional vegetation and in situ plant deposition. Charred macroremains
document deliberate or accidental exposure of plant tissues to fire. Integration of these data
permits identification of vegetational clearance and subsistence activities, and reveals that the pit

[50] From Genocide to Ecocide: The Rape of Rapa Nui
The theory of Easter Island's "ecological suicide" has become a popular notion. According to this
premise, the indigenous population destroyed their forest and drove their animals to extinction.
As a result, its society collapsed, descending into civil war, cannibalism and self-destruction.
While the theory of "ecocide" has become almost paradigmatic, a dark secret hangs over the
premise of Easter Island's self-destruction: an actual genocide terminated Rapa Nui's indigenous
populace and its culture. This paper describes the foundations of the theory of "ecocide" and
explains why it does not hold up to scientific scrutiny.

The majority of archaeological models that postulate demic diffusion of the Neolithic locate the

based on an approach akin to cladistic analysis leads me to suggest, to the contrary, that two
distinct processes were involved. One would have led from the Levant to Greece through coastal
routes, while a later one would have led from Anatolia to Bulgaria through inland routes. This
new model not only has archaeological implications, but also direct linguistic and genetic

and power that influence interpretation of these data are explored, with particular attention to the
paradoxical task of women laboring in the present to explain the labor of women in the past.

indicate that a combination of microfossil analyses, both starches and phytoliths, will be key
in gaining an understanding of ancient plant use and migration in this region.

A settled agricultural way of life was firmly established in the middle reaches of the Yellow River

scattered settlements of a few relatively undifferentiated households. By 5000 BCE, these
communities had become substantially larger, more numerous, and more densely populated.
The regional distribution, spatial organization, and artifactual assemblages of these Early
Yangshao villages suggest an increased intensity of inter-household and inter-settlement
interaction, and a fundamental reorganization of previous social and economic structures—
changes that presage the later development of social hierarchies in the region.

Experimental flint tools were used to process edible wild plants typical of high latitude
environments. Examination of these tools using reflected light microscopy (100-500x) provides a
catalogue for more specific identification of plant residues in general, and helps elucidate the role
of plants in Neanderthal subsistence.

[58] On Women and Academic Archaeology
My stints as an anthropology undergraduate and an archaeology graduate student were
positive and unremarkable in terms of gender issues. At some point, I internalized the belief
that academia is an inherently welcoming place for women archaeologists, and I assumed that
the hardest part of an academic career would be simply getting a job. My maiden voyage as
an assistant professor at a small college revealed some problems with my belief system. I
want to share my experiences with my colleagues, and I want to see gender-challenged
anthropology programs evolve to become more like my current nurturing one.

[237] PAPAC and the Study of Copan´s Urban Renovation under Yax Pasaj
Excavations at Group 11K-6, El Bosque, were designed to evaluate the authors' independently-

Pasaj responded to the instability of the late eighth century with a city-wide program of massive
architectural and cosmological renewal. This centrally-directed endeavor entailed re-establishing
the ritual boundaries by renovating critical architectural nodes. These data challenge notions of
Copan as ceremonial center and argue for the protection and conservation beyond the Principal

[195] The Origins of Prestige Goods as Costly (Honest) Signals of Skill and Knowledge
The correlation between prestige goods and other indicators of sociopolitical hierarchy is
typically assumed to be due to admiration and desire for such goods, as is commonly
experienced by people in contemporary societies. Yet this desire in itself requires explanation,
given that prestige goods appear, at different times and places, fairly late in prehistory.
Following Henrich and Gil-White‘s ―information goods‖ theory, I suggest that prestige goods
initially evolved to function as honest signals of skill and expertise, and that the psychological
mechanisms underlying this function link them to later roles in signaling leadership qualities,
social status ranking, and group strength.

    the Southeastern U.S.
Kolomoki is the earliest site in the Southeast with good evidence for a large, sedentary village.
In his work at the site, Sears presented a dichotomy between ―sacred‖ and ―secular‖ ceramic
assemblages, a distinction he used to support the notion of a stratified form of social
organization. While Sears‘s interpretation of social stratification at Kolomoki is questionable, the
recognition of a tension between sacred and secular spheres is useful. It was this opposition
between public and private arenas for social action that allowed for the growth of the village at
Kolomoki and the development of more pronounced—albeit situational—positions of authority.

The late Pliocene of Africa is notable for the appearance of the earliest archaeological traces

confers value to stone for the people who make, trade, use, and even study stone implements?,"
we demonstrate how value informs the study of stone tools.

carnivore consumption of meatier hindlimbs and axial parts. Hindlimbs are heavily ravaged or

[126] From Cacibajagua to Chicomoztoc: The Cave Art Connection
Archaeologists acknowledge no significant material evidence of interaction between the Classic
and Postclassic civilizations of mainland Mesoamerica and the contemporary cultures from the
Greater Antilles. Similarities in cave art and cave use, however, suggest a significant shared and
persistent cognitive and aesthetic connection. This paper addresses the mytho-historic,
ceremonial, and aesthetic similarities between cave art --specifically, modified speleothems--
from the Greater Antilles and mainland Mesoamerica.

[205] Staves, Stones, Trees, and Pillars in the Pre-Columbian World
Throughout the Ancient New World and to recent times, tall stones and wooden shafts have held
special symbolic roles. At Chavin de Huantar, the Staff God stands with staves while the Great
God, inside the temple, is in the shape of a lancehead. Among the Maya, tall stones—stelae—
were elaborately decorated with the portraits and deeds of lords. In Costa Rica, tall stones mark
graves in Chiriqui cemeteries. Some years ago, Donald Lathrap suggested that such monuments
were symbolic World Trees, cycling cosmic power. This paper examines this concept and these
objects and seeks to see other connections and relations between them.

[133] Stone Tool Drilling Technology and Retouch Intensity: A Neolithic Case Study
Measuring retouch on stone tools can only be accomplished by considering the influence of
manufacturing processes, curation cycles, and overall tool use life. This paper explores retouch
patterns on a lithic assemblage of perforating tools associated with ground stone bead
production from Dhra`, Jordan, a Neolithic site occupied 11,500 years ago. Stone tool
manufacture and curation practices are identified using experimentally replicated data. These
data are used to help build techniques to measure retouch amount and intensity on the
archaeological assemblage while gaining insight into bead production and the organization of
technologies during the forager to farmer transition.

Unlike historic-period archaeologists, those working in prehistoric time periods are assumed to
proceed without the aid of historic texts. While some draw from the earliest texts to extrapolate
ancient ways of life or to develop a history for unrecorded times, nearly all prehistoric
archaeologists utilize the writings of the antiquarian explorers and pioneering archaeologists in
their work. This paper will explore the influence of these early writings on later research trends
in prehistoric archaeology with special focus on the early British explorers in India.

[19] The Spread of Agriculture in the Netherlands: A Singularity?
In general terms, the spread of agriculture in Europe seems to have occurred in a series of
waves. The Netherlands provide a well-documented case study which may serve as a cautionary
tale for the general validity of this model. Around 1990 the evidence fitted well in the general
model for northern Europe. It suggested a full-scale adoption of farming around 4000 cal. BC.
New research makes clear that in the fifth millennium BC a society developed best described as
hunter-gatherer-farmers. The presentation is a plea for the study of regional prehistories as
opposed to high-level generalizations.

[242] From Dispersed to Nucleated Settlement Patterns in Northeast Mississippi
In the Ohio valley, Woodland sedentary settlement patterns changed from dispersed to
nucleated and earthworks were abandoned. In northeast Mississippi from 200 BC to AD 200, a
dispersed pattern, associated with vacant ceremonial centers such as Ingomar Mounds, was
present. Ceramic seriation of survey assemblages shows that small occupations became fewer
through time and space, from the Black Prairie on the east to the North Central Hills on the west.
A concomitant increase in nucleated occupations (larger than 3 ha) was accompanied by
earthwork disuse. Nucleation proved unsustainable and abandonment followed.

gained wealth and high office, despite being a Presbyterian; exploratory excavations at his

his probate inventory does not include credit to others. Did he operate on a ―cash‖ basis because

[129] Agricultural Production in the Jemez Mountains: From Coalition through Early Historic
Agriculture is a risky strategy in the Southwest. In the Jemez Mountains, archaeological
evidence, including field houses and field improvement features in upland settings, began to

and intensification continued even after much of the remainder of the Pueblo world had
relocated to lowland riparian areas in the late 1400s. Recent survey has documented
improved gardens and field houses at elevations greater than 2470 meters (8100 feet) as part
of a diverse system of mesa-top and canyon-slope fields, indicating maximized production in

[54] Selective Memory During the Late Archaic in East-Central Florida
The emergence of ceramic traditions during the Late Archaic along the middle St. Johns River
in Florida is characterized by a dichotomy between the cessation of monumental shell mound
construction and continuity in traditional subsistence practices. Although not mound builders,
local pottery producing communities invoked the past by situating some villages adjacent to
Preceramic mounds, performing commemorative practices at others, and avoiding many more.
This study uses recent investigations along the middle St. Johns to explore the ways that
agents selectively used the past to make new traditions, personnel, and social arrangements
meaningful in the context of continued daily practices.

mobile groups practicing swidden cultivation use chipped stone tools made on flakes struck from
unprepared cores. Grinding and pounding tools are made on selected cobbles and modified
primarily by use. The establishment of large sedentary agricultural populations at the end of the
3rd millennium BP marks the beginning of craft specialization in chipped, ground and polished
stone industries.

Ideas of labor and leisure pervade virtually every aspect of social experience. How we (and our
subjects) define the concepts of labor and leisure shapes understandings of class, identity, and
the capitalist system. And as archaeologists we deploy these concepts in our typologies of
objects, spaces, and practices. Given that we, as researchers, carry with us very particular

these concepts in our work is critical. This paper poses a series of broad questions regarding
theories of labor and leisure as they intersect with some of the old chestnuts of sociological and

[213] Why Shell Temper? Cooking Technology or Meaningful Metaphor?
For years efforts have been made to explain the spread of the manufacture of shell-tempered

focused on demonstrating, by experiment, the mechanical superiority of shell-tempered vessels
for cooking, in particular for boiling corn. Almost no positive results have been produced by this
experimental archaeology. Therefore, another hypothesis is advanced to explain why
Mississippian Societies adopted shell-tempered pottery. This hypothesis draws on symbolic and
cultural factors in the Mississippianization process. Empirical data will be cited in support of this
hypothesis, in addition to inferential reasoning.

[49] The Metropolitan Maya
Many scholars agree that urbanism is a key feature in city-states. But generally, urbanism is not
a trait associated with pre-industrial societies. Therefore, how and why city-states formed in
predominantly agrarian societies continues to be especially vexing. This is particularly true when
discussing issues of complexity among the Classic Maya, where the concept of an urbanized
cityscape is highly contested. To address these issues, I explore the process of urbanization in
the political landscape of the north-central Peten between AD 150 and 400. I conclude that not
only was urbanization present, but it was a prerequisite for the development of the Maya city-
state.

Some archaeologists argue that mounds composed primarily of shell and fish bone are funerary

consequence of accumulated food remains between AD 300 and 1500. Vertebrate and
invertebrate remains from these three coastal sites contain similar suites of estuarine animals,
most of which do not conform to proposed criteria defining ritual, sacred, or unusual foods.
Instead, these materials contain evidence for economic adaptations to environmental changes

subsistence. Here 167 Peruvian skeletons from six sites, possessing well-defined subsistence
patterns were analyzed using discriminant analysis. Results indicate that fishing and farming
populations are distinguishable for 78% of individuals. Test cases fitted to the model where mode
of subsistence was less certain provide valuable insights into possible mixed subsistence
practices.

structures and river bed, and among various structures. Possible explanations include natural
river bed variation through time and cultural selection of material. Approximately 50 of the
boulders in structures are calcareous sandstones obtained outside the river basin: initial
petrologic sampling has not identified a nearby source.

[169] Political-economic Change and Landscape Transformations in Senegambia during the
      Atlantic Era: A Preliminary View from the Siin (Senegal)
The Atlantic era marks a turbulent period in the history of Senegambia, defined by dramatic
transformations in local socio-economic conditions. Historical understanding of these "global
encounters" often derives from the better documented polities that were closely involved with
European commerce. While generally less tractable, the historical past of more modest
participants nevertheless offers alternative perspectives into Atlantic exchanges. The small
coastal kingdom of Siin (Senegal) has been the focus of recent archaeological work aimed at
examining long-term change in regional political-economy. Combining multiple sources, research
in Siin provides preliminary insights on the impact of global forces on Senegambian social
landscapes.

[148] Representing Maya Architecture: Techniques for Research and Education
Educators, professionals, and other scholars use many, varied media to portray Maya
Architecture. Traditional methods of representation typically include text, drawings, and
photographs, which serve as efficient teaching tools; however, they often deprive students and
researchers of a sense of space. Static, sculpted 3D models provide a sense of mass and
space, yet create a top-down, external perspective that lacks a sense of place. Virtual 3D
models, in contrast, facilitate experiential learning via virtual exploration and alternative
perspectives. These multi-media integrated within an internet-based database of the
architecture of the Ancient Americas serve as an invaluable tool for research and education.

[35] Viewing the Ruins: The Early Documentary History of Aztalan
This paper reviews the early narrative accounts of the discovery of the Aztalan site in southeast
Wisconsin. First person accounts of Midwestern archaeological sites that describe a site‘s
condition prior to historic and modern disturbances are rare. Yet when available, these narratives
are useful as indicators of the pre-settlement integrity of site features and deposits. Moreover,
early reports can sometimes help to connect the initial site discovery process with current
archaeological problems as well as emerging discourse on the role of the public in
archaeological inquiry.

[132] Radiocarbon Dating and Dietary Stable Isotope Analysis of Kwaday Dän Ts‟inchí
We present the results of AMS radiocarbon dating and isotopic analysis of the frozen human
remains named Kwaday Dän Ts‘inchí recovered from a high elevation glacier in Northwest
British Columbia, Canada in 1999. The isotopic analysis indicated that Kwaday Dän Ts‘inchí had
a strongly marine diet, which was unexpected due to the find location; however, hair and bone
cholesterol isotopic values showed a dietary shift to terrestrial foods in the year before death.
The dating evidence was not straightforward, but we conclude that Kwaday Dän Ts‘inchi dates to
between 1670 and 1850 cal. AD.

[211] And Gave Them for the Potter's Field
This paper argues that the materials recovered from the Milwaukee County Poor Farm Cemetery
cannot be viewed as a homogenous analytical unit. The conflict inherent in a public policy
intended to provide a decent burial while simultaneously discouraging utilization of the service
can only be understood within the larger context of poorhouse operation in the U.S. during the
late nineteenth and early twentieth century. This study argues that meaningful interpretation of
this cemetery must be conducted with reference to two separate but related perspectives: the
role of human agency and the role of prevailing social structures within which such cemeteries
operated.

Excavations during 2004 on the SW edge of the agrestic center of El Coyote in the lower

[53] The Missing Link: Drowned Preceramic Sites on the Peruvian Continental Shelf
There has been little speculation on the significance of drowned preceramic sites on the
Peruvian continental shelf to our understanding of cultural development on the coast prior to
5,000 BP. The future discovery of drowned Early and Middle Preceramic sites may well hold the
key to the intensity of early maritime adaptations and the rise of Later Preceramic temple
centers. Temple centers appear to "burst" upon the landscape with little evidence for the
developments that led up to the formation of these monumental sites. Underwater research is
the key to answering this question.

[113] Natural Sources of Power and Emerging Authority at Chavin de Huantar
Natural elements were regarded as sources of sacred power throughout Andean prehistory,
and proximity to such elements has often been used to explain Andean monumental centers.
Recent Andean history demonstrates that such natural elements are not simply symbolically
potent, but also powerful-and threatening-in very concrete ways. In the case of the Formative
monumental center of Chavin de Huantar, local environmental elements, and the risks they
entail, suggest that emergent elites drew upon the power inherent in the landscape as a source
of religious authority. The pattern of construction and the engineering strategies of the site
suggest conscious mobilization of environmental sources of power.

Despite being frequently mentioned in the debates concerning the Middle-Upper Paleolithic
transition, the Uluzzian remains a poorly understood technocomplex. This paper presents a
discussion of new dates for the Uluzzian in order to position it chronologically in relation to other
contemporary Eurasian technocomplexes. These data are complemented with behavioral
information derived from detailed lithic analysis of three geographical clusters of Uluzzian
assemblages, in order to highlight both its internal variability and its technologically defining
traits. This dual reassessment permits a critical discussion of the Uluzzian‘s place in debates
about modern human origins in western Eurasia as a whole.

X-ray florescence analysis was used to assess the provenance of manufacture of ceramic
vessels recovered from the Early and Late Woodland occupations at the multi-component
Pethick site in Schoharie County, New York. The compositional profiles of ceramic vessels were
recorded and compared with the profiles of known clays in the valley. The results of this project
suggest that the vessels from this site form several different clay groups with most vessels
manufactured from local clays. Some non-locally manufactured pots were also identified and
may represent interaction with neighboring groups.

[82] Taphonomy and Funerary Practice in Collective Cemeteries. A Prehistoric Case from
     Menorca (Balearic Islands, Spain)
Taphonomic issues are a major aspect of archaeological research when dealing with collective
burials. Usually the lack of any apparent order or organization among disarticulated human
remains is interpreted in terms of secondary depositions (ossarium). However, the explanation
might not be that simple since taphonomic changes of a very varied nature (i.e., body decay,
animal activity, atmospheric conditions, ritual practices) are responsible for the formation of the
archaeological record. A case study from a prehistoric Spanish cemetery (1450-800 BC) is
presented here as an illustration of the kind of questions that need to be approached.

This paper surveys the process of urbanization in the northern Maya area from Late
Preclassic precursors to the close of the Classic period. We attempt to sort out
patterning at several levels of analysis: forms of elite and non-elite domestic
architecture, the distribution of organizational features (causeways, plazas), and types
of architectural groupings. We also gather information on smaller communities to
assess which traits, if any, are peculiar to large centers, which are regionally specific,
and which are shared with cites elsewhere in the Maya area. We also assess the
implications of these data for political organization and demography.

Red abalone middens, a California Channel Islands site type with a high proportion of red
abalone shells, contain valuable information on human subsistence and environmental change.
These deposits are often preceded, and followed, by mussel, black abalone, and sea urchin
strata. Researchers have debated whether this shift in species abundance is the product of
environmental change, human overpredation, or a combination of variables. Isotopic analysis of
California mussel and red abalone shells from several sites suggests that environmental change
had limited effects on abalone location and indicates that people probably dove for most of the

[70] Archaeoastronomy at the Caguana Ceremonial Center, Utuado, Puerto Rico
During 1915, while working for the New York Academy of Science, Franz Boas visited the
island of Puerto Rico with a group of anthropologists. Their aim was to study the history and
prehistory of the island. A large archaeological site drew their attention and as a result, Alden
J. Mason and Robert T. Atken surveyed the site. The site was called Capá because it was
covered with trees of capá prieto (Cordia alliodora). Alden Mason found 13 plazas or
ballcourts and completed an archaeological study of this site. Twelve of these structures are
square or rectangular in shape. One is circular. The Caguana site has been dated between
1200 to 1500 BC and the ceramic work associated to it belongs to the Taino culture, and is
located in the municipality of Utuado in the central mountain region of Puerto Rico. The
compass bearings, magnetic declination and the slope of the horizon of all the plazas were
used to find significant alignments with astronomical events. Results indicate that the plazas
are aligned toward relevant astronomical events during certain dates of the year.

[123] Taíno Romanticism: Toward a Genealogy of the Representation of the
       "Indigenous" in 19th and 20th Century Puerto Rican Letters
The noble ―Taíno‖ emerged in Puerto Rican archaeological and ethnohistorical discourse during
the 19th century. Its initial formulations can be traced to the work of nationalist Creole
intellectuals who used native symbols to create a sense of national identity in contradistinction to
colonial power. This narrative (idealized bucolic ―Taíno‖ or defiant, brave anti-colonial warrior)
became common in Puerto Rican literature. I will examine these figures in the key writers of the
epoch such as Ramón Emeterio Betances, Eugenio María de Hostos, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera,
Daniel Rivera, Cayetano Coll y Toste, and Juan Antonio Corretjer.

[80] El Uso de Troncocónicas Formativas Como Graneros: Un Acercamiento Experimental
Se afirma que la función primaria de los pozos troncocónicos del Formativo mesoamericano
fue almacenar grano. Evaluamos su utilidad para tal propósito guardando maíz en réplicas
equipadas con termómetros e higrómetros con registradores. El subsuelo endurecido y la
reducida boca resultan efectivos para aislar el contenido de cambios bruscos en las
condiciones meteorológicas y protegerlo de roedores, pero la conservación del grano se
dificulta por la alta temperatura (ca. 20°C), la falta de ventilación, la humedad de las paredes
e insectos acarreados con la cosecha. El almacenamiento a corto plazo parece posible, pero
requeriría de otros ajustes tecnológicos.
The bell-shaped pits common in Formative Mesoamerica are claimed to have served to store
grain at the beginning of their use-lives. Their adequacy for this purpose is assessed in replicas
filled with maize and instrumented with data loggers recording temperature and humidity. The
indurated subsoil and constricted mouth prove effective for isolating the contents from sudden
changes in outside weather and protecting them from rodents, but the preservation of grain is
made difficult by elevated temperature (ca. 20°C), lack of ventilation, moist walls and insects
accidentally introduced with the crop. Short-term storage seems possible, but would require
other technological adjustments.

[161] Bateyes Revisited: Reconsidering their Socio-Political Role
Caribbean bateyes are frequently referred to as ceremonial and ritualistic in nature. This paper
explores the socio-political role of bateyes through the analysis of remnants of activity. The
results generated significant observations highlighting the variability between sites with bateyes.
At one of the sites, archaeological materials and features evidence activities associated to daily
chores occurring onsite, such as fishing, cooking, manufacturing of vessels, retouching and re-
working of tools. The data indicates that some batey enclosures were located within habitational
areas and had a more secular socio-political role. The study also demonstrates that impacted
sites should be targeted for study.

[1] Vertical and Horizontal Interactions in the Precolonial Caribbean
The Antilles have traditionally been perceived as a marginal space in the Circum-
Caribbean. However, a review of the evidence suggests the possibility of the existence
of interaction spheres between the inhabitants of the West Indies and those from
surrounding continental regions, particularly the Istmo-Colombian area and
Southeastern United States. This scant but important evidence is presented as it
illustrates the need of paying closer attention to the operation of such macroregional
interaction circuits, which could have been of much more importance in the vertical and
horizontal configuration of the cultures that emerged and developed in such areas than
previously suggested.

[84] Time: The Forgotten Variable in Caribbean Archaeology
Time has been the most overlooked and misused archaeological dimension in West Indian
archaeology. This is illustrated with a survey of more than 250 radiocarbon dates from
Puerto Rico which is used to revisit certain unresolved issues in the archaeology of the
island. These issues include the Archaic/Saladoid interface, the Huecoid problem, and the
spatial configuration of villages and communities in south-central Puerto Rico during the
Ceramic Age. The markedly different scenarios on these issues, to those originally
proposed resulting from the employment of finer scales of temporality, demonstrates the
urgency of paying closer attention to time in Caribbean archaeology.

[103] Sources of Lead-Glazed Pottery in Xaltocan, Mexico
Lead-glazed pottery was introduced in Mexico by Spanish colonizers. Slowly, indigenous potters
adopted glazing techniques and lead-glazed pottery made its way to rural markets, such as
Xaltocan, a site approximately 50km north of Mexico City. In this poster we use INAA data to
examine whether colonial lead-glazed pottery in Xaltocan comes from the same sources as
contemporaneous or pre-Columbian plain earthenwares, or whether lead-glazed and plain
pottery come from entirely different sources. The results have implications for the study of pottery
production, market exchange, and household integration to the wider economy.

[205] Jungle Religion: Enduring Mythemes and Mythic Substitution in Amazonian Cosmology
A lowland South Amerindian cosmological model (Roe 1982) envisioned a multi-layered
universe: Earth, Sky and Sub-Aquatic Underworlds, each level represented by dual apical
predators: Jaquar, Eagle, Caymanic Dragon. This animistic worldview emerged from a
hallucinogenic epistemology, its continuous life-death transformations emulating jungle ecology.
Morales' (1995) discovery of this ethos instantiated in triple-tiered Chavin Pacopampa, with the
same Terrible Trinity of animal icons on each level, dates it to the Formative, stretching from
Amazonian to Olmec Mesoamerica. One of that Nuclear American ethos' mythemes, the Sub-
aquatic Dragon, via its mythic substitution, 19th century garretas in Shipibo mythology, endures,
an archaeological Rosetta Stone.

[2] Fire and the Ancient Management of the Forestdale Landscape
The management and preservation of Southwestern uplands necessarily includes
consideration of the role of fire. Fire histories are becoming increasingly important tools
for determining the role of fire in landscape preservation. However, these fire histories
often emphasize "natural" fire regimes and neglect the influence of human residents.
Ancient management of fuels and fires on the landscape must also be considered. This
study employs an off-site geoarchaeological approach to identify if, when, and how
ancient and historic residents of the Forestdale Valley of the Fort Apache Indian
Reservation modified existing fire regimes and the ecological consequences of this
management.

[8] What Are Amazonian Shellmounds? Residential Middens or Ceremonial Monuments?
    Recent Research Suggests That They Are Both These and More
Amazonian river shellmounds have been interpreted differently over time. In prehistory, mounds
of older cultures served as foundations, building material, and ceramic temper. By the
eighteenth century, Amazonians mined mounds for road material, building material, and
whitewash. Late 19th century geologists thought the mounds natural deposits of index fossils
for chronologies, but soon realized they were middens of early ceramic fishing peoples.
Twentieth century archaeologists confirmed the middens but also found houses, cooking
facilities, and ceremonial deposits; geophysical survey and test-pitting revealed complex site
plans. In the 21st century wide-area excavations can reveal activity areas and structures.

[61] Cereal Exploitation in the Early Pre-Pottery Neolithic of the Southern Levant: A Phytolith
     Story of Foraging to Irrigation Farming
Archaeobotanists studying the origins of agriculture in the Levant disagree about when and
where the cultivation and domestication of cereals first took place. The debate is primarily based
on the macrobotanical remains of cereals in PPNA sites in this region. There remain questions
about the dating of the early cereals in some sites and whether these remains represent
deliberately planted or collected resources at others. The phytolith record from PPNA sites in the
Jordan Valley such as Netiv Hagdud, Dhra and Wadi Faynan contribute new insights to the
question of whether cereals found at these sites were collected or farmed.

feasting in early Andean communities has been strongly discussed by archaeologists. This
paper focuses on the animal remains recovered from the investigations in the Wari site of

and forensic evidence, suggests communal consumption and animal sacrifice practices played
important roles in sociopolitical formation through negotiating and perpetuating political control

underwent frequent transformations over short periods, thus it is essential for the reconstruction
of technological, social and political change to know the relative chronologies of archaeological
sites. Radiocarbon dating is inadequate because of fluctuations in atmospheric production of
radiocarbon during this time range. This pilot study was an experiment in dating Moloko sites by
optically stimulated luminescence and archaeomagnetism.

Using the site of Cuauhtemoc in the Soconusco as a starting point, I examine the earliest

occupation as a local center; yet it was only during the Conchas phase (900-800 BCE) that a 5 m
high mound was built at the site. The Conchas phase was also when the regional center of La
Blanca was founded and a 25 m mound erected. While ambitious leaders had been competing
with each other for centuries, the Conchas phase provides evidence of the first truly stratified
society in the Soconusco.

Subsistence practices in the Predynastic period and the Middle Kingdom are compared using
faunal remains from settlements around Abydos. In recognition that temporal changes in feeding
strategies may in part reflect alterations of the resource base, the impact of palaeoenvironmental
changes is considered. A model is proposed to explain how transformations in human and
natural systems together were responsible for the creation of one of ancient Egypt‘s hallmarks,
the redistributive economy.

agricultural plots with a complex water management system in these open areas, deeply
changing the landscape. Thousands of raised-fields are found along the Guianese coast from
Cayenne Island in French Guiana up to the Essequibo river in Guyana. This technique is

Archaeobotanical analysis, paying only lip service to Darwinian principles basic to systematic
biology, is still pervasively mired in 17th century Creation Science axioms. Reliance on arbitrary,
subjective morphotypes, misleading mean values and unrepresentative normal distributions
obliterate the presence of Darwinian variation in macro- and microscopic assemblages of
archaeobotanical remains. This provides false and unrepresentative reference standards for
analysis and interpretation. Detailed size and shape measurements of large reference
populations provide realistic data to generate distributions of Darwinian variation, exposing
several fallacies in morphological analysis currently accepted as valid and widely employed in
archeobotanical research.

The Chalcolithic period of the southern Levant (c. 4500-3600 BC) is considered by many
archaeologists to have been characterized by hierarchical societies. Diverse, elaborate

such as population growth, settlement hierarchy and craft specialization. Evidence for religious
beliefs and ritual practices is recognized and described in the literature, but with little
discussion of the linkage between religion, ceremonial behavior, social structure and material
culture. Against this background, we examine the possibility that different modes of ritual and
different kinds of practitioners coexisted in the Chalcolithic culture.

[248] South Florida Archaeobotany from the Glades to the Coasts
Archaeobotanical artifacts from south Florida have been among some of the richest finds in the
Americas including the beautiful masks, gourds, and carvings uncovered by Cushing at Key
Marco to the wooden effigies at Fort Center. Contemporary research includes fine-screened
samples of rich and not-so-rich deposits of seeds and wood, which reflect not only the prehistoric
artisans but, also the cooks, carpenters, gardeners, and others. This paper will be a brief
overview of selected South Florida sites that have preserved plant remains and details
provisional methodological and socio-cultural insights we have gleaned from the
archaeobotanical record.

[48] Design and Function of a Royal Palace at San Bartolo, Guatemala
This presentation addresses how the San Bartolo court designed its palace, the Tigrillo
Complex, and maintained it an important locale from the Preclassic period onwards. Its location,
layout, and relationship to other architectural nuclei of the site core suggests that it played a key
role for its builders, and for San Bartolo residents through the Terminal Classic period. Data
from architecture, ceramics, and burials indicate the importance of this palace through time, and
show that San Bartolo maintained an elite class long after the termination and burial of the
murals of the Pinturas Group in the Late Preclassic period.

[172] Lithic Sourcing and Site Evaluation in the Context of Large Scale Survey
Based on 130,000 shovel tests and 60,000 acres of archeological survey, the most common
prehistoric site type in the Fort Drum region is the lithic scatter. Lithic sourcing, in combination
with geographic analysis, provides critical information in terms of the new knowledge these
sites offer. Identifying lithic sources and associated pathways in and out of the region provides
insight into the cultural prehistory of the area. According to the Buffalo Museum of Science,
documented lithic sources on Fort Drum include Paleo and Archaic connections to the eastern
seaboard and Woodland contact with the Ohio Valley to the west.

typically found under platforms on the south and west of the house, while human burials are
usually in the north and east. We examine the range of contents of these commemorative
deposits in relation to other lines of evidence regarding the consumption and meanings of

[8] Deconstructing Shell Circles: Subsistence, Ceremony, or Synchrony?
The idea that Southeastern U.S. Archaic shell rings represent village sites, ceremonial centers,
or monuments has previously been presented as mutually exclusive hypotheses. Recent
excavations, ethnographic comparisons, and theories of social space and feasting suggest that
Archaic shell rings served these functions simultaneously. Two millennia later, ring-shaped
Weeden Island sites were constructed on the Florida Gulf Coast. As with the Archaic rings, these
sites held domestic and ceremonial, but not monumental functions. Internal structure, layout, and
position of Archaic and Weeden Island ring sites provide data that help resolve issues of site
function for both cultures.

[87] The Persistence of Local Traditions and Memory at La Milpa, Belize
As a city located at the boundary of three major regional states, La Milpa‘s elite potters and
artisans incorporated many diverse regional stylistic and technological attributes. However,
non-elites‘ ceramic repertoire changed more slowly and there was continued use of local
stylistic and technological traditions. The resilience and persistence of local practices during
the Early-to-Late Classic transition is examined through a careful seriation of ceramic
attributes from a range of contexts as well as a theoretical consideration of elite and non-elite
local memory and traditions in the face of extra-local hegemonizing effects.

[17] The Oldowan Record in North Africa
Much of the Plio-Pleistocene data on the Oldowan is primarily from sites in East Africa.
However, recent investigations undertaken at Ain Hanech (Algeria) have broadened the
Oldowan range to North Africa. Dated to 1.78 million years ago, Ain Hanech yielded Oldowan
assemblages associated with a savanna-like fauna contained in floodplain deposits. The
industry comprises core forms, debitage, and retouched pieces, and is a North African variant
of the Oldowan Industrial Complex. The site may be viewed as repeated occupations by early
hominins at some water wholes and river embankment likely attracted by good quality raw
materials and by abundant games.

[35] Application of Lithic and Spatial Analysis to the Identification of Discreet Occupations
     at Multicomponent Sites
The results of spatial and lithic debitage analysis conducted from a particularly debitage-rich
portion of a multi-component site in western New York are examined. The primary component of
the site is a sixteenth-century Iroquoian village. Frequently, archaeologists treat material
recovered from multi-component sites as representative of the primary, or largest, component.
Analyses conducted for this study suggest the presence of an Early Woodland Meadowood
component. While additional work will strengthen this interpretation, the identification of an Early
Woodland lithic workshop within a plowed, multi-component site adds to our understanding of
both site disturbance and prehistoric settlement patterns in the region.

non-weeds, suggesting that during the Early Agriculture Period a mixed economy of foraging
and farming was practiced. Changes on food resources throughout this period probably indicate
a population growth during the Cienega phase and the existence of a fulltime agricultural

We review shell-bearing site types and the history of their study for the Peruvian coast. This
region has the New World‘s longest and most continuous record of shell-bearing, maritime
adapted sites, from Paleoindian (13,000 cal. yr BP) to modern. However, few sites are composed
entirely of shell and fish remains, and archaeology of the region does not have a developed

shell-bearing sites have played critical roles in many dimensions of Andean archaeology, from
subsistence to paleoclimate to theoretical statements on the rise of complex society.

Considerable attention has been devoted to documenting the existence of indigenous crops in

replacement by maize, beans and squash. However, husbandry practices have received only
passing attention despite their relevance for these topics. I argue that the terms horticulture
and agriculture, often associated with indigenous crops and maize respectively, have
misleading connotations. Most indigenous crops would be more efficient to plant and harvest if
grown in "pure" stands. In contrast, the widespread intercropping of the "three sisters" attests
to their productivity when grown in mixed stands.

intensities through time.

and may be valid for other regions in the tropical forest. This is an alternative to traditional
models that explain cultural complexity resulting from agricultural intensification.

importance of an inventory, a patchwork of approaches exists across the country. Transportation
enhancement funds help some SHPOs populate inventories. Federal agencies assist State

kingdoms of Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan. Archaeological and epigraphic data indicate that
each polity developed distinct strategies for hierarchical control within the body politic, resulting
in two distinct political formations, as Piedras Negras and Yaxchilan transformed themselves
from minor Early Classic centers to dominant Late Classic powers.

The archaeological investigations at Tak´lik Ab´aj during recent years have made significant
advances in understanding the development of this ancient city and the region of the South
Coast. These advances have opened up new questions and have put into perspective topics
which require more attention, especially those involving the directions to be taken for future
investigations. They also highlight the need to focus on these questions within the concept of
interaction between the diverse regions of the South Coast during its history.

[143] Experimental Archaeology, Bone Fires, and Palaeolithic Behavior
Fire represents a major technological and behavioral development in human evolution. At Hohle
Fels Cave, Swabian Jura, a high burnt bone/ fine charcoal ratio indicates bone as a prominent
fuel during the Last Glacial. Micromorphology and microchemical analysis of a burnt bone layer
indicate a discard zone away from the original combustion zone. To better understand the
burning qualities of bone, 30 kg were burnt in an experimental campfire with measurements from
soil micromorphology, coal petrology, electron microscopy, temperature properties of the
substrate and the combustion products. The results are compared to burnt bone layers from Old
World Palaeolithic sites.

[110] The Tyranny of the Statistical Paradigm in Archaeology
James Hill and other early processualists exploited the availability of computers and statistical
packages to launch a distinctive statistical archaeology. In using these powerful tools,
archaeologists assumed that the past behavioral patterns of interest were faithfully preserved
and that their traces conformed to statistical requirements. This assumption has been overturned
by decades of research on formation processes, including reanalyses of Hill's study of Broken
K's marital residence patterns. Regrettably, archaeologists continue to publish analyses as
deeply flawed as those of the early processualists. This paper discusses the appalling state of
statistical analysis in archaeology.

[243] Migratory Fish Resources and Delaware Valley Prehistory
Assumptions concerning Middle Woodland settlement and subsistence patterns in the Delaware
Valley are largely based upon the presumed exploitation of the upstream migration of
anadromous fish. This relatively narrow perception of the migratory fish resource is incomplete
and should be expanded to include not only other aspects of anadromous fish life cycles but
other migratory fish as well. Archaeological, ethnohistorical, ethnographical, biological, and
experimental data are combined to offer a holistic representation of the migratory fish resource in
the Delaware Valley during the Middle Woodland period and its impact on our understanding of
Middle Woodland life.

[199] Local Actions in Global Context: Adapting to the Holocene in Iberia
The transition from Pleistocene to Holocene remodeled the world in ways strikingly similar to
those noted by the frameworks convention for the Kyoto Protocol. The Iberian Peninsula is a
natural laboratory for understanding these processes. From demographic shifts in the
Cantabrian refugium to relative constancy in the Mediterranean region, it is a crossroads where
widespread European influences overlapped distinctive Iberian traditions. The introduction of
agriculture further diversified the patchwork of subsistence strategies. Adaptation to the
Holocene in Iberia forms a baseline for understanding the social and economic dynamics of
local human response to global climate change.

The Department of Energy (DOE) is in the process of conveying lands to the County of Los
Alamos and to the Pueblo of San Ildefonso. These lands are located in tracts that contained
archaeological sites in areas suitable for commercial and/or residential development by Los
Alamos County. Two Middle Coalition period (AD 1200 to 1250) roomblocks, located some 500
meters apart, were excavated in one of these tracts. This paper compares and contrasts the
major characteristics of these linear-shaped roomblock sites and uses this information to address
the formation of social identity on the Pajarito Plateau during the Coalition period.

[138] Edge Offset Indices in Biface Stage Analysis
Archeologists have recommended developing morphology indices to serve in testing the
reliability of biface stage typologies. While indices that measure progressive changes in the size
and mass of bifaces have proved useful, we describe an independent approach based on edge
sinuosity or offset. This index measures the divergence of a biface edge from linearity. Results of
application of the index to biface samples from several Paleoarchaic sites in the central Great
Basin show good agreement with thinning indices and help to delineate regional patterns of
biface manufacture and transport.

projects to create historic map layers overlaid onto modern maps to locate sensitive
archaeological areas and to design and implement archaeological testing and data recovery

of San Francisco and the Downtown Stockton Redevelopment Project in California, where GIS
layers containing historic map information from multiple time periods were integral to creating
predictive maps of where significant cultural deposits were located.

In recent centuries, Balinese farmers working neighboring village-level irrigation systems have
been bound into webs of interdependence by issues of water and pest control. By promoting
membership overlaps between villages and agro-managerial groups, this seems to have affected
the evolution of social organization. To advance understanding of how landscape factors
contributed to this phenomenon, data on extant irrigation systems and archaeological find-site
distributions are combined and supplemented with sub-surface tests and additional geospatial
information to build a tentative regional synthesis mapping the expansion of irrigated agriculture
in the research area (Gianyar Regency, Bali, Indonesia) over the last 2000 years.

plain ware ceramics. This study uses weighted mean ceramic dating of the Wupatki
Archaeological Survey database and in-depth analysis of a sample of early sites to develop a

suggest geographically-conditioned variability in initial settlement strategies. The implications
in the context of a frontier setting are explored.

[121] Symmetry and Consilience in Heritage Management Practice: A new New Archaeology
In England heritage management practice has traditionally been concerned with that which is
truly historic, from antiquity even. But gradually that distant past has been creeping up on
heritage practitioners. One aspect of a new characterisation programme explores the character
of the later twentieth century landscape, not as a pollutant, destroying the "idyll" that existed
previously, but as a contributor to landscape character. It is this new archaeology, of perceptions,
artistic interventions and larger scale spatial enquiries that I will address here, giving a new-
found symmetry to heritage management practice, filling the gaps we didn‘t know existed until
very recently.

duration of human occupations is an important component of such endeavors, as these factors
profoundly influence characteristics of human impacts. Architectural studies at two large

[5] Here Lyes Ye Spatial Patterns: Epitaphs of Cultural Transmission from Historic New

The diffusion of artifact design styles distorts regional chronologies based on frequency
seriation. This study revisits James Deetz and Edwin Dethlefsen‘s study of historic New
England gravestones to examine the spatial patterns of stylistic diffusion. Stylistic diffusion can
be traced through time with the spatial and temporal controls gravestones offer. Interpolation
methods and autocorrelation measures that were unavailable in the 1960‘s are used to identify
spatial processes. Cultural transmission of carving styles is inferred from the temporal and
spatial patterning of idiosyncratic carving traditions. Broader cultural changes are inferred from
the spread of regional consumption preferences.

under the auspices of the Eastern Korinthia Archaeological Survey in Greece. The experiments
were designed specifically to test the methods developed by Mediterranean surveys, however,
the results are applicable anywhere surface survey is practiced. In addition, I incorporate aspects
of vigilance theory in order to explain why some of these biases occur.

[234] Contesting for Power in the Prehistoric Naco Valley, NW Honduras: Two Millennia of

Research conducted in the 100km2 Naco valley, NW Honduras reveals a long history of shifting
power structures. From the Middle Preclassic (1200-400 BC) through the Late Postclassic (AD
1300-1500), degrees of political centralization varied as did the ways in which power relations
were structured. Corporate bodies of various sorts exercised suzerainty during most of this span
save for the Late Classic (AD 600-800) when charismatic magnates briefly seized power. Factors
underlying this failure of individualized rule are considered as are the consequences of enduring
corporate political principles for the structure and operation of Naco‘s agrestic centers.

[116] Huari Urbanism in Middle Horizon Peru
Inspired by recent reconsiderations of the evolution of ancient states and archaeological
approaches to them, this paper addresses the nature of Middle Horizon Huari, and its interactive
relationship with the polity of which it was capital. Briefly considered are the pre-MH foundations
of the city, changes in the city‘s size and configuration during the MH, its relationship to its
immediate hinterland, and its place within a polity-wide network of administrative sites. I conclude
that Huari‘s emergence and transformation during the MH was intimately tied to the emergence
and growth of the state/empire, and vice versa.

The objective of this research is to define "defensive" as it applies to archaeological sites in
Wyoming and to determine with which time period these sites are associated. Re-examination of
sites located within largely inaccessible terrain or that include intact architectural features are the
focus of defining both the age and characteristics of defendable sites within Wyoming.
Preliminary results indicate that Wyoming's defensive sites correlate with known periods of
conflict in the American Southwest and the Great Plains region. From this it may be possible to
develop a model for cultural characteristics that are associated with prehistoric warfare.

[128] Interpersonal Violence in Neolithic Britain
Interpersonal violence is a powerful expression of human social interaction. Yet a consideration
of violence in the past has done relatively little to inform discussions of the British Neolithic. A
recent examination of some 350 crania reveals a number of healed or unhealed injuries
suggestive of interpersonal violence. These data are used as a platform to discuss possible
contexts for, and consequences of, violence. It is argued that, regardless of its actual prevalence,
the reality or the threat of violence can have an important affect on both the behaviour of
individuals and the structure of society.

Excavations at Las Canoas, NW Honduras recovered a previously unknown artifact class,

made deliberately as potstands, and ones recycled from broken jars. The stands vary in these
ways: the clays used to make them; aperture diameter; height; shape; use as a support while
vessels were being shaped; use as kiln furniture, where they do not appear to be classic
saggars, separating stacked vessels, but individual vessel supports; distributions and
concentrations at Canoas and its dependent sites. This paper examines the significance of these
variations within the potstand category.

[150] Visual Displays and Social Strategies in Magdalenian Western Europe ca. 17-11,000 BP
Magdalenian-age hunter-gatherers in Western Europe used large numbers and/or similar kinds
of visual displays—including exotic materials, personal ornamentation, and decorated objects—
at certain times and places. In an extensive study, I determined that length of time since regional
colonization—more than population density—encouraged social competition and the use of
those visual signals. Evidence from newly (re-)colonized regions (e.g., Middle Magdalenian
Pyrenees; Upper Magdalenian West-Central Germany) illustrates those findings and contrasts
with that from continuously inhabited regions (e.g., Southwestern France; Cantabrian Spain),
broadening the range of variability known for prehistoric hunter-gatherer social organization.

Because the texts from early historic periods are limited in both number and kind, scant

societies by integrating local and regional archaeological data with the documentary evidence.

[147] Multiple Levels of Meaning: Figurine Patterns at Cancuén, El Petén Department, Guatemala
Six excavation seasons at the Late Classic polity of Cancuén has yielded abundant figurine
remains, which have proved to be amenable to varying levels of analytical exploration. This
portable art form permits insights into the roles that it might have played in Cancuén society, as
domestic markers or as components in thematically-charged trade relationship. The multiple
levels of meaning found in the nature and distribution of figurines at Cancuén is viewed within the
larger perspective afforded by the study of other figurines recovered along the riverways in the
region.

[164] Social Status and Spatial Organization in Classic Maya Residential Architecture:
       Insights from Belize
This paper seeks to examine the correlation between social status and spatial segregation in
residential architecture that ethno-archaeologist Susan Kent posited existed in complex
societies. In particular, this paper seeks to examine the correlation between social status as can
be inferred through the examination of residential architecture and the degree of spatial
partitioning and segregation that can be inferred through space syntax analyses of these
architectural groups. This paper revisits some of the data gathered as part of the author's M.A.

[134] We Have Met our Ancestor and He is Us: Teaching Archaeology Through Robert
       Humphrey's AnthroNotes Cartoons
For the late Robert Humphrey, self-examination of his identity as archaeologist and artist led to a
broad reflexive commentary on archaeology and archaeologists. His cartoons reflect a
profoundly reflexive view of human origins, making explicit the role of the archaeologist in telling
a story based on data. This paper focuses on the ―Early Ancestor‖ cartoons published in
AnthroNotes, reflecting Humphrey's original interest in PaleoIndians, the eastern Eurasian
paleolithic, and the settlement of the New World. Examining and teaching archaeology through
these amusing, insightful cartoons reveals Humphrey‘s own imaginative world, its recurring
iconic figures, values, norms, social networks, and enduring insights.

[181] The Destruction of Tomb A, Xoxocotlán, Oaxaca
In 1886, a spectacular Zapotec tomb was unearthed in Xoxocotlán, Oaxaca. The structure,
consisting of an elaborate stucco façade and sealed by a stone slab inscribed with hieroglyphic
writing, was one of the first ancient monuments Leopoldo Batres attempted to conserve as
Inspector of Archaeological Monuments. Unfortunately, he failed to save the crypt for posterity,
and by the 1920s it had been completely obliterated by the forces of nature and by looting. In my

structure and its contents using a variety of documentary sources.

[17] The Oldowan at Gona (2.6-2.5 Million years), Afar, Ethiopia
The Gona sites document the oldest stone artifacts dated to 2.6-2.5 million years (Ma).
During the early 1990s thousands of artifacts predominantly made of trachyte and rhyolite
were systematically excavated from EG-10 and EG-12. Recently, a large number of sites
were documented from widely distributed contemporary deposits, and systematic
excavations at OGS-6 and OGS-7 have produced artifacts and associated fragmentary
bones providing a direct evidence that the earliest stone tools were used for processing
animal carcasses. The makers had sophisticated understanding of conchoidal fracture
mechanics, they selected for raw materials with good flaking qualities and produced sharp-
edged cores and flakes primarily used as cutting tools. The technology of the oldest artifacts
from Gona shows a clear affinity with the Oldowan Industry.

[96] Cultigens of the American Northeast: A Phytolith Study
The aims of this research are to create a phytolith reference collection for commonly utilized
cultigens in Northeast American prehistory. Twenty species were selected for this study and the
presence or absence of morphologically diagnostic phytoliths was determined. Phytoliths are
opaline silica bodies which occur in the stems, leaves, roots, and inflorescences of plants.
Since phytoliths are mineral, they resist decay and do not require a particular preservation
condition. As a result, phytoliths are a practical tool in archaeology and paleoecology. Phytoliths
recovered from archaeological contexts are examined and compared to typologies from
reference collections using the methodological approach of uniformitarianism.

[252] Stone Tools in the Scandinavian Iron Age
Despite the common belief that stone tools quickly disappear during the Iron Age in Scandinavia,
flint continues to be an important raw material, used alongside iron, through the Middle Ages.
Though this topic is under-researched, it has great potential for illuminating economic life in the
Iron Age. An analysis of 241 Swedish sites excavated from 1970 to 1996 indicates that the
presence of flint at sites through Southern Sweden decreases from the Late Bronze Age through
the Middle Ages, but does not disappear completely. This paper argues that lithic analysis should

Well-preserved roofs at Chevelon reveal unique construction strategies and wood recycling
behavior through time. Villagers relied on driftwood for roof construction. The challenges of
working with a limited supply of variable quality materials are reflected in construction style. The
presence of burned beams in otherwise unburned roofs suggests that conifer primaries were
recycled numerous times. Natural planks of ponderosa pine and cottonwood served as
secondary and tertiary materials in many rooms. Holding room size constant, beam diameters
decrease and the number of beams used per roof increases over time. This trend implies
exhaustion of resources as the pueblo grew.

purposes such as scholarship, tourism, identity, and entertainment. Without a theory of
archaeological goods, the relative significance of each use is hard to measure. I suggest that the

[28] Sacred Cows or Sirloin?
Cattle occur in many contexts in the Near Eastern Neolithic and there seems little doubt that
they played both ceremonial and economic roles on the mainland. Recent research in
Cyprus has documented small amounts of cattle in early Neolithic contexts, a surprising
development since cattle had not previously been known until the Bronze Age. Despite their
early presence, however, they disappear by the later Neolithic Khirokiita Culture. This paper
discusses some of the possible roles that cattle may have played in the initial colonization of
Cyprus, examining both ritual and economic scenarios.

[189] Maya Metallurgy and the Late Postclassic-Spanish Colonial Period Political Economy
      of Lamanai, Belize
The Maya Archaeometallurgy Project (MAP) is in its fifth year at Lamanai, Belize. The research
is focused on understanding the roles that copper metallurgy played in the political economy of
Lamanai in Postclassic and Spanish Colonial times. At present, more copper objects have been
recovered during controlled archaeological excavations at Lamanai than at any other Maya site.
The results of recent research suggest that Lamanai‘s Spanish colonial period administrator, the
cacique, may have controlled some aspects of the production and distribution of copper objects
at Lamanai. The results of chemical compositional analyses, and other MAP research, will be
presented here.

[160] Evidence for Prehistoric Agave Fermentation in the Greater Southwest
Agave was a ritually significant plant and important source of food throughout the history of
Native societies of the Southwest. Archaeological research has recognized the harvesting
and roasting of agave, but has given little attention to fermentation. We assess ethnographic
accounts, archaeological features and artifacts, and experimental replication to re-evaluate
the use of agave fermentation at Salado Platform Mounds of central Arizona. We conclude
that in addition to consuming roasted agave, the preparation of agave wine at prehistoric
ceremonial centers likely played an important role in the communal feasting performed at
platform mound communities during the Hohokam Classic period.

will document LIP political trajectories across different regions that were earlier on variously
affected by the Tiwanaku and Wari states. One problem addressed here is the (mis)conception
of Horizons and Intermediate Periods as synonyms for homogenous and balkanized political
periods, respectively. Data for LIP will be compared between coastal valleys to understand how
various forms of Wari and Tiwanaku influence are contingent to the development of different

[40] Spatial Structure of Middle Stone Age Sites from the Lower Omo Valley Kibish Formation
     (Ethiopia)
The Middle-Late Pleistocene Kibish Formation of the Lower Omo Valley (Ethiopia) contains
some of the oldest-dated Homo sapiens fossils. Archaeological excavations in the Omo Kibish
between 2002-2003 recovered numerous stone tools from extensive horizontal exposures of two
sites, KHS (195 ±5 kyr) and BNS (104 ±7 kyr). Because of time and logistic constraints the
precision of excavation was limited square meter resolution. Despite this, GIS-based analysis of
artifact distributions, micro-debitage densities, and refitting artifact constellations sheds light on
site formation processes. Both localities reveal weak patterns of differentiation and BNS seems
to have a preferred refit orientation.

[227] Cold Case: Investigating Archaeological "Crime Scenes"
Crimes not solved within the first 48 hours of their commission often remain unsolved. Thus
looking for illicit activities in the archaeological record is truly working a "cold case." The historical
record in the Caribbean is full of depositions concerning pirates, smugglers, and other criminal
types. But where is the physical evidence? How did these interlopers alter the ways of life for
law-abiding residents? Were the reports mere propaganda or is there genuine evidence of
criminal behavior? We will examine the archaeological evidence for illicit trading and raiding
activities and how they shaped the Spanish colonial world.

Study of postdepositional changes of human bodies sheds light on mortuary treatment of the
dead. We examine the skeleton VSE501 from the medieval cemetery of Všeruby (Czech
Republic) to evaluate the effect of pathology on taphonomic processes. VSE501 shows a highly
variable degree of skeletal element dislocation. The combination of markers typical for simple
graves covered with soil and those with delineated empty space was puzzling. Since pathological
alterations of the vertebral column were identified, careful scrutiny of taphonomic data allowed us
build a model of the effects of pathology on burial evidence.

Models of subsistence-settlement have been generated to explain highly diverse faunal and floral
assemblages that do not conform to patterns of change between the Middle and Late Woodland
elsewhere in the Midwest and Great Lakes. Models assume that the Late Woodland will display
radical changes from earlier patterns. Recent analyses of floral and faunal assemblages from
several sites indicate that Middle and Late Woodland resource exploitation patterns do not reflect
radically different strategies. This study tests the assumption that change in material culture is
tied to change in subsistence-settlement behavior in an environment with a diverse natural

Considerable progress has been made in recent years in documenting the initial domestication of

early chapters in the transition from hunting-and-gathering to food production economies in
temporal and cultural context. Recognizing the subsequent initial emergence of agricultural
economies in the archaeological record of different work regions, however, has proven much
more difficult. Difficulties in defining what agriculture is, and how it can be recognized in the
archaeological record, are discussed, and several case study examples are presented.

[105] Late Holocene Variability in Artiodactyl Use in the Wyoming Basin, Wyoming
Wyoming Basin archaeofaunal data suggest that the more mesic late Holocene provided higher
encounter rates with artiodactyls when compared to the warmer/dryer early and middle Holocene
periods. Although late Holocene components on average indicate greater artiodactyl
abundances, the remains from individual assemblages range from exclusively small mammals to
only artiodactyls. This paper examines the hypotheses that the late Holocene variability reflects
environmental heterogeneity, with artiodactyls more common in patches offering more favorable
habitats. We find that both fine grained spatial and temporal variables condition the pattern.

The present research uses ceramic assemblages to answer questions about mobility strategies

frequent residential mobility to increasing sedentism provides an opportunity to examine the
social and economic consequences of changing mobility strategies. The Middle Woodland
Cuesta phase provides a case study for exploring this shift. I propose that groups who are
becoming more sedentary may place increased emphasis on mobility as a social strategy for risk
reduction. Ceramics provide measures for residential mobility and inter-group interaction.

supernatural world. Evidence from recent economic ethnographies, the Popol Vuh, and most
specifically, archaeological materials from caves in the Cancuén region will be presented to
support this argument.

[53] Variability in Preceramic Lifeways and Models of Emerging Andean Complexity
Late Early (ca. 8,500-8000 BP) and Middle Preceramic (ca. 8000-4500 BP) research on the
north coast of Peru increasingly indicates organizational variability, even in neighboring valleys.
As some societies became more sedentary and began to practice intensive horticulture, as in
the Zaña Valley, others continued to practice logistical mobility with a heavy reliance on wild
plant and animal resources from various zones, as in the Jequetepeque Valley. Still other
patterns are observed among Preceramic societies elsewhere in the Andes. This variability is
explored in relation to wider models of the development of complex societies.

[125] Archaic Landscapes, Changing Mobility Strategies, and Intra-Site Spatial Analysis at
       the Caesars Archaeological Project
Early and Middle Archaic groups in the lower Ohio Valley are usually viewed as mobile hunter-
gatherers compared to the more sedentary Late Archaic period. The spatial arrangement of
environmental characteristics (landscape elements) on paleolandscapes partially structures the
pattern of hunter-gatherer movements. Large-scale block excavations and extensive studies of
landscape evolution at the CAP provides an opportunity to compare intra-site spatial patterns
between Early, Middle, and Late Archaic hunter-gatherers. Differential spatial patterns of artifacts
and features are viewed as a function of changes in mobility strategies through the Holocene.
This study suggests that patterns of mobility change are non-linear through time.

[109] Reconsidering the Role of Early Long-Distance Interaction to the Origins of Andean
       Civilization
Multidisciplinary evidence indicates that the elementary forms underlying Native Andean
interaction may have their basis in the ancient past. A study of early Andean pottery sites
suggests that a religious cult associated with the spread of ceramic innovation may have
provided the ideological basis for subsequent complex social organization in different regions of
the Andes. The primary material constituents and symbolic correlates of this religious cult are
outlined. Later ethnohistoric evidence of religious cults in colonial Ecuador and Peru suggests
that certain elements and concepts therein may be traced back to the origins of Andean
civilization.

[177] Donde se Fue? Reconciling Early Postclassic Regional Settlement Patterns in a Post-
       Overlap Northern Lowlands
With the deletion of the Early Postclassic as a ceramic period in Yucatecan chronology, a
large vacuum has been opened in our understanding of settlement patterns from the period
AD 700-1300. In this paper, I suggest that the Early Postclassic may still be a viable
chronological period for the northern Lowlands. Architectural evidence from numerous sites
across the peninsula suggests varied responses to the so-called collapse in the ninth century
AD forcing us to rethink how we should use ceramics as chronological markers during the
Mesoamerican Early Postclassic. I discuss the implications of these data regarding regional
settlement patterns.

[49] Perspectives on Mesoamerican Urban Gardens
Building on the work of Evans (2000) I consider the economic, social, and symbolic dimensions

social ostentation of gardens and their economic contributions have not played a substantial role
in Mesoamerican urban studies, and comparative evidence suggests that this oversight is a
substantial handicap in analyzing ancient cities. Examples from the western lower Papaloapan
basin in Veracruz, Mexico, are one substantive focus.

[215] Subsistence Change in the Middle to Upper Paleolithic in Greece: Klissoura Cave 1 and

Little is known about subsistence patterns in southern Greece during the Middle and Upper
Paleolithic. Recent analyses of the Middle Paleolithic layers at Klissoura Cave 1 (Peloponnese)
coupled with results from one previous study of the Upper Paleolithic layers indicate subsistence
changes broadly similar to those that occurred elsewhere in the Mediterranean. Late Mousterian
diets consisted of medium ungulates and slow-moving small game, while early Upper Paleolithic
inhabitants relied primarily on medium ungulates supplemented by some small quick types. An
additional dietary shift occurred in the late Aurignacian, involving greater reliance on fast-moving,
small game.

[90] Prehistoric Human Impact on Vertebrate Communities in Tropical America
Human presence affects terrestrial vertebrate communities through habitat modification, hunting,
and fishing. Ceramic-making peoples of recent millennia encountered highly varied vertebrate
communities in the American tropics. Archaeofaunas from islands often include the remains of
species that either are extinct or no longer occur on that island. In spite of local resource
depression, continental vertebrate faunas have been much more resilient to human presence.
Most archaeofaunal information from the continental Neotropics is from mountainous or arid
regions. A challenge is to develop detailed zooarchaeological records for vast areas, such as
Amazonia and the Guianas, where such information is sparse or lacking.

[85] Fertile Ground for Christianity: Rational Chiefs and Institutional Change in Viking Age
     Iceland
During the Viking Age (872-1264), the people of Iceland maintained a series of chiefly
institutions that prevented the concentration of power. The adoption of Christianity in 1000 AD
and the introduction of the tithe in 1096 have been credited with changing the institutional
structure within which elites struggled for power. Here we argue that institutions associated with
Christianity were only adopted after productivity and soil fertility became differentiated to the
degree that ownership and land control became practical. In Viking Age Iceland, institutions of
property seem to respond to economic changes, as classical economic theory would predict.

Managing the investigation of archaeological resources and the resultant archaeological

The Mississippian Southeast commonly is envisioned as a landscape inhabited by maize
farmers, organized as chiefdoms, with local and regional administrative centers marked by the
presence of earthen platform mounds. Although recent research on small communities and
farmsteads has demonstrated great diversity in Mississippian settlement patterns and lifeways,
little interest has been directed toward groups who resisted the farming life and the trappings of
Mississippian life and persisted as hunter-gatherers in the interstices of the Mississippian world.
This paper focuses on one such group-Ocmulgee hunter-gatherers of the Georgia Coastal

Maycock‘s Point, dating between circa AD 200 and AD 900, contains a high degree of integrity
and is well suited to examining why Woodland patterns of lacustrine resource exploitation at this

stopped as a result of a pronounced decline in water temperature associated with the end of the
Medieval Warm Period. We evaluate this hypothesis by analyzing the shell Mg/Ca ratios by
inductively coupled mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Selected shells analyzed by ICP-MS will be
radiocarbon dated to further define temporal trends based upon stratigraphic analysis.

period. Such complementary economic roles for men and women may not have appeared in
Eurasia until the earliest Upper Paleolithic. Neandertals displayed a much narrower reliance on
large game animals, which also constrained the demographic potential of Neandertal
populations. Broadly based economies with a wider range of economic and technological roles
may have provided modern humans with a demographic advantage over other hominins in
Eurasia during the Late Pleistocene, perhaps an inadvertent consequence of local expansions in
dietary breadth in low-latitude habitats.

[147] The Distribution of Mazapan- Xochiquetzal Figurines as Possible Indicator of a Toltec
       Empire
It is proposed that Early-Postclassic Xochiquetzal-Mazapan figurines indicate a weaving cult.
Figurines, spindle whorls and cotton production throughout Mesoamerica are discussed as
possible expressions of this cult. We propose that the proliferation of weaving at Tula was not the
result of innovations to be used only there, but rather the promoting of a pan-empire clothing
style. The widespread distribution and content of Xochiquetzal- Mazapan figurines might
therefore be read as indicating a Toltec Empire, built upon military subjugation. We propose that
the Toltecs were responsible for the final demise of Teotihuacan, through military defeat, with
Xochiquetzal-Mazapan figurines providing a clue.

[233] Imperial Immaturity and the Eccentricities of Early Empire: Archaeological Approaches
      to the Umayyad Qusūr of the Early Islamic Period Levant
Building projects, monumentality and imperial intentions tend to be inextricably linked in the
archaeological record as well as anthropological theory. Efforts by the state and specific rulers to
establish their authority over territories and subject populations through architectural forms has
been well documented in numerous cross-cultural studies. These studies, however, have tended
to understand the state as a purposeful and almost clairvoyant actor in their attempts to employ
the built environment in particular strategies of rule and control. By contrast, this paper questions
whether the state actually operates with such forethought or can it in fact make mistakes,
especially in its early stages of empire building. In presenting an examination of the enigmatic

[142] Proposal to Recover and Store Archaeological Information of Small Sites in Central Mexico
Cultural resource management is one of the most serious problems concerning with present
archaeological practices in Mexico. The main tendency of the Mesoamerican Archaeology has
been focused on sites with monumental architectures, whereas many small sites have been and
are being destroyed. In this paper we discuss, based on the importance of these sites not only
because of their numerical preponderance in the archaeological universe, but also for a better
problems characteristics of non monumental sites. We also propose an such as archaeology,
archaeometry, geophysics, visualization and computer analysis. Due to the fact that the
conservation of these sites information obtained from the field work. From this point of view, the
integration of the results of these studies is fundamental to create a data base with variables
which satisfy diverse characteristics of archaeological research inquiry.

This research explores the distribution and function of candeleros from six zones in the city of
Teotihuacan. Spatial analysis of specific attributes in relation to site types, neighborhoods, and
the associated ceramic types with which they are found identified clustering of specific attributes.
This distribution hints at the function of candeleros which is still not clearly understood. These
patterns help interpret ritual behavior at the household level, link potential indicators of ritual
functions of candeleros, and may indicate distinctions between barrio groups.

[100] On the Optimal Size of Lithic Surpluses
Archaeological sites regularly produce evidence that humans procured more lithic raw material
than was absolutely needed at individual sites (e.g., abandoned large cores). Yet, the acquisition
of lithic raw materials is a costly activity and procuring more stone than necessary has clear
disadvantages. In this paper, I develop a formal mathematical model of optimal lithic surplus
creation. I assume that the benefit of surplus creation is preventing or minimizing the possibility
of unpredictable and potentially costly lithic shortfalls. Data from Puntutjarpa Rockshelter
(Australia) and five late Pleistocene archaeological sites from Wyoming and Colorado provide
support for the model.

[160] Agricultural Sustainability and Community Resilience during the Transition to Agriculture:
      A Mimbres Mogollon Case Study
My dissertation research investigates community resilience and the sustainability of farming
strategies during the transition to agriculture in the Mimbres region. Recent models see early
pithouse communities as highly mobile, using low-intensity agricultural techniques. Subsequent
adoption of more productive maize varieties enabled establishment of sedentary villages along
major rivers, but population pressure promoted intensive agricultural techniques and
detrimental environmental impacts. This created a less resilient system, resulting in collapse
and regional abandonment. I reevaluate this sequence using multiple lines of evidence to
investigate the resilient nature of settlements in arid landscapes and the ability of farming
communities to navigate change.

Imperial conquest is generally accompanied by changes in elite material culture through

local high-status products continued and may have increased through local processes and/or
Inca co-option of Chimu styles. Research from El Brujo in the Chicama Valley suggests that the
decentralization of Chimu administration provided a mechanism for local level lords to increase
their authority and wealth by producing their own elite products. Why local leaders continued to

The early Paleoindian period is characterized by a widespread artifact style (Clovis and related

Later in the Paleoindian period there is a shift in the archaeological record with evidence for
region-specific artifact styles, a diversification of tool kits, and increased utilization of local

always change in the same direction. This paper considers mutinies, rebellions, uprisings and
social disorder in Iron Age and Early Medieval Scandinavia from both elite and non-elite
perspectives, through archaeological data, ethnohistorical and historical documents,
ethnographic analogy, and contemporary social theory.

[21] Controlling the Means of Production: Textile Manufacture and the Gendered Body in the
     Inka Empire
Drawing from the fields of phenomenology, feminist theory, and technology studies, this paper
shows the ways in which Andean peoples' participation in textile production simultaneously
produced them as gendered bodies. The primary subject of this analysis is the aclla, or chosen
women, and their position within the Inka state. The potential of examining gender and craft
production from a body-centered viewpoint is examined in relation to other interpretations of the
aclla, such as those of Zuidema, Murra, and Silverblatt. Additionally, the impact of 16th century
European conceptions of the body in colonial accounts of the aclla is explored.

[47] Maya Dynastic Burials and the Recreation of Posthumous Body Treatments of Ancient
     Aristocracy
The recreation of Classic Maya noble biographies has witnessed important advances in recent
years, drawing increasingly also from skeletal studies. This study on posthumous body
treatments is founded on the human taphonomy and residue analysis of 18 Classic period elite
burials from Calakmul, Palenque, Toniná and Ek Balam, five of which have been assigned to
named dynasts. Enhanced with information gleaned from epigraphy and material culture, our
results provide new insights on the personalized death cult and the complex ritual treatments of
dead paramounts, while at the same time pointing toward some potential pitfalls in taphonomic
appraisals in the region.

[35] A Buried Archaic Component in the Southeastern Lake Huron Basin
Recent excavations on the South Bend site located in southern Ontario revealed a buried
paleosol that yielded faunal and artifactual materials probably contemporary with the Nipissing
Phase of Lake Huron (ca. 5000 BP). The stone tool assemblage includes projectile points that
are similar to water-worn points from the nearby Pascoe site located along the southern margin
of the Nipissing beach. Morphological correlates to these artifacts exist throughout the lower
Great Lakes and the Midwest. This paper describes the South Bend collections and, through
comparative analyses, places them in the context of the Archaic in the lower Great Lakes and
Midwest.

[225] Predicting the Past-Prehistoric Probability Modeling through GIS Tools
The interior northwest landscape is made up of glacially scoured steep mountain side-slopes,
narrow river valleys, lacustrine terraces, glacial lakes and dense vegetation. It is home to 8,000
years of hunter and gatherer prehistory. The dense vegetation makes archaeological survey
challenging, contributing to minimal ground visibility. The Forest Heritage Program team has
turned to predictive modeling to provide an additional survey tool. The prehistoric probability GIS
model uses landform, water, vegetation, slope and aspect to order predictions for site density.
This tool has proven to be invaluable in providing focus for areas to conduct subsurface testing
as part of survey.

[244] Dark Visions from the Ocean: Lucayan Perspective on a Spanish Vessel
Columbus' first landfall in the Americas was on Guanahani/San Salvador one of the Lucayos
islands, now called the Bahamas. Within 30 years of this momentous voyage the people who
greeted this crew were gone; enslaved and relocated elsewhere. Having no written language,
archaeology is a major source of information about these early Bahamians. Examination of
archaeological material such as the graffito of a European ship can potentially add insight on the
Lucayan perspective of this encounter. For Lucayans, it seems, the most enduring symbol
representing Europeans was an approaching vessel, mute testimony of the nature of their
cultural contact.

      Entrada
The 2005 research season at the site of La Sufricaya in Peten, Guatemala offers new
archaeological and epigraphic evidence of the Early Classic period. A painted inscription sheds
new light on one of the most important episodes in Maya history, the Teotihuacan entrada. A
painted wall from the same structure displays mythological scenes in an Early Maya style with
implications on the use and function of palace rooms. The new evidence enables us to make a
hypothesis on the role of the local elite in the establishment of a new order in the Maya
Lowlands around AD 378.

[103] Beyond Style: Petrographic Analysis of Dalma Ceramics in Two Regions of Iran
Dalma ceramics have been identified in two widely separated regions, northwestern and central
Zagros. Stylistic characteristics show strong similarities between the two regions and
archaeologists have speculated that Dalma ceramics originated in northwestern Zagros and
were carried into central Zagros as a stylistic element intrusive into a local tradition. However,
this speculation and the possible mechanisms for its distributions cannot be substantiated
through stylistic analyses alone. Petrographic analysis gives insight into the technological style of
Dalma ceramics and the possible interactions between the two regions. This analysis is the first
step in a larger archaeometric study.

[51] Militarism and Competition over Strategic Locations at the Late Cajamarca Community
      of Yanaorco
A synthesis of recent fieldwork in the Cajamarca highlands points to an early LIP power vacuum
that was filled by increasing competition among regional polities in an increasingly militaristic
environment. This fieldwork indicates that there was indeed a shift in occupation emphasis to
defensible and often fortified locations. Excavation at Yanaorco at the head of the Jequetepeque
Valley provides a detailed view of a heavily fortified community that developed rapidly after the
fall of Wari influence in the Cajamarca Region. Work here indicates that occupation in this and
possibly other fortified villages was year round during much of this period.

Archaeologists now use the term "city" much more flexibly than they did twenty years ago, and
there is less debate about necessary attributes that define a city. But with looser characterization
of all large sites as cities, there is a tendency to presume the presence of the organizational traits
that once defined cities. One approach to understanding structural differences among large sites
is to pay close attention to both the domestic and political economies. This paper examines the
inter-relationship of domestic and political economy at Chan Chan, Peru.

This paper will present a range of case studies drawn from the British Neolithic period which will
further develop the debate surrounding the ritualisation of prehistoric extraction. Although not all
extraction sites were ritualised, a number of them clearly were and feature placed deposits,
curated off-site artefacts, burials and "non-functional" carved objects amongst their
assemblages. A contrast will be drawn between prominent mountain-top axe quarries and the
"hidden" flint mines. Inaccessibility of location and the recognisability of raw materials appear to
be key elements to understanding extraction site locations and the social importance of the
finished artefacts.

The Middle Horizon to Late Intermediate Period transition in the Chilean Atacama embodies, at
a small scale, many of the patterns seen throughout the Andes. Archaeological evidence shows
substantial population decrease and consolidation, and the construction of pukaras. At the
same time, there was a restructuring of local culture following the loss of prosperity and prestige
after the Middle Horizon. Data was collected from over 400 individuals from four cemeteries in
San Pedro de Atacama, demonstrating that the onset of the Late Intermediate was
accompanied by escalating violence, increased nutritional stress, and intensification of local
identity.

[85] Scaling Political Complexity in Terms of Work Forces and Labor Organization
In spite of efforts by the processual school archaeological contributions to the debate on the

negligible. Progress has been hindered by the lack of comprehensive factors of scale to relate
labor inputs to levels of complexity in a cross-cultural perspective. Digital geonomics, combined
with ethnohistorical observations and experimental replications, makes it possible to scale the
labor inputs a given population needs for the management of territory and resources. Case
studies from both Old and New World are presented to scrutinize their scaling by orders of
magnitude.

There are more areas of overlap as well as distinction between the Core Reduction Sequence
and Chaîne Opératoire methods of archaeological analysis than the current debate recognizes.
While methodological differences have been acknowledged, high-level theory differs to a greater
degree than is currently appreciated, partly due to the social practice of archaeology in different
contexts. This paper discusses the points at which the methods are not mutually exclusive or
redundant. The distinction between a decision hierarchy and a production hierarchy in artifact
design is used to elucidate how the practitioners of both methods can more successfully

everyday household activity, microscale social organization, community organization, identity
performance and Maya ideology. Though expressed vastly different from the politico-elite in
civic ceremonial centers, clearly, everyday identity and ideological expression by the household
Maya intersects with larger scale Maya society. Its manifestations are apparent in household
material remains, the use of space, architecture and ritual behavior.

Experimental rock art dating needs basic research into factors that affect dating. Wildfire damage
to a previously dated petroglyph site provided paired pre- and post-fire samples of rock coatings
to test the effects of fire on dating. The research also explored newer methods of dating not used
in the pre-fire dating. Methods of increasing the reliability of dating results included varnish
microlamination analysis, a dating method validated in blind tests, and cross-checking the results
with multiple dating methods. Results show that new dating methods have promise, and also that
fire can damage petroglyphs on a microscopic level and prevent dating.

Late Classic Maya society comprehensively, an analysis of male imagery is essential, especially
when one asks who made figurines for whom, and how they were used. Figurines from elite
buildings at Aguateca reflect rare assemblages that were in use or storage at the time of

Ohio's Gartner Village and Mound site (33Ro19) is known as a Fort Ancient Aspect type-site for

preparation, and consumption are representative of social differences, we now integrate faunal

relatively expensive and restrictable food, would be found primarily in elite residences or feasting
contexts.

complete cattle horn cores, as well as abundant contextual information. This permits a more
holistic approach that considers depositional context, varying treatments, morphological
attributes, and their very identity as animal body parts. We argue that the uses of horn cores
influence the ancient attitude toward cattle.

[30] Surveying and Excavating a Prehistoric Obsidian Workshop in Sardinia (Italy): Studying the
     Chaîne Opératoire
Survey and excavation has been conducted at the large obsidian workshop site of Sennixeddu,
adjacent to the SC geological source on Monte Arci. Artifacts from this source are found
throughout Sardinia, and also in Corsica, mainland Italy and southern France, dating as early
as the 6th millennium BC. Systematic survey, along with excavations in different areas, has
produced information on the organization and intensity of obsidian production during the
Neolithic period. More than 100,000 obsidian artifacts have been recovered and are being
studied and integrated with research on obsidian technology, trade and use, and other parts of
the chaìne opératoire.

[238] Excavations of a Mortuary Sample from the Caves Branch Rock Shelter
The 2005 excavations conducted by the Western Belize Regional Cave Project (WBRCP)
focused on the Caves Branch Rock Shelter. Analysis of the associated cultural material suggests
the site was used as a mortuary location by a rural agrarian population around the time of the
Protoclassic period. Based on the age and sex distribution it appears to contain a skeletal
sample not biased by cultural rules governing mortuary practices in urban centers. The CBRS
provides a unique opportunity to obtain bioanthropological data from an ancient Maya population
based on a more representative mortality sample.

[220] Emergent Landscapes of Intensification in Early Bronze Age Northern
       Mesopotamia
The model of early urban societies as states with powerful rulers and centralized economies
was based mostly on data from early excavations in ancient Mesopotamia, which focused on
elite contexts. This model has been found to fit poorly elsewhere, and now recent research in
northern Mesopotamia suggests that the centralized model might be inappropriate there as
well. This paper will review the landscape evidence for intensification around Early Bronze Age
cities in northeastern Syria. Archaeological and cuneiform data suggest that elites were
unconcerned with agricultural production beyond their own household needs, and that
intensification was an emergent phenomenon.

[234] A Community with Potters, or a Potters‟ Commune?: Classic Period Pottery Making at
       an Agrestic Center of Las Canoas
When excavations began in 2000, Las Canoas appeared to be a sub-regional administrative
center for elites from the Naco Valley to the north. Work demonstrated that Canoas‘ residents
produced a category of ceramics widely distributed along the Chamelecon and Cacaulapa rivers.
With time, extent and placement of production changed throughout the site; at the end, even the
Main Plaza, surrounded by monumental buildings, was just another place for craft working, not
an elite residential/ritual space. Thus, the entire site became a potters‘ community, not simply a
place where a few made ceramics while others had different or superior occupations.

In the 1930s, Ignacio Marquina initiated a long-term project involving the excavation of more than
8 km of tunnels to explore the Great Pyramid of Cholula. Information from these tunnels was
never published in detail nor is it available in archaeological archives. By cleaning exposed

have registered more than 2 km, allowing us to refine Marquina‘s plan of the first construction,
identify two unreported building phases, and date the early substructures. We present an

[141] Spatial and Social Patterning in Medieval Scandinavian Cemeteries
Archaeologists use the spatial arrangement of cemeteries to support inferences about social
structure in past populations. This poster presents evidence of the different, and often
conflicting, ways that horizontal and vertical aspects of social position have been represented in
medieval Scandinavian cemeteries. There is written and archaeological evidence that the
position of individual graves was influenced by age, sex, land ownership, home location within
the parish, and location of other family members; and that the relative importance of each of
these variables changed over time. The excavated cemeteries of Tirup (Denmark) and

Recent ethnoarchaeological investigations focus on reevaluating the role that objects and

which these actively constitute human-object relationships. An awareness of contemporary

Most usewear analyses of prehistoric assemblages are directed at one category of material

develop on tools made of bone, shell, coral or sherds. By studying the function of these different
tools, we can establish the technological and functional relationships between them, leading to a
reconstruct of toolkits. The choice of tool is very much a cultural one and is part and parcel of the
cultural tradition. This approach is in its infancy in the Caribbean area, but preliminary data
elucidating the possibilities will be presented.

domestic architecture and household assemblages are reflective of the processes that mark the
Paracas-Nasca transition and that they parallel the better-documented technological innovations
used to define Nasca society.

strengthen affiliation to a group and visualize social roles.

The Ancient Maya were a complex civilization known to employ extensive trade networks

The Northern Rio Grande has witnessed dramatic changes in the natural and cultural
landscape over the last 3000 years. The initial use of agriculture during the Late Archaic (1000
BC-AD 900) marked a shift from earlier settlement organizations. Circa AD 1150-1300
witnessed the expansion of agricultural populations into upland areas previously occupied by
hunter-gatherers. Eventually, nomadic Apache groups would move into the region to coexist
with the local agriculturalists during the post AD 1500s. This paper explores long-term changes
in stone tool production and procurement between foragers and agriculturalists, including the
effects of metal tool use on stone tool technology.

from Pueblo IV deposits at Chevelon. Did the artifact life histories of antique and late Pueblo
points differ significantly? Are notions of heirlooms, curation, and ritually-charged objects
appropriate for discussion of these items? What characteristics, other than perceived age,
could embue these items with social and ritual value? Depositional contexts, artifact
associations, raw material types, and patterns of surface damage to antique and Pueblo IV
points are compared to evaluate these issues.

to isolate specific aspects of identity (such as gender or class or race) without considering the
ways that social identities are holistically experienced. The concept, "overdetermination,"
foregrounds the ways that identities are irreducibly produced through ongoing references to
multiple aspects of social life. This point is demonstrated with examples from research at
Spanish-colonial and Overseas Chinese sites in California.

[163] Excavating Plazas
Excavations of geophysical anomalies confirmed a similar pattern of dense residential remains
razed and resurfaced with a gravel floor. This extensive surface was terraced into separate
areas, and a system of shallow conduits drained rainwater. Feasts and small scale rituals were
held in complex structures spread out within and on the periphery of this surface. This
investigation emphasizes the ritual nature of the core of Tiwanaku, the extent of reconstruction
during the apogee of the polity, and the feasibility of using geophysical surface and selective
excavation to investigate the spaces between monuments.

[242] Cultural Continuity versus Social Diversity in the Early and Middle Archaic Southeast
Our understanding of the early cultural chronology of Eastern North America is based largely on

of social groups from late Paleo-Indian through Late Archaic. Broad-scale application of this
conclusion is not without its problems, however, particularly when considering areas south of
the Piedmont, especially Florida. In this paper, we show that discrepancies in terminology,
technology, and radiocarbon ages in some areas of Southeast may actually indicate the
introduction of new groups of people which created greater social diversity earlier than is
usually considered.

[54] Oral Tradition is a Dead Thing
Despite its supernatural beings, and magical events, oral tradition is a dead thing for most
archaeologists. As commonly conceived there is no materiality in oral tradition. Oral tradition has
no action of its own; it is a thing of ideas that exists independently of people‘s activities. Oral
tradition needs some action to bring it life in the study of social change. History making is more
than speaking about migrations, farming, and fighting. We need to reconceptualize oral tradition
in terms human practices. Then we can ask what traces of oral traditioning characterize artifact
variability? What characteristics of these artifacts contribute to the performance of oral
traditioning? How do the practices of oral traditioning contribute to archaeological site formation
processes? As practice, oral traditioning contributes to the making of history (both remembering
and forgetting) not simply its inaccurate recording. It is the migrating, farming, and fighting. To
illustrate oral tradition as a living thing I explore of its role in the history of the pueblo cultures of
the American southwest.

decipher a structural grammar that informs the rules of representation, thereby giving greater

This presentation will focus on the first excavation and comparison of pre- and post-segregation
assemblages from South Africa's earliest diamond mining community. The project focuses on the

which the first apartheid-style segregated housing was introduced in Kimberley, South Africa.
According to archival sources, justification for segregated worker housing by elites and

empire's diamond mines. Census reports, however, indicate a large African population
permanently settled in and around the Diamond Fields. This paper examines this contradiction,

[185] Sampling Design and Inferential Bias in Archaeological Soil Chemistry: Cautionary
      Tales from Honduras
The ways and extent to which sampling design influences data collection and archaeological
inference is a constant concern for archaeologists. Yet, soil chemical studies have been less
willing to concede this problem and to explore potential solutions. This paper uses two case
studies from prehispanic Honduras to examine how interpretations of soil chemical patterns shift
when sampling density changes, and to show that systematic sampling, such as the use of lattice
grid matrices, can introduce systematic bias. These findings provide cautionary tales for spatial
studies aimed at using soil chemical data to infer activity patterns.

[104] What is a Vincennes Phase Assemblage?: Inferring Influences on the Mississippian
        Inhabitants of West Central Indiana and East Central Illinois
I will present results describing a series of diagnostic artifacts from some two dozen sites, in
Indiana and Illinois, with components attributed to the Vincennes Mississippian phase. This
survey is the first study to scrutinize, at regional and site levels, the artifactual foundation of
Vincennes‘ definition as an archaeological culture. Most of the materials in this survey came from
overlooked collections and have never been fully analyzed or published. I have combined data
from mound centers, towns, hamlets, and multiethnic habitations to provide a model for how
standards were caused and variability produced in Vincennes pottery, tools, and decorative
objects.

[97] Integrating Cultural Resource Preservation into the Military Mission
Texas Army National Guard‘s Cultural Resource program has integrated within the Military
Mission of the Texas Army National Guard, facilitating training opportunities while preserving
those cultural resources that are part of our Nation‘s rich heritage. Two factors have been critical
in establishing a sustainable program. First, identification and evaluation of cultural resources to
prevent unnecessary training restrictions while protecting significant resources via site protection
measures reduces conflict between the military mission and preservation regulations. Second,
and more importantly, encouraging a process where cultural resources are considered early in
the planning for training or construction activities avoids delays and adverse impacts.

[212] Taking Stock: Houses and Their Propertied Interests in the Colca Valley, Peru
Andean households made significant investments in their dwellings as markers of status and
identity, but wealth was rooted in agro-pastoral holdings beyond the confines of the house. We
examine the Andean ―house‖ as both a built structure and a resource-holding collectivity through
combined analysis of household dwellings and landholdings in the Colca valley. Qualitative and
metric analysis of over 600 late prehispanic houses charts how local elites projected their status
through an architectonic idiom. Declarations in colonial censuses from the descendents of these
archaeological households indicate significant differences in land wealth and large surplus
production capacity among elites.

[240] Modeling Mississippian as Non-State: A Narrowness of Vision?
A few scholars have treated Mississippian society, and particularly the polity centered on
Cahokia, as a state organization. Most Mississippianists dismiss the idea reflexively, using the
(admittedly broad) label of chiefdom instead. Aspects of medieval Europe, Southeast Asian
mandala organizations, and retainer burial phenomena worldwide suggest that a broader vision
provides intriguing comparisons. I suggest that our models of state and chiefdom do not fully
represent the variety and continuum of complex organization in past societies, and that
multidimensional models based on archaeological data must be developed for a more
appropriate evaluation of complexity in a worldwide perspective.

[91] Mixed Metaphors: Dynamic Modernities in Southeastern North America
Colonization of southeastern North America presented a series of challenges to the indigenous
peoples of the region. Chief among these impediments was a concerted effort to ―civilize‖
(modernize) these groups. This process was seen as an opportunity to liberate indigenous
peoples from the burdens of cultural tradition, to impart to them the gifts of Christianity and
capitalism, and ultimately to render them passive to Colonial agendas. Rather than simply
accommodating to a European modernity, however, Native Americans reacted dynamically to
these forces, creating their own syncretic modernities. This paper examines archaeological and
ethnohistorical evidence for these processes among the Creek peoples of the Southeast.

Results are presented from analysis of the data recovered from a full coverage systematic

periphery of the Maya lowlands. The research investigates the degree to which elites managed
intensive agricultural production on terraces during the Late-Terminal Classic period (AD 650-

need for agricultural intensification due to differences in the distribution and extent of soils good
for farming, the availability of water resources, and other ecological characteristics.

Multiple indicators of juvenile and adult health and diet are used to reconstruct living conditions
at the coastal sites of Marco Gonzalez and San Pedro, Belize. Although the small fishing village
of San Pedro appears to have experienced greater physiological stress than the larger trade
community of Marco Gonzalez, both sites supported more healthy populations than the majority
of inland Classic period sites. Although physiological stress may have been buffered by the
coastal location, there was a significant childhood disease load throughout their occupation. The
causes of inter-site differences may be either socio-economic or temporal.

Coastal shell middens from south Texas to north Florida date as early as 8000 BP. Most are
characterized by brackish-water clams and oysters, with large gastropods (conchs, whelks) in
more saline settings. Such aquatic food species show subsistence change/persistence over
millennia and the dynamism of coastal landforms. Some coastal fishing-hunting-gathering
adaptations continued into late prehistory despite the presence of agricultural chiefdoms inland.
Our data can be compared with those from coastal sites farther south (southern Florida,

Population theory engages the themes of evolution, technology, and environment, and can be

so the application of archaeological data to hunter-gatherer populations has been especially
difficult. To minimize inherent complications, analytical frameworks should be grounded in
demographic modeling that integrates the concepts of population size, density, growth, and
population pressure, as well as settlement based methodologies that address mobility, shifting
territories, and group size. This paper explores this proposal within the context of temperate
latitudes and Eastern Woodlands hunter-gatherers.

Temper analysis of plainware ceramics from Pueblo La Plata indicated that none of the pottery

sources. The petrographic work in conjunction with clay chemistry assays with an electron
microprobe showed that the pottery was imported from at least five production zones, suggesting
that pottery compositions can reveal patterns of economic dependency and interaction between
Perry Mesa and the surrounding territories.

The Northern Iroquoian practice of producing finely etched designs on bone tools is examined in

helped to shape and control the scale and form of people's association with the message and the
social action (e.g., reinforcement of awareness) that it was meant to induce. In this way, the
medium, independent of the story it accommodated, had its own intrinsic effects, which formed
part of its unique message. This paper will thus examine both the symbolism inherent in the
designs and the ideological roles in society of the animals from which the tools were produced.

Measuring retouch amount on stone tools has been helpful for understanding human

stone tools occurs as a result of use or curation. This assumption is evaluated using a stone tool
assemblage from western North America. It is shown that stone tool production activities may
create extensive amounts of retouch on stone tools that have never been used. As such, retouch

[126] Amending Cultural Heritage: Intentional Manipulation of Rock Art in Bonaire, Netherlands
       Antilles
Rock Art is a fragile and ambiguous written record. It affords us a conjectural chance to glimpse
into the creative collective and individual mind of previous cultures. Environmental conditions,
graffiti artists and poor cultural resource management practices put many sites at risk for
destruction. This paper will look at the progression of falsification, enhancement and destruction
of rock art in Bonaire, Netherlands Antilles, through the creation of an easily accessible database
compiling historical records, periodic modern archaeological assessments and testing with

[212] Preceramic Period Household Archaeology on the South-Central Andean Coast
Household archaeology deals with data from ancient domestic spaces. Household archaeology
is challenging when the spatial structure of archaeological sites is ambiguous, as is often the
case at the sites of mobile or very small groups of ancient people. This paper compares pre-
5000 BC and post 3000 BC domestic areas at Kilometer 4 in southern Peru. A shift from
ephemeral domestic structures to substantial terraces built on dense middens is seen throughout
the region. Intensive excavations at Kilometer 4 provide new insights into socioeconomic
changes that led to this shift, but they also highlight methodological challenges with wide ranging
ramifications.

[74] Close to Home? Pipestone Resource Utilization in the Midwest
Major pipestone quarries were located in several states in the Midwest. However, some sites
were used in both ancient and modern times while others, like the source of flint clay near St.
Louis, Missouri, were used for only a short time. Archaeometric analyses and experimental
archaeology support the workability of rock types such as Minnesota catlinite and Illinois
pipestone, but do not explain why sources were not used continuously throughout time. Other
factors, such as the locations of quarries in relationship to changing population centers and new
patterns of exchange are needed to explain resource utilization during prehistoric and historic
periods.

[121] "A Past No Longer Past:" Some Implications for a Symmetrical Archaeology
A symmetrical archaeology recharacterizes the world, not in terms of dualisms or oppositions,
but in terms of mixtures and entanglements. While it poses that we treat humans and things in
the same terms, both in our articulations and in our reflexive analyses of our own practices, a
symmetrical archaeology also accords the things of the past action now. This understanding
holds profound implications for a discipline which considers the past to be separate, distant and
distinct. This paper will offer an empirical case from the Greek Argolid and explore the
implications of a "past no longer past" for archaeology.

[109] Implications of the Central California Archaeobotanical Record for the Origins of Food
      Production
The 9,000-year interior central California archaeobotanical record shows multiple stages of plant
food intensification lacking in adjacent regions with near-identical plant resources. Intensification
occurred primarily where productive plant resources co-occur with rich inland fisheries. The most
abrupt change in the record, to intensive use of small seeds around 1,000 BP, corresponds to
shifts in artifact assemblages, exchange, and settlement, and appears to reflect a major
socioeconomic reorganization, perhaps from more centralized authority and redistribution to a
private goods economy. These findings have implications for models of agricultural origins.

[6] Zooarchaeological Datasets and Carnivore and White-tailed Deer Management in Central
    Texas
Applied zooarchaeology puts prehistoric datasets to work in conservation by adding time-depth
to management strategies. In Texas several top carnivores have been extirpated, which has
resulted in pest-level deer populations in areas. Differences in size of carnivores and deer
between prehistory and modernity are expected given that a lack of predation has increased
intraspecific competition for habitat among deer and has also potentially caused competitive
release among medium-size carnivores. In the absence of Native American hunters and large
carnivores, deer management can benefit from the perspective of prehistory by determining
policy that more accurately approximates prehistoric conditions.

Between 1513 and 1760, the indigenous societies of South Florida were subjected to

many elements of their traditional culture while simultaneously dooming themselves to eventual
destruction and exile. Synthetic review of available ethnohistorical and archaeological data
throughout this period provides important insights regarding the social geography of this unique

[42] Infrared Photography and Digital Enhancement of Prehistoric Rock Art in Karstic
     Portuguese Ribatejo
Prehistoric groups intensively utilized caves and rockshelters of the central Portuguese
limestone karst throughout the early Holocene. Preserved rock art is rare in the region,
however, because of extensive patina formation and destructive weathering resulting from
generally warm and humid paleoclimatic conditions coupled with local limestone geochemistry.
Possible painted surfaces at Abrigo de Vibora, likely of Chalcolithic age, were analyzed using
two types of infrared photography and high resolution digital image processing techniques. The
accepted painted panel at nearby Lapa dos Coelhos provided a methodological control.
Results, while mixed, indicate the potential of these techniques for documenting indistinct rock
art in temperate climate zones.

The Altai Mountains, Siberia, were an ecological refugium for animals and humans during cold

Denisova was mainly used by carnivores, particularly hyena and cave bear. Human occupation
was ephemeral, while carnivore activity seems to have been greater in the Upper Paleolithic

from the medieval period of Denmark (1050-1536 AD). I examine differences in diet through
time, by social class (peasant, elite and monastic populations), and by location (urban and rural).
Isotope ratios show significant temporal differences, as the period 1300-1375 AD exhibited the
greatest reliance on terrestrial animals and plants. Elites and monks enjoyed a diet with
significantly more terrestrial meat and marine products than did those of the peasant class.

rural counterparts.

[100] Slingstones and the Missile Firing Flexible Hand Sling -- The Forgotten Projectile
      Weapon of the Pacific and the Americas
The missile firing flexible hand sling, of David vs Goliath fame, was the premier projectile weapon
of the pre-European Pacific Islanders and Andean Cultures of South America. Bipointed stone
and clay sling missiles were manufactured throughout Oceania and it appears from ca 8000-
3000 BP in western North America and the Caribbean. These data have been all but forgotten or
ignored by archaeologists. Study of the humble slingstone has the potential to contribute
significantly towards resolution of many questions relative to the decision processes of human
societies, such as "Tregear's Conundrum" and pre-European Pacific Islands contacts with the
Americas.

[131] The Site of Parcela Escolar, Q.Roo
During the 2005 field season, the sits of Pamela Escolar was recorded for the first time using a
tape and compass. Additionally, one plaza test pit was excavated in an elevated area between
residential structures. One of the major goals of the research was to gain a better understanding
of the spatial and temporal relationships of Parcela Escolar to the other sites in the CRAS study
area, especially to the adjacent site of Sacalaca. A relationship to, or some degree of
dependence, upon Sacalaca can be proposed based upon the layout and makeup of Parcela
Escolar and the periods during which it was occupied. Parcela Escolar, which is situated on the
periphery of Sacalaca and bears a resemblance to the northeastern group of Sacalaca, may
actually be an extension of the site itself, which is now heavily affected by modern settlement.

[143] Hornfels Artifact Sourcing by Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) in the
      Karoo Region of South Africa
Hornfels was a major source of prehistoric toolstone across the South African central plateau
where 1,000+ hornfels quarries with evidence of use since Acheulean times are recorded for
the Seacow River valley alone. We sampled 39 outcrops within ~8-km radius of Haaskraal
Rockshelter (LSA) and matched elemental composition of ~300 artifacts. Some 46% of artifacts
were direct matches; 51% of endscrapers, 42% of flakes. Few artifacts (15% maximum) appear
derived from quarries outside the sampling radius. With due caution, we conclude that hornfels
sourcing by INAA is viable, and could be applied to regional sites of all ages.

[137] Pit Cooking and Intensification in the American Southwest and Pacific Northwest
This research examines ethnographic patterning in pit cooking across the American West to
explore and quantify intensification. In arid environments, forager dependence on plant foods is
found to increase pit hearth size. In riverine environments, forager dependence on aquatic foods
is found to increase pit hearth size. This pattern highlights the difference between intensification
within a narrow niche of limited resources versus a broader productive niche: the finding bears
directly upon mode of forager intensification using food production versus specialization in bulk
processing of wild resources.

usually associated with large-scale migrations in Eastern and Southern Africa. These Holocene
cultural processes were not a single ―expansion‖ but the outcome of regional dynamics of
immigration, diffusion, invention, and admixture, in which interactions amongst diverse
communities practicing different but complementary subsistence strategies played a crucial
role. Our paper will highlight the evolution of ethnic mosaics in Western Kenya over the last
2000 years.

[85] Materialist Approaches in Archaeology
Archaeological explanation has alternated between largely untested, so-called "scientific"
models, either broadly ecological in orientation (processual), or essentially descriptive (so-
called Darwinian approaches), and post-processual approaches, rejecting the rigid confines of
processualism, but often particularlistic and speculative. Based upon materials from my work in
South India and Central Asia (Tajikistan), I will argue that archaeological explanation can
be/must be materialist, historical, and comparative, dealing with both the economic/political
aspects of society, as well as those normally deemed non-materialist in nature.

[89] Spatial and Temporal Variability of Fish Use at the Southern End of South America
The archaeological record of Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego (southern South America) points
out the existence of spatial and temporal variability in fish exploitation. In the Magellan-Fuegian
archipelago, an intensification of the human use of fish was developed during the mid-and late-
Holocene. The archaeological assemblages of this area show that a wide variety of fishing
strategies were in place. This situation differed from what happened in the Atlantic coasts,
where the available data suggest that the use of fish was a supplemental activity. Ecological
and cultural factors related to this pattern are discussed.

[200] Elementos Arqueológicos "Mayas" en la Huasteca
Durante 2004, dentro del Proyecto para la Determinación Geográfica del área cultural Huasteca,
localizamos en Hidalgo un elemento, que por el momento, sólo hemos podido comparar con las
torres emblema que hay en la península de Yucatán, a más de 1,500 kilómetros de distancia.
Por la cerámica colectada pensamos que este asentamiento debió construirse alrededor del año
1000 es decir que ¿es entonces cuando llegan los grupos de habla maya a la región? Con
mayores investigaciones en el sitio, podremos responder a esta pregunta.

[152] Multi-scalar Perspectives on the Courses and Consequences of Agricultural Land Use
      along the Arid Osmore Coast of Southern Peru
Agrarian landscapes represent a critical yet dynamic point of articulation between humans and
their environment. As a product of co-evolving cultural and natural processes, analyses of
agricultural landscapes require explicit concepts of scale, both spatial and temporal, to
understand the complex relationships among variables like cultural practice, environment,
population, and technology. This paper examines issues of scale as they relate to long-term
courses of agricultural land use along the far south coast of Peru over the past millennium. The
scales of analysis employed here are explicitly nested, providing a more powerful explanation of
historically contingent and agriculturally related human behavior.

[27] Carving Out a Hill: The Creation of Public and Private Spaces at Chalchihuites Sites in the
     Valley of Guandiana, Durango, Mexico
The state of Durango, Mexico occupies a key geographical space between Mesoamerica and
northwest Mexico/ the U.S. Southwest. In the valley of Guadiana the pre-Hispanic inhabitants
opted to appropriate hills for the construction of their homes, the locus of their daily activities and
the edification of ceremonial spaces. The complex network of terraces, paths, and walls created
public and private spaces at the site. In this paper, we will discuss the particulartities of inhabiting
uphill spaces for the Chalchihuites people of the valley of Guadiana.

[2] Threatened Mountains, Troubled Blackfeet: Documenting Traditional Use History of the
    Badger-Two Medicine District, Montana
The Blackfeet Tribe is a leading voice in the public rejection of oil and gas exploration proposals
along the Rocky Mountain Front, a portion of which we arguably ceded in 1896. This "ceded
strip," now partially included in a Traditional Cultural District managed by the US Forest Service,
encompasses the watersheds of Badger and Birch Creeks and the South Fork of Two Medicine
River—a "Holy Land" containing numerous locales associated with origin traditions, religious
practices, and everyday activities. Collaborative research stimulated by the reopening of drilling
leases revealed previously undocumented cultural connections between the Blackfeet and the
watersheds.

[69] Network Centrality, Political Authority, and Prehispanic Settlement Systems in the Jama
     Valley, Coastal Ecuador
Previous analyses of settlement pattern data from the Jama Valley, coastal Ecuador, have
emphasized examination of rank-size graphs for characterizing population distributions and
social interaction. While productive, this approach was deemed incomplete due to its reliance on
site size as the sole indicator of site importance at the expense of other possible indicators such
as civic-ceremonial mound-building and settlement system centrality. This paper explores social
network analysis as a means of capturing these other indicators and shedding new light on intra-
valley settlement dynamics and political centralization in Jama-Coaque chiefdom formations
between AD 400-1200.

[216] Transforming Cultures, Enduring Identities: Change and Persistence among the Isthmus
       Zapotec
Archaeology confirms what a modern observer of traditional Isthmus Zapotec culture may
conclude -- that this populous indigenous society has a propensity for incorporating new goods
and technologies imported from the outside world and redefined as local cultural markers. The
colonial period material record for the Tehuantepec region similarly reflects wide-ranging
cultural changes, many developed through an active engagement with the new market
economy. Ethnohistorical data outline specific structures that enabled the social reproduction of
distinctive meanings and values associated with these introduced forms, while frequent
confrontations with Spaniards fostered an oppositional identity preserved actively in narrative
history.

[218] Scales of Complexity – Complexity of Scales: Reliability Analysis of Mortuary Remains as
       Nuanced Measure of Social Complexity
Social scientists strive to understand the social tapestry. Archaeologists, plagued by data
deficiencies, can use established methods for insights into the nuanced complexities of ancient
social interaction and hierarchy. We use reliability analysis to examine 683 burials from our
work in the Copan Valley, Honduras, and then generalize its application as a mortuary analysis
tool to other Mesoamerican and global societies. More than a methodological exercise, we
additionally show how many models of social complexity utilizing mortuary remains that partition
data into discrete clusters lose information, produce misleading results, and fail to portray what
anthropologists know about social complexity.

[163] Puma Iconography in Tiwanaku Ceramics: A Stylistic Analysis of Artifacts from the
       French Scientific Mission
Reinterpretation of previously unpublished photos taken of artifacts excavated by the French
Scientific Mission at Tiwanaku has yielded insight into the development of stylistic change in
puma iconography within the Titicaca basin. The oscillation between abstract and naturalistic
features during the same relative period indicates the coexistence of diverse regional styles used
within Tiwanaku, as well as different conceptions of the puma itself. By comparing artifacts from
the French expedition with contemporary examples from both the Tiwanaku and Katari Valleys,
this study will attempt to reconstruct the context, and perhaps, part of the underlying significance,
of these previously unstudied artifacts.

[69] Make Ready the Feast: Communal Food Preparation and the Rise of Complexity
     in Late Formative Bolivia
Rituals of commensalism have a long history in the Andes and often play a central role in
theories about the rise of social complexity. In the southern Titicaca Basin, considerable
sociopolitical transformations were taking place during the Late Formative. At the site of
Khonkho Wankane, in Bolivia's Desaguadero valley, one compound, originally identified as
residential, may have actually had a more ceremonial function related to the production of food
for large-scale feasting events. This paper will review theories related to the importance of
feasting in Andean development and will consider how this site adds to our understanding of
the phenomenon.

[83] The Archaeology of Equality
Traditionally archaeologists have addressed the question of status and elites. This paper
examines the nature of equality and how it is expressed in the archaeological record. Four
models of equality are appraised based upon different theoretical underpinnings. They are the
equal treatment model (equal treatment for equals and differential treatment for unequals), the
equality of outcome model, the equality of opportunity model, and the equality of resource
model. Examples from the Upper Paleolithic archaeological record are considered from each of
these perspectives.

The aim of this contribution is to inform the audience about the current state of the debate about
the agricultural dispersals in Europe and the emergence of the Neolithic. Principal explanations
are critically reviewed in the light of recent archaeological and genetic evidence. A case is
made for a new synthesis based on revaluation of both archaeological cultures and human
biological, including genetic, information.
