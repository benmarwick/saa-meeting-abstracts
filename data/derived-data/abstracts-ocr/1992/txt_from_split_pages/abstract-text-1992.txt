[211] STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF PLEISTOCENE ARCHAEOFAUNAS FROM CENTRAL

EUROPE.

Teeth and bones of non-human mammals from the open site of Milovice (Czechoslovakia, 26,000
BP} and Vindija Cave (Yugoslavia 80,000 BP) have well preserved collagen. Stable carbon and nitrogen
isotope analysis of collagen provided results consistent with those on modern European mammal
communities and late Upper Pleistocene archaeofaunas. Camivores and herbivores can be distin-
guished with nitrogen isotopes. If Middle and Upper Paleolithic hominids in Europe also have well
preserved collagen, it should be possible to use isotopic analysis to reconstruct their positions in their
foodwebs.

[113] SOUTHERN NORTHWEST COAST ELITE CONTROL OF THE HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY.

The economic roles of the Northwest Coast’s chiefly elite are ethnographically well described for
the 19th century, but there is little relevant archaeological data for the contact and pre-contact
periods. Recent excavations of a large plank house dating between ca AD 1400-1800 in NW Oregon
show clear differences between low and high status ends of the house in food processing, storage, and

access to and use of exotic and native metals [iron and copper). These results suggest much stronger

elite control of this household’s economy than predicted from available ethnohistoric sources.

[404] SNAKES AND LADDERS: TECHNOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION AND THE STRUCTURE
OF INFERENCE IN LITHIC ANALYSIS.

The relationship between lithic data and technological organization is complex. While the theoreti-
cal aspects of technological organization have evolved substantially, consideration of the structure of
inference in lithic technology remains underdeveloped. This paper uses Folsom assemblage case
studies to argue that the linkage between lithic data and organizational theory requires a greater focus
on behavior, The sequential nature of stone tool manufacture, use, and discard provides a unique
dimension to behavioral reconstruction. In addition, behavioral inferences must be placed within the
context of situational decisions in order to understand the conditions under which organizational
strategies are responding.

MODELS FROM THE MULTISCALAR PERSPECTIVE.

Diachronic examination of the southeastern Mississippian archaeological record has proceeded
employing a number of scalar frameworks, including analyses at the intrasite, site, locality, regional,
and interregional levels. Research employing multiple scales of analysis going beyond the site or
locality level is comparatively infrequent, yet has proven to be remarkably productive in advancing
and evaluating explanatory models for the emergence, expansion, interaction, and collapse of complex
societies within the region. Examples of multiscalar analyses employing archaeological, paleobiologi-

approaches suggest profitable directions for future research.

(707] FIELD PARAMETERS USED TO RECOGNIZE RECENT HISTORICAL ALLUVIUM ON

THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY.

Federal agencies are responsible for locating and managing significant historic properties on their
lands, a difficult task when natural and human-induced forces have masked or degraded cultural
deposits and landforms. During the 1980s the Corps of Engineers contracted numerous archaeological
investigations. Geomorphological assessments revealed that original (before ca 1830) pre-EuroAment-

historical alluvium. This paper describes field indicators used to distinguish historical deposits from
native soils, and addresses implications for research design, site interpretation, and effective manage-

Migration is not a chaotic or unstructured aspect of human behavior; on the contrary, migration
operates in predictable and highly patterned ways. The prehistoric expansion of Algonquian-speakers
in the Eastern Woodlands, a linguistically attested phenomenon that must have proceeded partially
through migration, can be better understood if we apply a model of migration that can establish the
parameters within which archaeologists and linguists should be working. The model, published earlier

American public archaeology is hard to explain to the “public” we allegedly serve, Since the federal/
state system of oversight and review depends largely on consensus and consultation rather than
absolutes, our expectations and guidelines to implement them are often so general and “flexible” that
they become meaningless. Understandings of acceptable practice vary widely when applied to specific
archaeological projects or programs. If this is true, why and for whom should we have archaeological
standards, and at what level are they best developed and implemented to serve our often conflicting
needs.

[411] THE INFLUENCE OF HOUSEHOLD DECISION MAKING STRATEGIES ON
SETTLEMENT PATTERNS.

Most models that have been developed to explain differences in settlement densities (nucleated vs
dispersed) have relied upon arguments concerning the political complexity of the cultures in question.
These often include cultural biases that consider wet tropics as less suited for the development of
complex societies than arid river valleys. A model is proposed to account for differences in settlement
densities among several Mesoamerican sites. The model suggests that variation in settlement densi-
ties is the result of different risk reducing strategies that are adopted by households within diverse
communities.

[404] RISK AND THE ORGANIZATION OF FLAKED STONE TOOL TECHNOLOGY.

Recent lithic analyses identify many factors which affect flaked stone technology, but lack a unified
theory. This paper expands recent discussions of risk as the basis for such a theory. We begin by
defining risk, emphasizing two distinct components of existing definitions: probabilities of problems
occurring and the costs of such occurrences. Second, we argue that technological behavior can be seen
as a means of reducing these probabilities in the face of unacceptable costs. Third, we consider how
risk affects flaked stone technology along a continuum from raw material procurement through tool
production and use. Finally, we illustrate our perspective with an archaeological example.

serves as a basis for reconstructing the seasons of habitation of selected sites. Identifying the settle-
ment patterns practiced by hunter-gatherers and early farmers from about 15 k years to 5 k years BP
enables us to suggest a series of alternative hypotheses for the emergence of farming and later of

[110] RESIDENTIAL UNIT SIZE AND COMPOSITION PRIOR TO NUCLEATION IN THE

PREHISTORIC RIO GRANDE.

The prehistory of the northem Rio Grande is less understood when contrasted with other areas of
the Southwest. While more is known about the large pueblos of the region, discussion of the basic
residential units prior to aggregation is underrepresented in the literature. The purpose of this paper
is to examine variation in household function, size, and spatial distribution across time in the
region. This information from the northern Rio Grande is contrasted with prehistoric data from more
intensively investigated areas in the northern Southwest, and patterning of residential unit size and
composition is discussed in light of these larger regional trends.

[311] TECHNOLOGICAL VARIABILITY DURING THE PLEISTOCENE/HOLOCENE
BOUNDARY IN THE PORTUGUESE ESTREMADURA.

This study is focused on technological variability during the Tardi and Postglacial times (12,000 to
8500 BP) in the Rio Maior area (Portuguese Estremadura), The relationship between typology and
technology, presently undefined for any European Upper Paleolithic group, 1s examined through a
detailed study and reconstruction of reduction strategies. Also, ‘desired end products” are examined
through the relationships between raw material selection, blank production, and tool blank selection.
The results suggest that there are significant differences in technology during this period where factors
such as water and raw material sources are not likely to account for the lithic diversity.

In recent years, ethnoarchaeology has received currency among professional archaeologists. This

7 method of gaining insight into prehistory by means of ethnographic studies has been practiced by

paleoethnobotanists even longer. Beginning with Melvin Gilmore and continuing to the present time,

asking the experts—that is, native peoples—has had an impact on our thinking about plant utilization

in the past. In this paper, I briefly discuss some aspects of ethnographic studies jointly undertaken by

this author with Richard Yarnell in the Canadian subarctic over a 27 year period.

[311] THE PRODUCTION OF IRON IN LATE IRON AGE EUROPE.

The production of iron in the La Tene C and D periods of European prehistory was of great
importance to the cultures of western and central Europe. Abundant artifactual evidence, including
iron slags, ores, and the characteristic Burgenland style furnaces, provides a useful base for the study
of the scale and organization of this iron production. However, until May 1991 no Burgenland furnace
had been constructed and fired in a full production smelt. The results of the May 1991 production
smelt provide significant corroborative data that allow for more detailed models of large-scale iron
production to be suggested.

[404] RISK AND COST IN JAPANESE MICROCORE TECHNOLOGY.

At the end of the Pleistocene, mobile hunting groups throughout Japan used wedge-shaped cores to
produce microblades. Techniques involved in making and using these cores have been reconstructed
in minute detail, and their age and distribution are well documented. To address the role cores and
microblades played in terminal Paleolithic economy, this paper uses event tree analysis to identify
patterns of risk in the production of microblade cores at three terminal Japanese Paleolithic sites.
This analysis amplifies typological descriptions of the cores and shows that microcore production
clearly was carried out in the context of broader stone-use strategies. Microcores clearly were produced

Teaching archaeology in the classroom benefits both the students and the teacher. [t affords the
epportunity to blend subjects across the curriculum under one theme, The school day no longer
assumes the segmented regiment of individual unrelated subjects. Archaeology can take the students

can foster new understanding and growth, which can lead into a desire to preserve the past for the

1310] A PALEOETHNOBOTANICAL ANALYSIS OF FOUR UPLAND SITES IN NORTH
CENTRAL GEORGIA.

Although Mississippian settlements are typically associated with riverine environments, over 300
“homestead” sites are known in the Piedmont uplands of the Oconee watershed in north central
Georgia. Most of these sites date to the last two phases of the Lamar period, Dyar and Bell (AD 1520-
1660), during which dramatic regional demographic growth has been postulated. Paleoethnobotanical
analysis of four upland sites reveals a diachronic shift in plant exploitation strategy, from the targeting
of a limited number of highly favored taxa, to the utilization of an extensive range of species. This
pattern reflects increasing economic stress, supporting the hypothesized population expansion.

a thick deposit of ground sloth (Mylodon darwinii) dung, formed between 13,500 and 10,000 BP. The
latter deposit covers an area of well over 400 square meters. A wide variety of cultural and natural

HERDING SYSTEMS.

Colonial New England and Chesapeake agriculture are compared to show how colonists developed .
distinctive herding systems that ultimately affected primary uses for cattle. Analysis of documents
and archaeological kill-off patterns show that in New England a system of well-developed fields and
herd management practices produced cattle for both beef and dairy products. In contrast, agriculture
in the Chesapeake focused on the cash crop tobacco. Cattle were left to fend for themselves on
undeveloped lands, and when combined with the warm climate, the effect was that dairying remained
unimportant.

[509] LATE WOODLAND MORTUARY VARIABILITY IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN

VIRGINIA.

Much variability in the modes of human interment and kinds of associated grave goods has been
noted in the Late Woodland (AD 800-1600) archaeological record of central and western Virginia.
During this period, secondary interments in accretional burial mounds, primary inhumations in
villages and cemeteries, and even interments in platform mounds are noted in different regions. Grave
goods include exotic items, possibly indicating status differentiation. This variability in Virginia 1s —
summarized by region and is compared to mortuary patterns of nearby contemporaneous Mississip-

- Long-term research in the Sand Canyon locality in southwestern Colorado has investigated commu-
nity organization including scale, differentiation, mobility, and integration. Integral to this study is
the identification and interpretation of public spaces that may have served the community as a whole.
Three such features have been identified at Sand Canyon Pueblo: a plaza; a central, D-shaped, bi-
walled structure; and a great kiva. Initial excavations have shown that all of these structures are
contemporary with the rest of the site. Labor investment and spatial analysis indicates that they
probably were built by and served social groups larger than a household.

[113] ARE MACAWS VALID INDICATORS OF SOUTHWESTERN REGIONAL TRADE?

Prehistoric macaw remains recovered from sites across the Southwest have been considered proof
of direct southwestern-Mesoamerican trade, based on their identification as native to southern Mex-
ico. A review of the identification methodology indicates macaws cannot —be identified on a species
level by skeletal remains alone. How does this affect our concepts of southwestern regional trade?
The known volume of macaw trade does not support the concept of a “Greater Southwest” trading
area. It is possible that direct southwestern-Mesoamerican exchange did not occur. The possibility of
3 native macaw population within the American Southwest also is discussed.

j110] DATING ADAMANA BROWN WARE: IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ARCHAIC TO

BASKETMAKER TRANSITION IN NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA.

The pivotal transition from the nomadic lifestyle of Archaic hunters and gatherers to the sedentary
village life of the early agriculturalists has engendered fertile models of culture change. These models
invoke causes such as population expansion, technological innovation or borrowing, and social interac-
tion, and suggest gradual or abrupt, linear or punctuated processes. But the substantiation or refine-
ment of these models requires fine-grained spatial information and precise chronometric data. Recent
research at three Basketmaker [I sites, including the first chronometric determinations for Adamana

Most arguments regarding fish use by Lapita peoples of the southwest Pacific rely on limited direct
evidence from fish remains. Comparison of fish assemblages from Lapita contexts in the Mussau
islands, Papua New Guinea, with other assemblages from Melanesia and western Polynesia reveals
significant variability in taxonomic representation. Some assemblages are dominated by herbivores
jscarids, acanthurids), while others are dominated by remains of carnivorous fishes (e.g., lethrinids,
serranids). Although differences in analytic and archaeological recovery practices, as well as natural
abundances, may explain some of this variation, differences in caprure techniques used (netting/hook
and line) better explain the taxonomic variation.

site was used as a forager residence during the Middle Archaic and as both a collector and forager
residence during the Late Archaic.

[513] ESKIMOS, COMMERCIAL WHALING, AND THE CAPITALIST LABOR PROCESS IN
LATE 19TH/EARLY 20TH CENTURY NORTH ALASKA: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF
KELLY'S WHALING STATION, 1891-1892,

John Kelly established his commercial shore whaling station and hired 80 eskimo employees 1n
1891-1892, within five years of the initial use of Eskimos as wage laborers in the western Arctic
commercial whaling industry. In the course of those five years Yankee whaler/traders combined their
moral and material resources with those of Christian and federal interests to undermine traditional
Eskimo social relations of production and gain control over the labor of virtually every Eskimo in
north Alaska. The present paper links archaeological data from Kelly's whaling station with documen-
tary data to understand the sociomaterial circumstances of the creation of an Eskimo industrial labor
force.

[605] PROBLEMS ARISING FROM THE IROQUOIAN PRESENCE IN THE SAINT LAWRENCE
ESTUARY.

During the Late Woodland period, the Iroquoians living in the Quebec City area developed a
distinctive adaptive pattem combining horticulture and the exploitation of marine-based resources.
Long-distance movements of large segments of communities in the Saint Lawrence Estuary are unique
among Iroquoians. What criteria, then, can identify these northern farmers who evolved alongside
Algonquian groups, while they were hunting seals and whales at the periphery of their homeland? We
consider the implications of the in situ development theory for these Lroquoians, using ethnohistorical
analogy, settlement patterns, ceramic attributes, lithic sourcing, mollusc exploitation, and NAA of
clays and lithics.

|603] PROBLEMS OF SCALE IN THE EMERGENCE OF COMPLEXITY.

One of the characteristics of emerging complexity documented in both the ethnographic and
archaeological records is the increased scale of sociopolitical units, both in terms of demography and
spatial extent. This gives rise to the question as to how far, and under what circumstances, increases
of scale were causes or consequences of emerging complexity. In turn, this directs attention to the
preoccupation of archaeologists with system-wide variables at both micro-(households, communities}
and macro-(regions, polities) scales. This paper considers problems of scale using archaeological data
from prehistoric Europe.

[414] PROCESS AND STRUCTURE IN AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY.

The histories of modern historical disciplines can be framed within interacting polarities emanating
from Enlightenment vs Romantic modes of thought. In American archaeology, these oppositions have

often been articulated as emphases on the process of change or on synchronic interconnections. For
example, Willey and Sabloff’s classification of American archaeology reflects alternating ascendancies
of processual and structural research strategies. The difference between Taylor's conjunctive approach
and the New Archaeology, as well as the post-processual critique of the latter, conform to this pattern.
. This paper briefly explores American archaeology’s past, present, and future in terms of the process/
structure dyad.

Major syntheses of Hudson Valley prehistory have ignored archaeological sites investigated by Mary

of the 45 sites tested by Butler, the Goat Island Rockshelter (Dutchess County, New York}, demon-
strates the importance of analyzing previously excavated collections. The rockshelter was used
sporadically over the past 6000 years, with the most substantial occupation during the Middle

and a minimum vessel count, this study challenges the efficacy of regional ceramic typologies.

Stable isotope analysis of bone gelatin from eight humans, recovered from the Cedar Mesa area,
indicates that both Basketmaker [I and Pueblo people in that area obtained about 79%, or more, of
their protein from C4 plants, suggesting that maize was extremely important in their diet. The Pueblo
people appear to have used perhaps 5% more C4 species than Basketmaker II people. Both were
approximately 40 to 60% higher than the C4 plant intake of an Archaic individual from the same
area.

The prehistoric population of the Tonto Basin developed an intricate subsistence system involving
intensive farming and the exploitation of a variety of desert plants. Several approaches are used to
gain a better understanding of this system. Modern distribution of usable plants is mapped using
vegetation survey techniques, and the prehistoric distribution of cultivars and wild plant resources is
reconstructed from flotation, pollen, and phytolith analyses of samples from archaeological contexts.
These data are integrated with a series of physical and chemical tests of soils associated with agricul-

PAINTING TRADITION AT TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO.

The mural paintings and the stuccoed and painted ceramics from Teotihuacan have long been
viewed as a single painting tradition, produced by the same artisans. This paper challenges this
assumption through stylistic and technical analysis of the painted programs on 120 stuccoed vessels.
The alternate view suggests that artisans related to ceramic workshops may have produced the
paintings, specifically those artisans that worked in the plano-relief decorative technique (post-fired
scrape excision). The temporal relationship of stuccoed and painted ceramics to other pottery styles
also is examined to suggest some economic implications for the development of this painting tradition.

This paper challenges the traditional view that Northwest Coast houses and households increased
dramatically in size with the emergence of cultural complexity. Evidence from the northern coast
suggests little change in household size over a 1500-2000 year period, during which time ranked
societies are thought to have evolved. The labor requirements of large-scale production associated
with cultural complexity may have been accomplished in these communities by relatively small
households working together as units under the organizational leadership of a village chief, a system
quite different from that which existed during the early historic period.

Brandon is a Middle Saxon (ca AD 650-900) settlement located in eastern England. Ten seasons of
excavation at Brandon have produced a rich and diverse faunal collection of over 150,000 fragments.
When compared to the faunal assemblage from the nearby early Saxon site of West Stow, the Brandon
assemblage shows an increased reliance on adult male sheep. The Brandon harvest profiles, when
combined with morphological, paleobotanical, and artifactual evidence, indicate an increasing use of
sheep for wool production in the Middle Saxon period. This shift toward wool production can plausibly
be related to the rapid development of urbanism and trade in the Middle Saxon period.

[603] POLITICAL INTEGRATION IN THE PROTOHISTORIC RIO GRANDE VALLEY:

IMPLICATIONS OF AGGREGATION FOR MOBILE HORTICULTURALISTS.

Many Puebloan sites dating to the period AD 1450-1680 are unusually large for the prehistoric
American Southwest. Recent archaeological research in the northern Rio Grande Valley indicates
that only portions of the seemingly extensive villages were occupied at any given time. Blocks of
rooms were built in places that were favorable for settlement based on the presence of water sources
and available land. Roomblocks were periodically abandoned and new ones built nearby. Over time
this created the impression of huge villages governed by egalitarian means. The implications of this
serial construction for theories about prehistoric Southwest political organization are discussed.

[705] INTEGRATING SMALL SITE METHODS IN REGIONAL RESEARCH: AN EXAMPLE
FROM THE HUSDON VALLEY.

Two recent initiatives, the Upper Hudson Survey and Planning Study and the Small Sites Methods
Project, have identified the need for an approach to discovering and studying small or low density
archaeological sites in eastern New York state. Methods developed for a variety of cultural resource
management projects address the need for small sites research. Several examples suggest changes in
approaches to field work, and reevaluate assumptions about the comprehensiveness of surveys and
the nature of archaeological data in the Northeast.

[507] STATE FORMATION IN PREHISTORIC CRETE.

Palaces were the first sites extensively excavated during the archaeological exploration of prehistoric
Crete. The traditional approach focuses on the construction of the palaces in the early Middle Bronze
Age as the archaeologically recorded event representative of state formation. This study, however,
shows that supporting evidence for organizational complexity, such as survey and mortuary data,
indicates that state formation in Crete proceeded throughout the Middle Bronze Age. As the develop-
ment of religious rituals and secondary economic centers led to increased social and economic
integration, the palaces became the centers of small states.

[302] THE OHIO HOPEWELL SETTLEMENT PATTERN PROBLEM IN HISTORICAL

PERSPECTIVE.

Until recently, research on Middle Woodland settlement pattern has been nearly non-existent in
Ohio. An exception is Olaf Prufer’s work in the 1960s, although even his sample was small, and
systematic analysis was limited to a single site. Within the last decade the data base has increased
dramatically, and it is now possible to begin to explore Prufer’s proposition that Ohio Hopewell
populations lived in dispersed farmsteads centered upon vacant ceremonial centers. This paper exam-
ines historical constraints on current attempts to make sense of recent settlement archaeology and
identifies the elements of a regional-scale strategy for testing the Prufer model.

[412] PREHISTORIC SITE DISTRIBUTIONS AND DENSITY AROUND CAPE COD'S KETTLE
HOLE PONDS.

Prior to completion of a number of recent CRM surveys, inland sections of Cape Cod were under-
represented in New England's archaeological record. Kettle hole ponds are one characteristic feature
of the varied glacial topography of this pennisula, These ponds are generally considered to have a high
prehistoric archaeological sensitivity. Recent investigations have found that prehistoric land use and
occupation near these ponds varied greatly. Evidence of continuous occupation is found near some
ponds, while others appear to have been occupied sporadically for hunting/gathering. This paper
synthesizes recent survey findings and offers preliminary explanations on variability in use of this
environmental! setting.

Saladoid ceramic similanties with other Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico. Survey data indicate that

Antigua, like several other Leeward Islands, witnessed marked population growth after Saladoid

times. Evidence gathered to date does not support a mode! of increased stress on marine resources,

although settlement distributions may reflect expansion to poorer agricultural zones. Human occupa:
tion after AD 1000 has not been firmly documented.

[512] ALGONQUIAN AND IROQUOIAN COMPETITION IN THE NORTHEAST AFTER 1500

Archaic populations of the Northeast probably spoke languages related to Lroquoian-Siouan-Cad-
doan. Algonquians intruded around 1400 BC, moving down the Missouri from the Columbia Plateau
and occupying the upper Illinois and mid-Ohio drainages. From these Midwestern centers, their social
and cultural ideas were spread, by means of Red Ocher/Glacial Kame ceremonialsm, to groups along
Lake Michigan, the Scioto, and Lake Champlain. Middlesex, based at Lake Champlain, stimulated
development of Eastern Algonquian languages. Meadowood was an imitative response by Northern
lroquoians.

these developments. Much recently excavated material related to fabric manufacture, including
preserved fragments of cloth and tools associated with spinning and weaving, now allows the textile
technology to be similarly assessed. Intra-site spatial patterning indicates some specific activity
areas within settlements. The correlation of the apparent production diversity with variation in
environmental, regional, and chronological factors is examined.

[509] THE DEMISE OF THE PREHISTORIC MONONGAHELA IN SOUTHWESTERN

PENNSYLVANIA: IS THERE EVIDENCE FOR LONG-TERM STRESS?

The causes for the sudden disappearance of the late prehistoric Monongahela in southwestern
Pennsylvania continue to be debated. One of the avenues for addressing the issue involves the analysis
of the ecofactual remains from these sites with respect to documenting long-term environmental
and/or food resource stress. The search for evidence of biological stress begins with the large vertebrate
assemblage from the Howarth-Nelson locus (36Fa40) and focuses on significant changes in species
composition, age distribution patterns, and butchering/processing techniques during late prehistoric
times. The second line of evidence is drawn from the human pathology profiles and stress indicators,
as well as demographic patterns at the Howarth-Nelson locus and three contemporaneous sites in
the area.

Demography is an important causal variable in many anthropological models of culture change,
but the difficulty of obtaining precise population measures from archaeological data limits our ability
to make those models testable. Population trends are being measured on two scales in the Tonto
Basin. On a regional scale, a large-site data base has been compiled that allows consideration of large-
scale population movements oF changes over time. On the local scale, architectural and artitact
data are being used as separate, but complementary sources for evaluating smaller-scale patterns of

population change. Methodological issues and preliminary results are considered in this paper.

|410] ARTIFACT AND PARTICLE SIZE ANALYSIS IN ASSESSING ARTIFACT TRANSPORT.
Sediment and lithic samples were recovered at 10cm intervals from block excavations at an alluvial/
colluvial interface and a colluvial fan. Dry sieving of sediment samples produced a clast variability
curve which was compared with flake abundance. Results suggest that these two variables may
be helpful in assessing depositional environments as well as the potential for artifact transport.

Corresponding peaks of clast size and flake abundance suggest that flake variability is due to artifact

transport. On the other hand, peaks in the flake curve compared with sediment uniformity are thought
to indicate concentration due to occupation rather than clast transport.

coherent spatial layouts. Scale and circumstance of these house clusters may be part of the origins of
later Anasazi villages.

Village societies. Tool assemblages, pottery technology, and lithic resource use indicate a gradual
development of a Plains Village adaptation. Macrobotanical remains support some previous supposi-
tions on the importance of corn horticulture. However, bison were not a significant food source for
these early villagers. Dry conditions around AD 1250-1300 may have resulted in an increased bison
population in the eastern prairies of Oklahoma allowing for selection of increased bison hunting
rather than intensified horticulture.

Cultural evolutionary approaches have emphasized broad regularities in the development of com-

to “chiefdoms” and “states” of all sorts. Subsuming many cases under a single explanation is intellectu-
ally satisfying, but comparative studies show important qualitative differences not only between
chiefdoms and states but also between members of each class. Successful explanations of complex
societies, then, must account not only for the broadest general similarities but also for substantial
variation. Some approaches to social complexity are much more promising than others when consid-
ered in this light.

[710] SEDIMENT ANALYSIS AND PALEOCLIMATE, DANGER CAVE, UTAH.

An analysis of sediments from a sediment column at Danger Cave, Utah, was used to determine
paleoclimate and occupational change during the last 10,000 years. The analysis included grain size
and shape, percent carbonate and organic carbon, pH, mineralogy, and microscopic examination of
sediment fractions. Five sediment sources were identified: lacustrine, rock spall, eolian, slope wash,
and biogenic. A paleoclimatic model, constructed from the analysis data, suggests more intensive
human occupation during warm/dry intervals, probably related to the availability of nearby lake
margin resources as determined by fluctuations in the Lake Bonneville shoreline.

The archaeological record of Cape Cod includes both large multicomponent Woodland sites situated
‘ at the major estuaries, and much smaller, contemporaneous sites often located more than 1/4 mile
from the immediate coast. While the functional relationship between these two types of sites is not
always clear, it can be demonstrated that population aggregation and periodic dispersal were signifi-

record of the outer Cape, it is argued that aggregation and dispersal were complementary elements of

a conditional sedentism which manifested all of those demographic, economic, social, political, and |

territorial attributes traditionally associated with sedentism.

and living out, and their association with free blacks, all of which affected the post-bellum residential
patterns of urban blacks. For a southern town, Knoxville, Tennessee, was unique in its politics,
economy, and number of black residents. Through a study of documents and archaeology, this paper
attempts to determine how Knoxville’s distinct character influenced the patterns of slavery and its
aftermath within its boundaries.

[306] SHELL ORNAMENT MANUFACTURE IN EJUTLA: IMPLICATIONS FOR COASTAL-
HIGHLAND INTERACTION.

The emergence of marine shell ornament production in Ejutla indicates an important shift in the
nature of interactions between the Pacific Coast and the Central Valleys of Oaxaca during the
Terminal Formative-Early Classic period. At this time, a diversity of Pacific shell species was trans-
ported to Ejutla where they were reduced through a range of technologies from whole shells to beads,
pendants, and bracelets. Implications from these findings are discussed in the context of Monte Alban

. expansionism and the importance of coastal-highland relations in ancient Mesoamerica.

[304] STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN HISTORIC ZUNI ARCHITECTURE AND SOCIETY.

An archaeological explanation of social change must be predicated on (1) objective demonstration

| of measurable differences in the archaeological record, and (2) a theoretical description of the causes
and processes that produced that change in material culture. Techniques of graph analysis are used
to measure change in the structure of historic Zuni village plans in terms of connectivity and
permeability. Changes in architecture are related to social change using a “social logic of space”
model reliant on Durkheimian notions of integration and segregation. Historical and ethnographic
data are used to independently evaluate the results.

In Tierra del Fuego, midden sites on the Beagle Channel share several common features—site

superimposed layers distinguished by coloring, texture, and faunal composition. These traditionally
have been interpreted as different occupations but could also correspond to activities arising from the
same event. A model based on artifact reassemblage, debitage analysis, and invertebrate faunal
composition is used to define these deposition units and 1s useful for understanding localities with

Contemporary accounts are largely mute on what caused the seemingly rapid transformation of the
Neutral Iroquoians of southern Ontario from a dynamic cultura] enuty to one relegated to historical
obscurity. The Iroquoian conquest between AD 1647 and 1651 terminated this distinctive culture;
the cumulative effects of geographical location, environment, and human events that had earlier
molded Neutral culture also were ultimately responsible for its demise. Archaeologically derived
trends in material culture, settlement patterning, inter-regional interaction, and subsistence pursuits
are evaluated in light of cultural evolution, foreign influences (native and European), for a society
living in a transitional biotic zone during a period of climatic deterioration.

The Frobisher voyages (1576-78) provide an unexplored venue for interdisciplinary studies of early
European-Inuit contact. This paper reviews historical records in the light of recent archaeological
research at both the Frobisher site and Inuit sites in Frobisher Bay. Data suggest a contact sequence
of (1) initial exchange and barter, (2) mutual hostility and hostage taking, and (3) post-contact scaveng-
ing and utilization. The Frobisher voyages supplied East Baffin Inuit with European materials for

nearly three hundred years until European whaling began in Davis Strait in the late 19th century.

Hence the dominant effect of Frobisher contact was post-contact and utilitarian. This pattern is

In 1761, four Baltimore merchants erected a small ironworks, Antietam Furnace, in the newly

development during the latter half of the 18th century, The central premise of this paper is that the
unusual size and configuration of the smelting complex at Antietam represents a tentative response
to a challenging frontier environment. Its demise represents part of the transition from a preindustrial
emphasis on local markets to one involving a larger market economy.

cornucopia of easily available nuts, the Eastern Woodlands forest may have provided only limited
yields without human management. in the Archaic period, the management of localized stands,

mobility. By favoring increased sedentism and the opening of the forest canopy, nut tree management
would have added impetus to the creation of domestilocalities and the exploitation of native weed

evidence that any of the sites had served as agricultural communities, and it seems probable that
intermittent/cyclical occupation and abandonment was occurring, perhaps as a function of ceremonial

{202} REBURIAL IN PRACTICE: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE CASE-BY-CASE

APPROACH.

Archaeologists (and many Indians) promoted a case-by-case approach to reburial laws, or careful
consideration of the unique qualities and circumstances of each case. This was thought necessary if
we truly wanted to respect the wishes of tribes or nations. Now that legislation is largely in place, it
is useful to see how the idea of case-by-case has been put into practice. It appears we have replaced
our old methods of operation with new sets of rules that have trouble accommodating the case-by-
case approach. The potential consequences of this situation is examined.

PRELIMINARY COMPARISON.
Initial survey and examination of Tiwanaku settlement patterns in the Azapa Valley of northern
| Chile suggest altiplano state suzerainty over ethnically distinct indigenous peoples. This differs
radically from the colonization and full incorporation into the Tiwanaku state system that previous
work has demonstrated for Peru’s Moquegua Valley between AD 500 and 1000. Settlement pattern,
material culture, and domestic and monumental architecture are used to contrast the patterns of
regional diversity and state hegemony that prevailed in both areas.

[209] TEST-PIT HEAVEN: WHEN THE SAMPLE REPRESENTS THE POPULATION.

Numerous projects use test-pitting to help understand the chronology and function of sites and to

reconstruct the settlement system of a region. At Copan, Honduras, an empirical check of this
methodology is possible for the rural area. Six sites were tested and then later completely excavated,

allowing for an analysis from sample to population. In most cases, the test-pitting data are highly

representative of site function and chronology, thus supporting the reconstruction of the Late Classic

Copan settlement system from the test-pit survey.

[705] PROCESSUALISM, POST-PROCESSUALISM, AND CULTURAL RESOURCE

MANAGEMENT IN NEW ENGLAND.

Cultural resource management and processual archaeology have dominated the study of New
England's prehistory since the 1970s. In becoming the dominant approach to the study of prehistory,
the processual approach to cultural resource management systematically excluded from consideration
questions of meaning, ideology, history, and individual action in the past of Native Americans. This
situation persists at a time in which processualist archaeology is under increasing criticism in
academic circles. The consequences of this situation are considered, and specific strategies are sug-

gested to make cultural resource management studies more amenable to emerging ‘post-processual”’
alternatives to the study of prehistory.

, , ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
[1] SOCIETIES IN ECLIPSE: PITTSBURGH AND ENVIRONS AT THE DAWN OF
COLONIZATION.

Between AD 1450 and 1700, Native American populations throughout the Eastern Woodlands
experienced massive upheavals. Regional depopulation, the development of pan-tribal organizations,
shifting political alliances, and the emergence of new economic priorities resulted. While European
colonization of the Northeast and Southwest played a tremendous role in disrupting traditional Native
American societies, populations in interior areas removed from direct European contact experienced
disruption at the hands of their Indian neighbors. This symposium focuses on these changes, emphasiz-
ing the social dynamics within and between various parts of the eastern woodlands at the dawn of
history.

[101] SECTION 106: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.

Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act requires that federal agencies take into
account the effects of their undertakings on properties eligible for, or listed on, the Register and to
afford the Advisory Council a reasonable opportunity to comment with regard to a project. In the last
twenty-five years the Section 106 review process has become a formal procedure for deciding the fate
of archaeological and traditional cultural properties. This symposium addresses common standards
that are practiced for federally mandated investigations and examines whether the implementation
of the 106 process results in justifiable research.

[102] SOCIETIES IN ECLIPSE: EASTERN NORTH AMERICA AT THE DAWN OF
COLONIZATION.

Between AD 1450 and 1700, Native American populations throughout the Eastern Woodlands
experienced massive upheavals. Regional depopulation, the development of pan-tribal organizations,
shifting political alliances, and the emergence of new economic priorities resulted. While European
colonization of the Northeast and Southwest played a tremendous role in disrupting traditional Native
American societies, populations in interior areas removed from direct European contact experienced
disruption at the hands of their Indian neighbors. This symposium focuses on these changes, emphasiz-

[103] INTRASITE SPATIAL PATTERNING IN THE PALEOLITHIC OLD WORLD.

Although a large number of Old World Paleolithic sites have been examined for spatial patterns
and structure over the last 20 years, the methods used and the results achieved are extremely diverse
and have never been synthesized adequately. This symposium brings together those working with a
variety of approaches and analytic methods in a manner that allows comparisons to be made between
different sites and regions. Such an examination of the range of variability in intrasite spatial pattern-
ing as it changes with time and region is a necessary step in building our understanding of how
Paleolithic peoples used and organized their spatial landscape.

[104] PLANTATIONS ON THE PERIPHERY: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SMALL
SLAVEHOLDING SITES.

Archaeological research regarding slavery has focused primarily on large plantations of the Lowland
or Tidewater South. This research has provided a critical comparative base for the analysis of slave
material culture and social relations within the plantation hierarchy. However, the archaeology of
slavery in the South rarely has addressed sites outside the Tidewater and Lowland areas. This sympo-
sium explores the archaeological record of non-plantation slave sites or small plantations located in
the peripheral areas of the South.

[105] HOUSEHOLD ARCHAEOLOGY IN SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA: THE CEREN SITE, EL
SALVADOR.

The eruption of Laguna Caldera volcano rapidly buried the Classic period Cerén site, preserving
organic and inorganic artifacts in situ along with structures, gardens, and milpas. Households, as co-
residential adaptive groups, coordinate functions of production, sharing and redistribution, reproduc-
tion, and transmission. Each household built multiple structures for particular purposes, including
domiciles, storehouses, and kitchens. Other buildings had public or specialized functions. The sophisti-
cation of adobe residential architecture in southern Mesoamerica, with large platforms, cornices,
lintels, and even a dome and a window, was hitherto unsuspected. Multidisciplinary research includes
volcanology, geophysics, archaeology, botany, and conservation.

Geological and pedological studies at Paleoindian sites show a sedimentological and pedological

pattern which reoccurs in the southern Appalachians. Evidently, the Pleistocene-Holocene strati-

graphic boundary is marked by channel-related sands overlying eroded B-horizon paleosols. In the

clearest cases, post-Clovis lanceolate points are contained within the first pulse of Holocene alluvium,

suggesting that deposition did not begin until sometime during the 11th millennium BP.

[307] SHIFTING PARADIGMS AND SUBSISTENCE CHANGE IN OCEANIA: A HISTORICAL
CRITIQUE.

This paper provides a historical and critical review of studies of subsistence change in Oceania. We
show that the changing goals of archaeological research are reflected not only in methodological
concerns, but in the kinds of conclusions reached. Early researchers were preoccupied with origins
and migrations, and showed little interest in subsistence. Later cultural evolutionary assumptions
led others to see “neolithic revolutions” in many island cases. Recent years have witnessed a growing
sophistication with issues of recovery, quantification, and comparability. New research and re-analy-
sis challenge some conventional models of subsistence change.

[204] THE SHENKS FERRY TRADITION: LATE WOODLAND SETTLEMENT CHANGE IN
SOUTHEAST PENNSYLVANIA.

The Shenks Ferry tradition dates to AD 1250-1550. Based upon an analysis of the Shenks Ferry
settlement record, three broad historical trends emerge: (1) a decrease in the size of the inhabited
territories, not sustaining territories; (2) an increase in the size of villages; and (3) a decrease in village
numbers. These settlement changes exhibit clear parallels to cultural systems reported for other parts
of mid-latitude eastern North America at this time. The rationale for these settlement trends within
a larger framework of environmental, demographic, and other change is discussed.

[310] A CRITICAL EVALUATION OF THE SIXTEENTH-CENTURY SPREAD OF DISEASE IN
THE INTERIOR SOUTHEAST.

Anthropologists have argued that following contact, pandemics spread rapidly throughout the
southeastern United States, causing a massive collapse of Native American populations. Recently,
however, there has been a growing dissatisfaction with this model, and a number of historians and
anthropologists have begun to raise questions concerning its validity. A critical examination of the
historical, bio-archaeological, and epidemiological data reveals that there is little evidence to support
3 model of disease-induced depopulation, and that competing models taking into account political
cycling, trade, and mussionization offer better explanations for the collapse of the southeastern
chiefdoms.

FROM WEST CENTRAL TEXAS.

Excavations at Site 42RN169 revealed evidence of a Late Prehistoric bison processing station.
Rapid burial during flooding episodes limited post-depositional disturbance and left in situ artifacts
associated with well defined activity areas and features. Remains of bison, deer, and smaller mammals
were recovered. Among features recorded were three peg features of vertical bison ribs, including a

[615] BEGINNINGS OF FEDERAL AID TO ARCHAEOLOGY.

It was coincidence in American history that brought archaeology, Works Progress Administration

The mission of TVA was to construct a series of approximately fifty hydroelectric dams on the
Tennessee River and its tributaries. In 1934 it was mandated that archaeological sites be explored
before waters were impounded. Because the WPA bureaucratic superstructure was 50 undeveloped
our initial relations were very good.

[402] INTERREGIONAL PATTERNS OF LAND USE AND PLANT MANAGEMENT IN NATIVE
NORTH AMERICA.

Regional perspectives have dominated the landscape of North American archaeology and hence
paleoethnobotanical studies. Preliminary cross-regional comparison of land use strategies results in
the emergence of several patterns. A select number of plant families were the source of most native
crops in temperate North America. Later, although approximately 1000 years apart, corn and beans
diffused separately, but apparently simultaneously, into the Great Basin and eastern United States.
By the time of European contact, periodic burning in discrete patches was practiced extensively by
Native Americans to manage plant and animal resources. This interregional perspective is essential
to understanding plant/people interactions throughout North America.

DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE IN ILLINOIS.

The Middle Woodland-Mississippian interval (200 BC-AD 1400) in Illinois was marked by dramatic
changes in the design of domestic architecture. For example, Middle Woodland structures were built
at surface level, with circular, oval, or rectangular floor plans, and floor areas ranging to above 100
square meters. By the Emergent Mississippian, most structures were semisubterranean, rectangular,
with floor areas less than 10 square meters. Changes in design are examined using data on approxi-
mately 700 structures. Key factors underlying these changes include household size, scheduling and
diversity of subsistence tasks, and costs related to structure construction, maintenance, and winter
heating.

A poorly documented aspect of late prehistoric settlement on the Pajarito Plateau of New Mexico

This conversion suggests that elements of the former cultural landscape were perceived as resources

IMPLICATIONS FOR AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF EUROPEAN/AMERINDIAN CONTACT.

In the Upper Xingu region of southeastern Amazonia, direct sustained Amerindian/European con-

Xinguano societies since that time reveals that overall regional depopulation was characterized by
punctuated and often isolated demographic “shocks’’ among individual villages, often followed by
periods of recovery. Indigenous responses to these isolated periods of stress, typically invisible archaeo-
logically, were a preeminent factor of change as these societies adapted to decreased numbers and
an ever expanding western frontier. General patterns of contact-related change among Amerindian
populations are discussed based on these findings.

late Pueblo III period (AD 1200-1275) in the Mesa Verde region. Describing and interpreting these
changes requires more precise chronological control than is presently possible with dating based on
pottery types. However, stylistic variation within Pueblo III pottery types has been recognized. This
variation is the basis of a method developed to date ceramic assemblages using attribute analysis.
The technique focuses on seven attributes of rim morphology and painted designs and can be used to

date assemblages with a resolution of thirty to forty years.

[209] FORMATIVE PERIOD SOCIOPOLITICAL EVOLUTION IN SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA:
EVIDENCE FROM RECENT WORK IN CENTRAL HONDURAS.

Two seasons of survey and excavation in the Cataguana and Oloman valleys, department of Yoro,
Honduras, have revealed a significant Formative period occupation, including a Late Formative ball-
court. Drawing on relevant research in Honduras, El Salvador, and Guatemala, this paper discusses
the implications of the Yoro material for current models explaining sociopolitical development in
southern Mesoamerica during this period. Among the issues considered are the nature and importance
of interaction between non-Maya Honduran societies and the Maya, and the role of the ballgame in
the florescence of complex political organization during the Formative period.

[609] A CERAMIC PERSPECTIVE ON ETHNIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE AT GORDION,
1500-200 BC.

From 1500-200 BC a series of ethnic and political groups were dominant at Gordion. Identifying
and interpreting their possible impacts on the local ceramic tradition depends on broad based recon-
struction of ceramic technology and organization of production. The effects of ethnic, economic, or
political change may vary in both type and degree among components of an assemblage. At each
transitional point, the development of the utilitarian, special purpose, and fine wares is distinctively
different at Gordion.

that such stress can cause evolving cultural complexity, but that the strength of the causal linkages

(203) THE LIMITS OF EVOLUTIONARY THEORY AS APPLIED TO ARCHAEOLOGY.

For some 30 years archaeology has struggled to establish itself as the science of humans, albeit with
limited success. In part, this is due to a typological mindset that is incompatible with the process of
enodern science. Evolutionary theory offers some hope of escaping this straightjacket, though there
has been far too much trumpeting of selectionist theory without an honest appraisal of the theory's
limits. Proponents of the theory must first decide what aspects of the archaeological record are
amenable to a selectionist approach before any appreciable progress will be realized.

[403] LATE PREHISTORIC TOWNS IN THE SOUTHEAST.

An observation for the late prehistoric period in the Southeast is that mega-regional centers (great
towns) occurred early (prior to AD 1400), and smaller centers typified the region after this time. This
scenario derives from a consideration of site area and volume of mound construction. To go beyond
this “devolutionary” sequence, other characteristics of the southeastern centers are examined. Com-
monalities evident throughout the sequence are used to provide a skeletal model for these centers.
With this foundation, changes in the use of integrative mechanisms, resident population, and social
differentiation are employed to derive a dynamic characterization of late prehistoric regional centers.

Examples from zooarchaeological studies of southeastern chiefdoms are used to explore faunal
correlates of elite rank. While some “elite” patterns can be identified archaeologically, other factors
may obscure clear rank-related patterning. For instance, because social ranking evolves within a
context of intensified public ritual that includes ceremonial feasting, interpreting faunal refuse in
elite archaeological contexts to be representative only of elite diets may be spurious; recognition of
dietary differences related to elite membership requires that the refuse of elite domestic contexts be
distinguished from that derived from ritual feasting contexts.

[203] ADAPTATIONIST AND SELECTIONIST EXPLANATION,

This paper addresses what constitutes acceptable processual explanation in archaeology. Borrowing
from previous studies, we draw the important distinctions between materially based and ideationally
based explanation. Interestingly, the dominant form of processual explanation—adaptationism—is
strongly ideational owing to its Lamarkian assumptions which locate cause in human motivation.
This means that attempts to evaluate any purported explanation will be incomplete since such
evaluations cannot be lodged exclusively in the material record. By contrast, selectionist explanation
is intended to be materially based and thus empirically sufficient. Drawing on archaeological exam-
ples, we contrast these forms of processual explanation in seeking approproiate ways that archacolo-
gists may explain the cultural evolutionary record.

learning about prehistoric Indian culture, students are exposed to one another's cultural backgrounds.
This presentation elaborates on this unique program and offers an example of the hands-on activities
that are integral to Cahokia’s educational programs.

[510] ANEMIA, DIET, DISEASE, AND SEDENTISM: HEMATOLOGY OF NOMADIC AND
SEDENTARY MODERN HUNTER-GATHERERS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR
ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS OF PAST DIETS AND DISEASE.

The prevalence and kind of anemia present among modern Kalahari nomadic and sedentary hunter-
gatherers with adequate diets is compared to sedentary former Kalahari hunter-gatherers with inade-
quate diets. Sedentism, in contrast to diet, is found to be the cause of high levels of anemia and
morbidity at the sedentary communities. The causes of the anemia of chronic disease are discussed
in light of past and modern shifts to sedentism and aggregation. It is suggested that dietary interpreta-
tions based on skeletal populations exhibiting high frequencies of porotic hyperostosis resulting from
anemia need to be rethought.

[312] BEYOND THE OBVIOUS: NON-CARIBOU REMAINS FROM AN ESKIMO CARIBOU
HUNTING CAMP.

Faunal data are one of several informational sources for the interpretation of archaeological remains.
Utilizing the faunal remains from the Lorenz Overlook site (a northeast Alaskan protohistoric Eskimo
caribou hunting camp or village), this paper demonstrates the significance of the non-caribou remains
in detailing daily living patterns, providing corroborative evidence for the season(s) of occupation,
and providing additional evidence for the behavior of provisioning an external group (American

‘“ whalers) that is hypothesized for this group, based on historical and artifact analyses. The non-caribou
remains represent approximately 10% of the assemblage, yet provide substantial contextual data
otherwise unavailable.

[705] INTEGRATING PUBLIC EDUCATION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN
CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: A CASE STUDY.

The crisis of archaeological site destruction by private development is rampant throughout the
northeastern United States. This paper presents an approach to combat such a problem. A three-year
series of public field school and workshop sessions held at the Lambert Farm site in Rhode Island
provides a successful model for cultural resource management of an important yet endangered prehis-
toric site. This educational program resulted in the recovery of significant information and the
heightening of public awareness of both archaeology and the site destruction crisis in a way that can
contribute towards the protection of material remains from similarly threatened sites.

[105] THE ARCHITECTURE OF CEREN.

Excavations at Cerén, El Salvador, have exposed ten buildings preserved in almost pristine condition
through burial by volcanic ash. Included are domiciles, storehouses, a kitchen, and other special
purpose structures. Such earthen domestic architecture is relatively unknown. This paper describes
and analyzes architectural forms and features (roofs, wall, cornices, benches, etc), materials (adobe,
wood, thatch, stone}, construction techniques and procedures, and relational layout at Cerén. It adds

{708] IMPORTED METALS IN EARLY SWAHILI SITES ON THE KENYAN COAST.

Early Swahili sites on the East African coast date from the 8th through the 10th centuries AD and
typically consist of stone- or coral-built elite residences and mosques in a town of humbler mud-
walled dwellings. Metallographic study of metal objects from the elite residences suggests that most
were made outside Africa, and probably in India or the Arabian Peninsula. These results, together
with the evidence of the ceramic and glass assemblages, suggest occupation by a wealthy immigrant
trading elite.

(704) WALLS, WARFARE, AND AGRICULTURE IN THE LATE CLASSIC PETEXBATUN,
GUATEMALA.

While the agricultural techniques utilized by the ancient Maya are now coming into focus, our
understanding of the intracommunity land-holding practices and social boundaries which structure
all systems of land use is still very rudimentary. Recent research in the Petexbatun region of Guate-

| mala has revealed a system of well preserved walls and terraces dating to the 8th and 9th centuries,
reflecting high levels of community competition and intensive agricultural production. Partitioning
of the Petexbatun settlement system is discussed in terms of agricultural intensification and warfare

is briefly outlined.

[310] ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION OF LAKE HOLE MORTUARY CAVE.

The excavation of 24 m’ of looter-disturbed deposits from a mortuary cave in northeastern Tennes-
see has yielded abundant human skeletal remains, large and diverse faunal and floral samples, burial
artifacts, and torches. This sample represents at least 95% of the original archaeological deposit in

. this cave. Although the deposits had been disturbed, the large sample size and the excellent organic
preservation permit the definition of a previously unknown ceramic ware and use of a cave strictly
as a mortuary facility. The results of the faunal, lithic, ceramic, sedimentological, bioarchaeological,
and archaeobotanical analyses are presented in this report.

At any point in time, landscapes consist of both contemporary features and features from earlier

periods. This paper examines architectural ruins in the rural landscape of the 19th century Chesa-
peake. At least some of these ruins served symbolic functions, not unlike the ruins portrayed in
contemporary Romantic literature and painting. Archaeological and documentary evidence indicate
that these ruins represented a sort of popular history within local plantation communities, These
ruins may have been used to justify a traditional but failing economic system and to reinforce the
social power of the few members who controlled land, labor, and politics in this oligarchic society.

[208] HUNTER-GATHERER CERAMICS: A VIEW FROM EASTERN NEVADA.

The presence of ceramic industries among Great Basin hunter-gatherers conflicts with current

document the extent of late prehistoric Shoshone ceramic industries. These data are drawn together
in order to explore the complexity of these industries, including vessel and non-vessel forms, ceramic
constituents, manufacturing techniques, design elements, use, and temporal placement. This Shos-
hone assemblage also is compared cross-culturally with other hunter-gatherer ceramic traditions.

nity has 25 room blocks and such Chaco-inspired features as a two-story great house, roads, and an

enormous, unroofed great kiva. I argue that recognition of this phenomenon requires reformulation

of current conceptions of post-Chacoan, Anasazi social integration.

[515] OF TIME AND THE RIVER: AN “ABSOLUTE SERIATION” APPROACH TO CERAMIC
CHRONOMETRY IN THE JAMES RIVER VALLEY OF VIRGINIA.

Precise chronological control is critical for processual archaeological research, regardless of the
theoretical framework structuring the research. Braun (1985) argues that a fine-grained, replicable
chronology can be constructed by analyzing temporal trends in vessel wall thickness and temper size.
Over time, as dependence on starchy seeds, particularly maize, increased, potters created vessels with
thinner walls to enhance thermal conductivity, This research tests Braun's model by analyzing
temporal trends in ceramics from the James River Valley of Virginia that span the transition from the
broad-spectrum Middle Woodland adaptation to the horticultural societies of the contact period
(ca AD 200-1600).

[504] CERAMICS AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF 19TH CENTURY AMERICAN URBAN

Recent workshops on the status of urban archaeology have revealed a dissatisfaction with the
current direction of urban archaeological research. This research seems to take place in a vacuum,
with no consideration or understanding of the society that is being examined. Thus, the results of
this research are often trivial and uniformative. This is most evident in the analyses of ceramic
assemblages from urban sites. If placed within their appropriate cultural context, however, the ceramic
assemblages can be used to study change in American households, both in cities and rural areas.

Understanding site taphonomy is fundamental to interpretation of artifact industry. Taphonomic
processes can be analyzed directly through accurate and comprehensive study of artifact orientations.

“The integrated electronic recording system at Combe Capelle Bas in Dordogne, France, enabled
analysis of stone artifact orientations on a scale never before accomplished. Circular distribution
statistics, used in the geophysical sciences, are employed to compare orientation tendency and
variation among the stratigraphic levels, assisting in the interpretation of the nature of the stone tool
assemblages and the resolution of the excavation’s objective.

[608] THE SIGNIFICANCE OF VARIABILITY IN THE PRODUCTION SEQUENCES OF EARLY

Analysis of the operational sequences of Early Upper Paleolithic bone and antler projectile points
indicates a high degree of temporal variability in both design and production techniques. The raw
material used, the method of manufacture, and the morphology of the resultant projectile point, while
standardized at any given time, changed throughout the Aurignacian and Gravettian. The various
technological approaches are indicative of the societal context in which the objects were constructed |
as well as that in which they were put to use.

Over the past 20 years many western European Upper Paleolithic sites have been examined for
internal spatial patterning. These analyses suggest three basic modes of internal organization. Hearth
focused sites are often large, complex sites with many features and distinctive global and local
patterning. Areal focused sites are often scatters of artifacts, and/or occur with severe natural con-
straints. Structure focused sites frequently show no clear indications of hearths and are free of
‘natural’constraints. They are frequently highly patterned around architectural structures, however.

During the past 40 years, pastes and aplastics of domestic and imported wares and ceramic artifacts
associated with the Classic Teotihuacan period {AD 50-750) in Central Mexico have been analyzed
by binocular and petrographic microscopy, in the main, to discern locales of production. Technological
studies (Shepard, Sotomayor, Abascal, Kolb, etc) normally were reported individually and indepen-
dently in the literature. In this paper, the results of completed (Alpha and Beta “Thin Orange,”
Granular, Copoid, and San Martin Orange) and ongoing investigations (Polished Monochrome, Bur-
nished Monochrome, Red-on-Buff, Coarse Matte, and Fine Matte) are standardized to better compare

Various aspects of craft specialization have been addressed by archaeologists, but few have focused

raw material sources may have played in the rise of lithic production specialists. Replication studies
suggest that access to large quantities of a suitable raw material was essential to the acquisition and
maintenance of a technical skill like the production of large bifaces. The validity of this hypothesis
is evaluated by reviewing prehistoric biface production in the Central Mississippi Valley.

boundaries were diffuse. Major transformations, but not necessarily internal regional growth and
collapse, were temporally coordinated, which in the absence of exogenous forces implies a limited

Subsistence-settlement systems of non-Middle Mississippian late prehistoric groups of the Eastern
Woodlands have traditionally been viewed as adaptations to environments marginal for maize agncul-

Recent research suggests stronger connections with later Anasazi than were previously recognized,
as well as clear differences. Further, a wide range of dates and variation within the Basketmaker II
period are now recognized. Papers present recent findings on a wide variety of adaptational and
organizational themes.

In recent years world-systems theory has become a widely employed, if hotly debated, perspective
for exploring social evolution and the economic, poliucal, and social ramifications of inter-societal
interaction, Although these kinds of interactions often are discussed by archaeologists, world-systems
theory has not been extensively used in archaeological research, particularly in the Americas, This
symposium introduces world-systems theory to Americanist archaeologists, provides several exam-
ples of research conducted within a world-system perspective, and attempts to kindle some debate
about the utility of world-systems theory in contemporary archaeological research.

{207] MID-THIRD MILLENNIUM SECONDARY STATE FORMATION IN NORTHERN

[216] RETHINKING THE QUINCENTENNIAL: CONSEQUENCES FOR PAST AND PRESENT.

The work of North American archaeologists has been crucial in shaping popular as well as academic
understandings of how contact and colonial expansion has transformed the Americas since 1492; not
surprisingly, a great many of them have been drawn into the events and enterprises designed to mark
the occasion of the Columbian Quincentennial. In recognition of this, the SAA sponsored three
extended symposia, in 1988, 1989, and 1990, on “Columbian Consequences’’—now published by the
Smithsonian (edited by David Hurst Thomas}—which brought together the results of archaeological
and historical research that treats the legacy of European-American contact from a variety of perspec-
tives. The Plenary Session of the 1992 Annual Meeting of the SAA will not attempt to cover this
ground again; it will not be a summary of current thinking about the various episodes and contexts
that comprise ‘Columbian contact” and its consequences. Rather, it takes as its point of departure a
recognition of the radically diverse—'‘artificial, disjounted’’ (DHT 8), widely contested and thoroughly
perspectival—nature of the accounts and understandings that were presented and discussed in these
sessions, and asks what implications this has for the future practice of archaeology in the Americas.
More specifically, it is intended to raise a series of questions about the socio-political entanglements
and consequences of archaeological research as, itself, part of the legacy of contact.

archaeologist and the public at large. How we view the past, both our own past and that of other
peoples, directly affects how we use and misuse it in the present. The past is not a neutral or value-
tree concept. Whether viewed as exotic (positive) or danger-frought (negative), the relegation of the
past to the status of foreign country often has alarming political, economic, and social consequences
for the present. In this symposium we examine the pasts (real and recreated) that we professionally

[612] ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR FOOD SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION
SYSTEMS IN COMPLEX SOCIETIES: AN EXAMPLE FROM COLONIAL
MASSACHUSETTS.

This paper is a comparative analysis of over 11,000 bones from two urban and two rural historical
sites in eastern Massachusetts. Explicit hypotheses are evaluated about how the urban environment
and particular characteristics of food supply and exchange systems might affect specific aspects of
faunal assemblage patterning. Taxonomic representation, body part representation, butchery patterns,
and age and seasonal slaughtering patterns are all interpreted. The results of the analysis suggest that
urban food supply and distribution systems followed traditional rural patterns.

[608] SPATIAL SCALE IN PALEOLITHIC STONE TECHNOLOGY: THE LATE SOLUTREAN
PERIGORD.

Concepts for operational sequence in stone technologies must encompass spatial scale. Region-
wide movements for chert packages (from raw blocks to finished implements) reflect complex socioeco-
nomics in global sequences. By chance, the geological structure of the Périgord (France) distributes
chert sources into two geographic zones. A central zone holds most sources for common cherts (and
most Paleolithic sites). A peripheral zone holds fewer but better sources (and fewer but more special-
ized production sites). Representation of chert types tor exhausted late Soluterean (ca 18 kyr) foliate
points at central and peripheral sites suggests patterns of circulation for chert packages between
zones.

{404] TOWARD A HOLISTIC ANALYSIS OF CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGES.

A holistic approach to the analysis of chipped stone assemblages that integrates separate analyses
of tools and debitage allows a much more in-depth consideration of prehistoric technological organiza-
tion than conventional studies that use tools or debitage alone. The technique of minimum nodule
analysis allows a consideration of chipped stone acquisition, production, use, and discard activities,
and provides one measure of the flow of matter, energy, and information across the archaeological
landscape. Comparison of results from the minimum nodule analyses of two high altitude archaeologi-
cal sites in the Central Rocky Mountains provides an example of this approach.

ARCHAIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS,

A simulated archaeological record is created to examine the interplay among geologic, botanical,
and anthropological factors controlling settlement pattems in western Kentucky's Middle and Late
Archaic. The simulation results are compared to the results of archaeological survey by the Lower

a Cumberland Archaeological Project. The comparison suggests that apparent differences in settlement
patterns between the periods are a result of responses by a single settlement system to changing
botanical and hydrologic conditions from the Middle to Late Holocene.

Recent archaeological investigations in the American Southwest challenge traditional notions of

diets, The adoption and persistence of com agriculture, however, cannot be understood apart fromthe
climatic conditions favorable to com growth and development. A method is presented for agroclimatic
reconstruction from tree-ring width indices that demonstrates the level of variability in com yields
over time in the northern Southwest. It also provides a much needed standard, crop shortfalls from
normal harvests, making preliminary regional comparisons possible.

the Sausa people, the indigenous perception of the landscape, and the effects of social structure on
the use and discard of plant materials. I suggest that the relationship between the people and their

[407] MACROBOTANICAL REMAINS AS INDICATORS OF ANCIENT AGRICULTURAL

The analysis and interpretation of botanical macroremains from Mesoamerican archaeological
deposits can provide essential data concerning both ancient subsistence practices and paleoenviron-
ments as well. Carbonized plant domesticates furnish evidence regarding crop production, trade
interactions, consumption, and food processing, while the remains of wild plants offer insights
into dietary supplementation, medicinal and ceremonial practices, seasonality, plant communities
targeted for exploitation, and the nature of the communities themselves. Archaeological charcoal has
great potential as a data source for paleoenvironmental reconstruction, Although macrobotanical
analysis offers a wealth of interpretive information derived directly from artifacts buried in the ground,
these data are best utilized when synthesized with data from other avenues of investigation.

production system. Variations in stone tool production/use at the household level, along with data
from the local lithic deposits (workshops/dumps}, provide the basis for this analysis.

[608] ALEUTIAN MARITIME HUNTING STRATEGIES.

Peter Bleed has drawn a distinction between reliable and maintainable technologies, which to some
extent parallels Lewis Binford’s distinctions between collecting and foraging strategies. While both
of these formulations are useful, they have shortcomings when applied to maritime hunter-gatherers,
particularly those of the high latitudes. The constraints of the environment—hunting over the sea,
very limited industrial resources, high seasonality—require a unique mix of strategies for successful
exploitation. In examining the mix developed by the prehistoric Aleuts, the ways that human decision-
making is constrained by the ecological conditions people face can be better appreciated.

population pressures and prevailing climatic conditions were sufficient to suppress reforestation.
Conversely, deforestation of the Peten ca 3200 BP may have coincided with increased regional aridity.
Thus, Mayan events may be more closely linked with climatic factors than previously assumed.

This paper examines diversity in mobility strategies during the late Epipaleolithic of the southern
Levant. Evidence for reduced mobility from various kinds of faunal data, including seasonally depos-
ited incremental tissues in gazelle teeth, are examined from a wide array of Natufian, Geometric
Kebaran, and Kebaran sites in the southern Levant. While mobility patterns during the Natufian
appear to be less residentially mobile than those of previous cultural complexes, it is argued that the
Natufians cannot necessarily be classified as sedentary.” It is argued that hunter-gatherer mobility
strategies are rarely static, and that from a heuristic perspective, sedentism is an elusive if not tenuous
concept.

This paper examines different facets of the reburial issue and attempts to show why many reason-

into the emotional aspects of the issue. This problem must not be reduced into a “Science vs Religion"
dispute because such a quarrel cannot easily be resolved. Instead, archaeology should work harder at

getting more Native Americans into archaeology, perhaps we should try to get more archaeologists

and the regional dynamics of southern Maryland in the early 19th century.

Effective hydration temperature (EHT} is essential for the computation of obsidian hydration dates.
In the Atacama Desert the scarcity of air-temperature records combines with extremes of elevation

Compositional analysis (sourcing) and hydration rate development also are necessary, especially
where other dating methods are unavailable to confirm the hydration rate. Paleoindian or Early
Archaic through modern obsidian dates support a human settlement pattern history derived from

Recent research in the eastern Ozarks has produced evidence of widespread Emergent Mississippian

appearance of shell-tempered ceramics, arrow points, and rectangular wall trench houses. Despite
these cultural innovations, settlement and subsistence patterns reflect continuity with well estab-
lished practices in this region. High inter-site variability during the Emergent Mississippian substage
is interpreted as evidence of local autonomy. About AD 1300, there is evidence that Emergent
Mississippian people abandoned the eastern Ozarks, probably to participate more fully in the newly
forming chiefdoms of southeast Missouri,

Monasteries constituted an enduring component of medieval settlement. This paper examines the
relationship between monastic sites (including their dependent holdings) and previous occupation
history. It considers disruptions in climate, advances in agricultural technique, and shifts in landhold-

absorbed three new reform orders that settled old and new lands in different ways. Some sought
deserted rural sites, while others settled near towns. All three orders vied for property in the former
chalk deserts newly discovered to be suitable for viticulture. In this paper, we not only trace the
spatial distribution of monastic settlement, we lay the framework for evaluating continuities and
discontinuities in high medieval settlement.

In 1566 Pedro Menéndez met Carlos, king of the Calusa. With Carlos rested the prerogative of life
or death over thousands, and the right to recieve tribute from towns across south Florida. His people
, 82 Marquet, Pablo

built earthworks, temples, and waterways. Commoners provided for the nobles and the military.

Remarkably, the sedentary, hierarchichal, tributary Calusa were not farmers but fisher-folk. Some

argue that the Calusa attained their complexity by AD 800. However, it is also possible that changes

in Calusa social and political organization occurred rapidly in the early 1500s, as they were drawn
inexorably into the European dominated mercantile/imperial economy.

[612] THE WINDROSE SITE: EVIDENCE FOR ANIMAL EXPLOITATION AT A LATE 18TH/
EARLY 19TH CENTURY HABITATION SITE IN KANKAKEE COUNTY, ILLINOIS.

Investigations in 1991 at the Kankakee River State Park in northeastern Illinois disclosed the
presence of a late 18th/early 19th century habitation site. Test excavations at the Windrose site
(11Ka318A) revealed both Euroamerican and Native American materials associated with a large
assemblage of animal remains. Although artifacts do not allow for a more specific temporal! placement,
documents clearly indicate the presence of Potawatomi habitation sites in the area. Beyond demonstra-
ting exploitation of local wild animal resources, the faunal assemblage provides insights into accultura-
tion and the local fur trade.

[710] TOWARD THE RESOLUTION OF THE FOLSOM-MIDLAND PROBLEM.

Since the discovery in 1953 of the first Midland Paleoindian assemblages, there have been questions
of their temporal, technological, and typological affinities with better known Folsom materials.
Folsom and Midland assemblages are similar, yet in some significant ways, they are quite different.
Using stratigraphic and lithic data from eight Folsom-Midland sites, this paper addresses the relation-
ships between these two Paleoindian assemblages on the Southern High Plains. By conducting field
excavation and statistical analysis, new information has been obtained that will help us to address a
problem that has stubbornly defied resolution for nearly 40 years.

[706] BUILDING DEDICATION, NAHUAL TRANSFORMATION, AND CAPTIVE SACRIFICE
AT MONTE ALBAN: POLITICORELIGIOUS STRATEGIES OF ANCIENT ZAPOTEC
LEADERSHIP.

A comparison of structural attributes of carved monuments throughout Oaxaca reveals that patterns
of rulership legitimization were displayed in public ritual. Analogies drawn to recent interpretations
from Maya (Schele and Freidel 1990) and Olmec (Reilly 1989, 1991) iconography identify Zapotec
participation in an inter-regional Mesoamerican system of ideas and symbols. Oaxacan affinities with

— this system are expressed in rituals of religion and warfare which include captive-taking, sacrifice,
and shaman-like animal transformation. Inter-regional comparisons of recent work breathe new
significance into formal patterns of Zapotec politicoreligious iconography, examined here in the
archaeological context of building dedication.

In 1991 I investigated a series of Basketmaker UI (BM Il) sites on Cedar Mesa that were not clearly
BM I, in unusual! places, or in environmental locations that were similar to reported late Archaic
sites. Limited excavation showed that some were good BM II habitation sites complete with pithouses,
albeit in unique settings. Others, interpreted as BM Il ‘‘campsites’’ during the regional sampling and
surface collection oriented Cedar Mesa project of the 1970s, were found to be associated with diagnos-
tic BM II sandstone slab-lined cists, confirming their initial identification. Finally, one habitation site
appears to be the first Anasazi defensive “cliff dwelling.’’

203] THE USE OF TEMPORALLY RESTRICTED DATA IN EVOLUTIONARY STUDIES.

Archaeologists are often faced with temporally restricted data bases that have a regional distribunon.
When confronted with a lack of time depth, how can archaeologists examine adaptation when such
studies require at least some examination of diachronic frequency changes in selected traits? How
might we distinguish neutral traits from those subjected to selective processes? Or, how can we
evaluate the possible selective processes that may have affected the temporally isolated traits under
study? Some potential approaches are examined using data from the North American Southwest.
These approaches include ecological studies and engineering analyses that focus on function.

1704] ANCESTOR WORSHIP AS AN ORGANIZATIONAL FULCRUM OF LAND TENURE IN
THE MAYA LOWLANDS.

Systems of land tenure generally involve the intergenerational transfer of use nights or proprietary
control of resources. Linkages with the dead, which are actively and continually expressed ritualisti-
eally, serve to organize and maintain the channels of land transfer. Ancestor worship is one potential
sedicator of the entrenchment of these channels. The genesis of the practice of “living with the dead”
om the Maya lowlands is discussed in the light of recent findings at the Formative site of K’axob. It is
suggested that the emergence of social inequality may be linked inextricably to these exclusionary
social and economic practices.

[709] COASTAL ADAPTATIONS IN EASTERN LONG ISLAND SOUND.

The development and variability of coastal adaptations in eastern Long Island Sound are examined
from a temporal and geographic perspective. Archaeological evidence indicates a shift in settlement
and subsistence patterns to coastal areas and resources beginning around 600 BC. This phenomenon
appears to be associated with the decline in the rate of marine transgression and the development of
dal marshes in the region. Archaeological evidence also suggests a considerable degree of variability
among coastal groups with respect to settlement/subsistence patterns and the importance of marine
resources in the diet.

Archaeologists have begun to realize that complex secondary deposits, rather than bedrock deposits,
are frequently the source of lithic raw materials. The use of such complex deposits in prehistory,
however, is poorly understood. Physical analysis of chert properties is used to document changes in
the selection criteria employed by prehistoric artisans in exploiting a complex gravel source in

[710] DEFINING SITE-SPECIFIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL POTENTIALS: AN EVALUATION OF A
GEOARCHAEOLOGIC APPROACH.

Ranking geoarchaeologic potentials is a cost effective method to evaluate sites and locales having
the capability to yield significant archaeological and environmental data. Site/locale ranking employs
terrain analysis procedures to group similar landforms and a classification of both site specific surface
and subsurface geomorphic and pedologic characteristics. Hierarchical ranking is based upon various
attributes that include geomorphic positions {erosional vs depositional), degree of preservation of the
soil/sediment record, and availability of resources. Testing of the method within various terrains/
environments traversed by an 80-km right of way in north central New Mexico suggests that these
quantitative procedures are helpful in designating sites/locales for intensive examination.

Recent investigations into the development of Epiclassic-era circum-Basin regionalism indicate
that the ancient metropolis of Cholollan, Puebla, was at the heart of a pan-Mesoamerican exchange
network. This network, which rivalled that centered on ancient Teotihuacan, aligns with that posited
for Robert Zeitlin’s (1982) obsidian-based Isthmian exchange model. Gulf Coast-Central Highland
exchange patterns, iconographic and architectural conventions, and mortuary data are taken to support
Cholollan’s proposed role. Preliminary observations indicate that Cholollan‘s interactions with the
Mexican Gulf Coast, circum-Basin Mesoamerica, and further afield, the southern Maya highlands,
were sufficient to have eclipsed Teotihuacan’s interactions with the corresponding areas.

[106] INTRIGUE OF THE PAST: INVESTIGATING ARCHAEOLOGY, A SECONDARY
EDUCATION PROJECT.

The secondary education project contains two major components: development of usable materials
and delivery to teachers who will use them. Prime developmental considerations were the culture of
secondary education and teachers’ needs. The lessons target many Utah Core Curriculum objectives
required in traditional subjects such as Utah studies, history, geography, and science. The guide
contains recent research, hands-on activities for school settings, and application of the scientific
method to archaeological problems. Archaeological concepts and problems are used as themes. Inser-
vice workshops are used. Workshops are instructed by teachers and archaeologists, thus forming a
fink between the two professions.

[306] HIGHLAND-COASTAL INTERACTION IN THE MIXTECA.

This paper examines highland-coastal interaction during the Postclassic period in terms of the
marketing system developed in the Mixteca to exchange products between kingdoms occupying
complementary ecozones. It suggests that these markets were not situated in the ceremonial centers
of these often competing polities, but along their boundaries, in neutral areas, where they were
frequently associated with pilgrimages and other ritual events.

[103] A REINDEER HUNTERS’ WINTER CAMP DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM.

The site of Grubgraben, Lower Austria, was occupied repeatedly between 19,000 and 16,000 BP.
The paper focuses on the topmost layer (AL1), which includes the remains of a senes of occupations
by small groups of Epigravettian reindeer hunters adapted to the severe environmental! conditions of
the last major glacial advance. Statistical analyses are used to investigate the formation and arrange-
ment of features and spatial distribution of artifacts and faunal remains. An interpretation of the site's
organization is proposed.

[213] THE YOUNGER DRYAS AND THE TRANSITION FROM FORAGING TO FARMING IN
SOUTHWEST ASIA.

We present new evidence suggesting that the Younger Dryas (c | 1,000-10,000 BP} worldwide episode
of cooling had a significant impact on climate, vegetation, and human economy in Southwest Asia.
A new pollen core extracted from Lake Huleh and plant remains from the early village of Abu Hurayra
| indicate that forest gave way to steppe contemporary with the Younger Dryas. This deterioration
in climate and vegetation led to significant disruptions in culture and settlement over a wide area.
We argue that the stresses induced by these events were a contributory factor in the subsequent
development of agriculture in Southwest Asia.

{208] ANALYSIS OF VERTEBRATE REMAINS FROM WARNER VALLEY, OREGON,

In Warner Valley, Oregon, the University of Nevada at Reno (cooperating with the BLM) has
excavated LS sites on lakeshores, in dunes, and in upland locations over five field seasons. More than
18,000 bones of vertebrates have been recovered from sites dating from terminal Pleistocene to late
Holocene, Analyses of the bones have identified at least 13 taxa. The sites show variability in
seasonality and hunting strategies by the prehistoric occupants. The analyses also allow models to
be constructed of changes in paleoenvironments and paleozoogeography.

[506] MEASURES OF MOBILITY AND OCCUPATIONAL INTENSITY IN A SEVERE BUT LESS-
~SEASONAL ENVIRONMENT IN PERU.

Preceramic (9000-3800 BP) and Formative (3800-1500 BP) occupations on the Junin Puna of Peru

‘ are local adaptations to severe daily climate changes but only minor seasonal variation, Attention
has been directed toward whether this pattern led to a relatively non-seasonal or possibly sedentary
prehistoric occupation. Fragmentation and alteration of animal bone was used to measure variation
in occupational intensity at Panaulauca, a deeply stratified cave site. Two distinct patterns emerged—
an early period of moderate occupational intensity followed by a period of heightened occupa-
tional intensity, Qualitative indicators of seasonality from bones in the same layers confirm this
interpretation.

[605] FROM IDEOTECHNICS TO SYMBOLS: ETHNIC IDENTITY AND ETHNICITY OF
ALGONQUIAN AND IROQUOIAN GROUPS IN THE CENTRAL EASTERN SUBARCTIC.

The descriptive/normative concept of ethnic identity derived from sociocultural anthropology,
applied to archaeological remains from the central Eastern Subarctic, tends to emphasize mobile
hunter-gatherer Algonquian adaptive traits over sedentary food-producer Iroquoian patterns. An alter-
native concept of ethnicity as a social process clarifies cultural developments that led to the presence
of both Algonquian and [roquoian patterns in the central Eastern Subarctic. The propensity of archaeol-
ogists to adopt definitions of ethnic identity and ethnicity from sociocultural anthropology may
produce inappropriate theoretical bases for understanding the northern Iroquoian and Algonquian
communities that were likely linked by fluid social ties.

§s10] INTRA-SITE SPATIAL DATA INTEGRATION: GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS

ON MICRO-SCALE.

Archaeologists commonly employ database systems to retrieve and manipulate datasets generated
Sy excavation. Geographic information systems (GIS) are particularly well suited to handle spatially
seferenced data. The ability of GIS to rapidly analyze databases, create new information, and display
mesults in cartographic representations offers an unrealized potential in archaeology. This paper links
eechaeology and GIS to provide a visual analysis of research data collected from an Anasazi site in
seethwestern Utah. Specifically, pueblo architecture is integrated with artifact distributions, micro-
sepography, and geophysical data enabling the systematic exploration of spatial relationships among
themes. Analysis reveals correlations between attributes.

\412| REFITTING AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION: SOME OBSERVATIONS
FROM THE TWIN DITCH SITE, GREENE COUNTY, ILLINOIS.

The refitting of stone tools and debris is a powerful technique for investigating intrasite spatial
structure. However, all refits are not created equal. The types and origins of fractures resulting in
refittable fragments strongly pattern both the frequency and spatial array of conjounable pieces. This
paper explores the contexts of refitted lithic artifacts recovered from Horizon 2 of the Twin Ditch
site, a well preserved, buried Early Archaic habitation surface in the lower Illinois River Valley.
Several tentative explanations are suggested for the patterns observed.

[109] FLOOD EVENTS, EL NINO EVENTS, AND TECTONIC EVENTS.

Along the hyper-arid coast of Peru, the coastal geoarchacological record of Palea-flood events
exhibits episodes of exceptionally severe erosion and deposition that greatly exceed those produced
by the 1925-26 and 1982-83 El Ninos. Were the erosion and deposition strictly dependent on the
amount of precipitation, then serious landscape modification should indicate extreme ENSO condi-
mons or ancient “mega-nino”’ phenomena. However, when these very strong ENSO events are preceded
by major tectonic activity, the synergistic consequences seem to lead to “radical environmental
alteration cycles” (REACS), which exacerbate both erosion and deposition. Investigations have been
conducted in the Ilo region and at the Santa River mouth in an effort to find correlations in the
geoarchacological record for the synergistic consequences of prehistoric and historic flood, El Nino,
and tectonic events that might represent pan-Andean horizon markers along the entire arid coast.

PRACTICES ON CAPE COD.

This paper presents the preliminary results from a Late Prehistoric/Early Historic Native American
site discovered on Cape Cod that contains the remains of a Native American field. The field 1s
comprised of over 40 intact “cormhills” that appear to date to the late 16th/early 17th century. The
site may represent a refuge site associated with the 1622 pacification program of Plymouth Plantation
designed to insure hegemony over Cape Cod. The primary focus of the paper is the results of prelimi-

[403] MACRO-REGIONAL INTERACTION IN THE SOUTHEAST.

Southeastern polities interacted at different levels at different times. Communities rarely were
integrated much beyond the local level. Even so, quantities of sumptuary and other goods were
exchanged, Several more-or-less explicit models of these exchange systems have been proposed. Early
models for macro-regional exchange often emphasized political and religious integration of large areas.
Other models suggest elite-to-elite exchange as part of a ‘prestige economy.” Relatively simple down-
the-line exchange models (some even paralleling the Kula Ring) also have been proposed. Models of
southeastern exchange are evaluated in terms of what we may learn about macro-regional integration
in the Southeast.

The bronze industry of the Dian chiefdom in Yunnan Province was among the most sophisticated
in ancient China. Among the vast quantities of bronze artifiacts recovered from the tombs of the
Dian elite, the skill of the Dian metallurgists is best shown in the highly detailed two- and three-
dimensional scenes of ritual activity that adorn many of the bronzes. A careful reading of these scenes,
when combined with ethnohistorical observations in a number of ancient texts from south and
southwest China, provides an intimate look at the role of ritual in Dian society in the late first

[408] LATE BRONZE AGE LANDSCAPE TO IRON AGE URBANSCAPE: A STUDY OF

SETTLEMENT DISCONTINUITIES AT KELHEIM AN DER DONAU, BAVARIA.

The large, defended sites of the European Late Iron Age (oppida) have generally been treated as
singular phenomenon, uniform in function and enigmatic in origin. Little work has been attempted
on the study of the hinterlands of these sites, and on the cultural landscapes in which they emerged.
A current program of field and archival work characterizes changes in the cultural landscape surround-
ing the oppidum of Kelheim during the final millennium BC. The results of this study suggest that
discontinuities in the structuring of the landscape require the rethinking of Late Iron Age oppida as
uniform “urban” economic and social nodes.

AITUTAKI, SOUTHERN COOK ISLANDS.

The effects of screen size on faunal remains has been documented by numerous researchers in

The fish assemblages from a Cook Islands rockshelter were analyzed to determine the effects of screen
size on the distribution and frequency of taxa. The analysis shows no significant difference in the
rank ordering of fish taxa recovered from 1/4” versus 1/8” screens. The apparent similarity in recovery
between the two screen sizes is probably caused by the large sample size, family level identifications,
and limited reference collection.

[310] THE ROLE OF CHIPPED LITHICS IN THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF SOCIAL
RANKING.

Chipped lithics can figure prominently in the transformation of social relationships. For instance,
encipient elites may try to aggrandize themselves by controlling access to resources or the production
process. I examine three aspects of stone tool technology—acquisition, labor allocation, and intensifi-
cation—to explore how lithics were implicated in the integration and disintegration of the Plum
Bayou culture in central Arkansas (ca AD 600-1000). The analyses expose longitudinal changes in the
organization of technology which suggest rudimentary attempts at control and/or intensification.
Despite these efforts, socially ranked individuals apparently failed to monopolize raw materials or
production.

sedentism, pattern of dispersion, subsistence strategy, and earthwork-burial-settlement relationships.
They are based upon data acquired largely during the last decade, much of it unpublished, and go tar

This symposium brings together those archaeologists working in high elevation (over 2500 m) areas
in both North and South America to provide a two continent view on how high altitude areas were

shell, cacao, and cotton were sought by highland populations. Formative-Classic period interaction
between the coast and the highland centers of Monte Alban and Teotihuacan are examined, as 15 the
role of the Ejutla Valley as an intermediary in coastal-highland interaction. The impact of the Postclas-
sic coastal city-state of Tututepec on the highlands is discussed.

[307] SUBSISTENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN OCEANIA.

The islands of Oceania provide natural laboratories for the study of evolutionary change because
they vary in their ecological complexity and relative isolation. Islands also vary in their histones of
human occupation, with colonization dating from the Pleistocene to modern times. In this regard,
archaeological research on floral and faunal assemblages 1n Oceania traces the evolution of human
subsistence and the associated impact on island environments. Documenting subsistence and environ-
mental change requires solving problems of recovery, quantification, and comparability. In this
symposium we address these methodological issues and their link to theoretical models in island
settings.

were the southwestern and southeastern great towns? How complex were their polities? How were
their polities organized? What kinds of ties bound these polities together into macro-regional systems?
What kinds of ties did the southwestern and southeastern macro-regions have with Mesoamerica?
The concluding papers evaluate how well current evolutionary models explain southwestern and
southeastern sociopolitical development.

[404] THE ORGANIZATION OF STONE TOOL TECHNOLOGIES,

Studies of technological organization attempt to understand how technological strategies are linked
to environmental conditions and prehistoric behavior. Technological organization is determined
through a consideration of raw material procurement, manufacture, use, reuse, and discard of tool
types as related to social, economic, and environmental factors. In this symposium, investigations ot |
prehistoric stone tool assemblages utilizing an organization of technology approach are presented. |
New perspectives on the study of technological organization are advanced, and the utility of employing |
an organizational approach to prehistoric stone tool technologies is demonstrated.

however, has a body of problem-oriented research focused on the nature of Tiwanaku economic,
political, and cultural dominion across the South Central Andes. This symposium brings together
recent research from Peru, Chile, and Bolivia on the expansion and peripheral integration of Tiwanaku
(AD 350-1000). The diversity of the Tiwanaku phenomenon is represented as it relates to trade,
colonization by altiplano Tiwanaku settlers, or some other form of state or imperial hegemony over

[203] THE ROLE OF “SOURCING” IN EVOLUTIONARY ARCHAEOLOGY.

continuous traditions of tool manufacture and use. From this perspective, compositional analysis of
artifacts jor sourcing”) makes two crucial contributions to evolutionary archaeology; (1) it helps
demonstrate historical continuity by tying artifacts to localized raw materials; and (2) it reveals how
raw material procurement and preparation within particular traditions diversified over time. Recent
studies of Guatemalan pottery, discussed briefly in this paper, exemplify the application of composi-
tional analysis within an evolutionary framework.

is the result of the intersection of 1) sampling error in the transmission of cultural information, and
2) learning rules, fixed by natural selection, that determine how energy is allocated in learning and
performance. The models offer expectations for the dynamics of drift as monitored archaeologically
and suggest answers to several outstanding questions in archaeological method.

Mortality curves and pathological profiles are developed for five strategic cases and used to evaluate

political economy; little support is found for interpreting these phenomena as a function of aggrega-
tion, environmental marginality, or length of occupation. The apparent association between political
structure and biological disruption is relevant to the ongoing debate about social inequality in the

technological characteristics of late Basketmaker [I assemblages are compared with those of Basket-
maker Il] and Pueblo II-[II assemblages. Lithic technological indicators of Basketmaker [1 mobility

Archaeozoologists have grown increasingly sophisticated in recognizing natural and cultural modi-
Gecations to bone surfaces, One area of interest is in whether or not the raw material used to produce
a cut can be identified on the basis of cutmark attributes. In this research study, cutmarks produced
by iron, copper, and chert edges were evaluated using low power microscopy (20-140X). Our results
suggest that it may be possible to differentiate between raw materials even without the use of more
sensitive microscopy. This finding deserves further evaluation because of the potential for identifying
the early introduction of metal implements into various cultural contexts.

tion of this stratigraphy with archaeological data collected from the site provides information that
can be used to aid the interpretation of the timing, operation, and function of the Boylston Fishweir
structure. These sources of evidence together provide insights into human adaptations to coastal
settings during the late Archaic in New England.

{506] MACROBOTANICAL SEASONAL INDICATORS FROM SUBTROPICAL AND TROPICAL
CLIMATES.

Timing of fruit production for macrobotanical remains and growth-ring analysis of wood samples
have been applied at Florida Archaic period sites to examine season of occupation and the issue of
sedentism. Plant measures were examined relative to complementary faunal measures to clarify site
use. Subtropical Florida is subject less to annual fluctuations in temperature than to variations in
moisture availability. Phenologies of native trees coincide, as in much of the seasonally dry tropics,
with the rainfall regime. Sensitive plant measures of seasonal site use are available for sites in southern
Florida and the Canbbean, as in temperate regions.

[505] IRRIGATION AND THE TEOTIHUACAN STATE.

The growth of Teotihuacan led to major changes in the agricultural landscape of its hinterland that
included the development of irrigation. Economic models often assume maximization of production;
, 96 Nickens, Paul & Roger Saucier
however, Jeffrey Parsons has recently argued that exerting direct control over agricultural production
was often more important to the Teotihuacan state than productive efficiency. Archaeological excava-
tions and survey data indicate a complex state strategy of manipulating irrigated land and water
resources, in some cases, to intensify agricultural production, but, in other cases, valuable irrigable
land was actually taken out of production to facilitate the nucleation of population at Teotihuacan.

[707] ENGINEERING SOLUTIONS FOR HERITAGE PRESERVATION: THE ROLE OF THE

CORPS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION RESEARCH.

During the past 20 years North American archaeology has witnessed an increased recognition of
the need for a conservation approach for the remaining vestiges of the archaeological record. Federal
agencies likewise have achieved greater understanding of the need to effectively manage and preserve
resources under their jurisdiction. Over the past seven years the Corps of Engineers has assumed a
postion of leadership among agencies producing research leading to meaningful in situ archaeological
site protection and preservation. This paper discusses the factors that led to the initiation of this
research effort, the objectives, the substantive results that have been produced, and directions for the

|703] THIS Is NOT ANOTHER PAPER ON FORMATION PROCESSES.

Behavioral Archaeology was introduced in the mid-1970s as both a methodological and theoretical
program that emphasized behavior as a central unit of analysis. Most accomplishments of the program,
however, have been confined to the realm of behavioral reconstruction. Post-processual Archaeology,
on the other hand, has raised a number of relevant theoretical issues without offering an acceptable
methodology to address them. This paper emphasizes the need to develop adequate methodologies
for current theoretical questions. This point is illustrated by the consideration of relevant behaviors
that need to be reliably measured to study religion, gender and technology, and political economy in
prehistory:

[703] THE FIT BETWEEN BEHAVIORAL ARCHAEOLOGY AND A DARWINIAN-BASED
EVOLUTIONARY ARCHAEOLOGY.

In the early 1970s Reid, Schiffer, and Rathje espoused an archaeology design to examine various
relations between human behavior and material culture, regardless of time or place. One strategy of
this archaeology was a search for laws useful in describing and explaining human behavior. At first
glance behavioral archaeology appears to have little in common with a Darwinian-based evolutionary
archaeology, given that under the latter approach the only important law is that of contingency. But
in fact, the fit is closer than it appears, since both perspectives focus on material items and the
behaviors that create those items.

603] THE CHARACTERIZATION OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY AND ITS ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RECOGNITION.

Implicit in any discussion of ‘emergent’ complexity is the assumption that complex societal organi
zation can be detected and correctly identified in the archaeological record. Yet, many of the attributes
that archaeologists frequently associate with complex organization, such as hereditary and ascriptive
social positions or the unequal distributrion of exotic goods, are common among tribal societies that
would not normally be termed complex. This paper considers the archaeological evaluation of social
complexity in a series of ethnographic and archaeological cases, with particular emphasis on the
domains of mortuary treatment and spatial organization.

HUNTING AND FORAGING STRATEGIES.

The reconstruction of Paleolithic hunting/foraging strategies is daunting since it depends on a
wast array of both identifiable and indeterminate variables. The less discernable factors affecting
subsistence behavior include daily temperature and precipitation, prey population fluctuations, the

chat simple processes in nature can produce unexpectedly complex results and that order emerges in
this complexity, has taken hold in such diverse disciplines as astronomy, ecology, and economics.

The traditional! archaeological view is that preservation of organic remains in tropical environments

the pH values from the Classic period, Patio H, 9N-8, in the Sepulturas area of Copan, shows the
values are culturally modified through the use of lime plaster and that these values are differentially
distributed near buildings. The carbonates in the plaster buffer the acidity and create an environment
favoring the preservation of faunal bone and skeletal material. These conditions are not uniformly
distributed in residences throughout the Copan Valley.

England and adjacent areas suggest that many of the lroquoian diagnostic ceramic attributes were
more widely employed by non-lroquoian populations, Differentiation of diagnostic and nondiagnostic
attributes for Iroquoian populations and the variable scales at which they operated is therefore critical.

Likewise, the validity of defining prehistoric ethnicity and other social issues, such as cultural

[203] VARIATION IN EVOLUTIONARY ARCHAEOLOGY.

Evolution has been a common theme in archaeological research since the beginnings of a disciplin-
ary archaeology in the late 1800s. Archaeologists look at things over comparatively long time spans,
and these things change; this change is then characterized as “evolutionary.” A major focus of
archaeological research has been to identify the mechanisms that cause the observed change. Pime
mover models, systems theory, and processual archaeology are all such attempts. However, in doing
so, techniques often focus on central tendencies (and how they vary over time), rather than synchronic
variation within a population (and how the structure of that variation changes over time). This
focus hinders our understanding of how things change. In this paper recent evolutionary studies are
examined to illustrate this point, and alternative approaches are suggested.

$605] IROQUOIS COMMUNITY PATTERNS: EVIDENCE OF LONG-TERM ETHNIC IDENTITY
AT THE FRINGE OF IROQUOIA.

For historical reasons, archaeologists trace Iroquois development within the tribal areas held at
European contact. Because of the emphasis on recent prehistoric antecedents and the lack of earlier
tes within this region, most chronologies begin with the Castle Creek phase. But settled agricultural
life in palisaded villages with longhouses—aspects of Iroquoian culture that are closely bound to
ethnic identity—occurred by AD 1000 in “fringe” areas such as the Susquehanna drainage. | suggest
thet: Iroquoia originally developed to the south and west, ethnicity must be defined contextually,
aed community patterns are an equal indicator of ethnicity as language or ceramics.

1202] LEGISLATING RESPECT FOR THE DEAD: WHERE WE ARE, HOW WE GOT HERE,
WHERE WE ARE HEADED.

Modal values of society are reflected in laws, both of which are subject to change through time.
The issue of respectful treatment of aboriginal remains and cultural materials in the United States is
ese such case. Beginning with the Antiquities Act of 1906 through the Native American Grave
Protection Act of 1990, federal statutes have gradually evolved from a primary focus on acquisition
end curation to a more formal recognition of aboriginal rights. State laws also are following in this
general direction. Enlightened administration of the laws and good-faith communication between
aboriginal and scientific communities will effect an appropriate balance between competing values.

[210] RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY IN THE PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST: AN ARCHAEOMETRIC
APPROACH.

Residential mobility at Grasshopper Pueblo, an 800 year old community, 1s examined using stron-
team isotope ratios in bone and teeth as a signature of the geology of the area where individuals from
these sites grew up and where they died. Comparison of values in bone with local bedrock and faunal
semains documents the strontium isotope signatures for the region. Non-local strontium isotope
ratios in teeth indicate emigrants to the site. There are measurable and meaningful differences
between bones and teeth from the same individuals, among individuals from the same site, and
between communities in the study area. This method provides an opportunity to assess directly the
movement of prehistoric peoples in the Southwest.

[414] THE ARCHAEOLOGIST AND THE SACRED TEXT: POLITICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND
THE DIRECT HISTORIC APPROACH.

No sane archaeologist would argue against the importance of ethnographic analogy in the reconstruc-
tion of extinct lifeways. However, a curious theoretical divergence is appearing between theory and
practice in the discipline. Those archaeologists most concerned with the political implications of
archaeological endeavor are also those most likely to give first weight to the direct historic approach
in ethnographic analogy. The political implications of the resulting imputations of “timelessness”
and implied “inherent ethnicity” are discussed.

[509] SETTLEMENT CYCLES AND SOCIOPOLITICAL NONCHANGE IN THE CENTRAL OHIO
VALLEY.

Understanding sociopolitical evolution may be furthered by examining control cases in which large-
scale polities did not form or did not endure. In the Woodland and Fort Ancient traditions (ca 800 BC-
AD 1700) in the central Ohio River Valley, recurring settlement cycles involving aggregation and
dispersal suggest a persistent lack (or repeated failure) of complex polity formation and institutional-
ized systems of inequality. Based upon the same political foundations, long-term sociopolitical non-
change in small-scale societies presents an alternative outcome to the better-known scenarios wherein
increasingly complex polities emerge out of presumably linked processes.

Ethnohistorians have used anthropological theory to interpret historical documents relating to

Archaeologists have used both ethnohistory and anthropology to interpret historic and prehistoric

: Everyone’s world is comprised of two realities: mental and material. Sadly, one reality cannot be
used as a surrogate for the other. Actual foods eaten lead to disease and actual wastes contaminate
groundwater. The problem for researchers who study contemporary issues is that what people report
they did, or will do or even their attitudes, does not effectively predict their behavior. Behavioral
archaeology provides critical baseline data on human existence. Mental and material realities are best
approached independently, and attention should be focused on the way each affects the other.

Analysis of faunal remains from the Nile Delta site of Kom el-Hisn has yielded a model of Old
Emmgdom rural animal production tactics. Kon el-Hisn was a locus of specialized, centrally controlled
cattle and sheep herding with pigs and goats reared for local consumption. This analysis generates
peedictions of the structure of a faunal sample from a site provisioned by a central authority. These

A positive test result has important implications for the potential of faunal data in elucidating

Projections of the potential support capability of prehispanic agricultural systems in the central

Similarly, the potentially long-term destructive effects of Maya agriculture are frequently modeled
upon observations of current slash-and-burn agricultural practices. Unfortunately, however, available

The ethnic identity and social complexity of the Salado continues to be the subject of considerable

Tonto Basin represent a Hohokam population that evolved from a tribal to a chiefdom level of social
organization. An independent comparative study of Salado skeletons has not found the Salado to be
closely related to the Mogollon, rather they seem to be more closely related to the Hohokam. This

While all New World archaeologists are aware of the relationship of Mormonism and the archaeologi-

primarily served as a communicative bridge between the socioeconomic and spiritual worlds among
farious groups, acting as a mechanism for social stability and maintenance.

accompany increased sedentism.

[313] RECOGNIZING POOR HOUSEHOLDS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD: A CASE
STUDY FROM SOUTHERN VERACRUZ, MEXICO.

Archaeological surveys in lowland Mesoamerica often rely on mounds to locate households and on
decorated surface ceramics to date occupations. Recently, test excavations at some Maya sites have
uncovered households where no mound was present, raising the possibility that traditional survey
and excavation techniques are missing poorer households. A search of the ethnographic literature
reveals that relationships between wealth, mobility, and household size may mask the presence of
the poorest households archaeologically. An analysis of surface sherds (both decorated ceramics and
plainware} from a regional survey in southern Veracruz, Mexico, supports the contention that the
poorest households are the most vulnerable to analytical invisibility due to the artifact inventories
they leave behind.

1305] AN ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL OVERVIEW OF PREHISTORIC HUNTERS AND
GATHERERS OF THE SOUTHERN ANDEAN SALT AND DRY PUNA.

Previous explanations of prehistoric hunter-gatherer adaptations in the Salt and Dry Puna of the
south central Andes have primarily focused on transhumance. However, to sharpen our understanding
ef regional organization and mobility, we need to examine not only the direction of seasonal move-
ment, but the kinds of settlements generated and the relationships that existed with coastal popula-
sons. Based on new cultural, zooarchaeological, and pollen data from the south central Andean Salt
aod Dry Puna, we examine regional hunter-gatherer organizational strategies within the ecological
constraints of these highland environments.

§404] CHANGING STRATEGIES OF BIFACE PRODUCTION IN THE SOUTH CAROLINA
COASTAL PLAIN.

Bifaces served similiar functions but different organizational roles over the millennia of southeast-
| em prehistory. Evidence for these roles is tound in strategies of biface production. In the South
| Carolina coastal plain, biface production varied in scale, degree of specialization, and in location
| eelative to quarries. These differences can be related to changes in settlement mobility, subsistence

scheduling, labor organization, and social complexity. While the meager lithic resources of the coastal
plain placed some constraints on the options of tool-makers, strategies of tool design, site provisioning,
and lithic scavenging were effective in overcoming the limitations of a stone-poor environment,

[109] CULTURAL DISRUPTION BY PREHISTORIC AND EARLY HISTORIC EL NINO FLOOD
EVENTS IN THE OSMORE DRAINAGE, ILO PERU.

As demonstrated by the 1925-26 and the 1982-83 El Ninos, the hyperarid coast of Peru is no stranger
to large devastating flood events. Recently discovered evidence clearly shows that ca 1360 AD an
even larger ENSO-driven flood destroyed the largest native irrigated agricultural system to have ever
operated in the lower Osmore drainage near Ilo, Peru. Again in ca 1670 AD another very strong El
Nino severly damaged the Spanish Colonial agrarian system operating in the same valley.

[312] THE DETERMINATION OF CULTURAL VS NATURAL WHALE BONE ASSEMBLAGES.

Archaeological and geological investigations in the Canadian Arctic provide a case study in the
identification of culturally derived vs naturally derived whale bone assemblages. Relative frequencies,
intrasite distribution, modification, and geomorphological context of bone elements differ signifi-
cantly between Thule Eskimo (ca AD 1000-1400) bowhead whale processing sites and early Holocene
bowhead whale natural stranding sites. These differences are demonstrated to relate to the logistics
of whale retrieval and butchering, and element utility, in the case of the Thule processing sites, and
to marine coastal processes in the case of the natural stranding sites.

[402] BETWEEN FARMSTEAD AND CENTER: THE NATURAL AND SOCIAL LANDSCAPE OF
MOUNDVILLE.

About AD 1000 people living in the Black Warrior Valley of Alabama reorganized their social,
political, and economic relations. Their efforts resulted in what we know archaeologically as the
Moundville chiefdom. Past research on Moundville focused on the development of its agricultural
base and on the social and political ties beween Moundville and its subsidiary centers. Little attention
has been given to the economic and political relations of the people who lived in farmsteads. We use
archaeobotanical data and other archaeological evidence to examine the relationships of the people
living in farmsteads to their natural and social environments.

[403] HOW GREAT WERE THE SOUTHEASTERN POLITIES? ECONOMY, SCALE, AND

Evidence of the scale and complexity of the Mississippian poliues can be obtained from data on

site size and distribution. These data suggest that the cultural geography of the late prehistoric
‘ Southeast was highly varied. Overall, the polities were neither as complex as some have argued nor

as simple as others would suggest. Evidence of the economies of the Mississippian societies obtained

from material culture and subsistence remains reveals significant variation in production and

exchange. Nevertheless, the polities shared a reliance on subsistence strategies capable of producing

surpluses that could be used in political and social arenas.

Lithic scatters, 65% of which are undiagnostic, comprise the largest category of sites at Abiquiu
Reservoir in New Mexico. During two mitigation projects over 760 hydration dates from tools and
debitage from surface and subsurface contexts at 54 sites were obtained. Project goals included
establishing obsidian hydration curves for Jemez Mountain varieties, verifying dates of the Oshara
sequence, isolating activity areas, etc. Results suggest several overlapping use episodes rather than
discrete activity areas. Multiple dates from single artifacts indicate reuse through time. Anasazi period
dates on typologically Archaic period points suggest hunting by agriculturalists.

Archaeological excavations in the historic townsite of Grantsville, Nevada, were conducted in a
eariety of contexts including dugouts, houses, and a blacksmith shop. Investigations at 12 features
secovered an abundant yet spatially variable assemblage of food bones, largely represented by domestic
sexa. The resultant collections offer the potential to explore systemic and consumer related relation-
ships affecting intra-feature assemblage variability through the comparative anaysis of faunal quan-
sty, variety, and quality. Mid- to late-19th century foodways also are reviewed to derive implications
for archacofaunal assemblages. This information then is employed to interpret variation observed
emong the features at Grantsville, including differences in household composition and economic

Recognition of prehistoric horticulture in the northeastern Plains has been hindered by comparison
of the region's archaeological sites to Plains Village sites of the Missouri River Valley, the stereotype
ef the region’s native peoples as bison hunters, suggestions that the climate was not conducive to
horticulture, the lack of experimental observations, and the lack of appropriate techniques tor the
recovery of archaeological plant remains. Recent investigations indicate that forager-farmers were
practicing horticulture in the region by AD 1200 and into the early historic period.

Recent research in the Naco Valley, NW Honduras, indicates that political centralization over the

1403] MODELING MISSISSIPPIAN SOCIOPOLITICAL LANDSCAPES: SCALE,

Alternative models of Mississippian sociopolitical organization have proliferated over the past few
decades. New perspectives have evolved in tandem with the rapid accumulation of information on
egional site distributions, internal site organizations, artifact assemblages, and cultural sequences.
Various ideas about the geographical scale, political and economic structure, interregional interaction,
and the long term stability of Mississippian societies are compared. The largest of these systems,
dominated by the Cahokia site, is emphasized. Recent work shows that late prehistoric polities of

Current European archaeology emphasizes investigation of settlement sites and settlement systems.
Increasingly fine chronologies enable us to pinpoint times of establishment and abandonment of
settlements. Through analysis of patterns of continuity and discontinuity, it 1s possible to address
anthropological and historical questions about changes in subsistence practices, migrations to and

{409] HOUSEHOLD STATUS IN AN INDUSTRIAL SETTING: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS
FROM THE EAST LIVERPOOL DATA RECOVERY PROJECT, 1800-1930.

In 1990 urban archaeology was conducted in East Liverpool, Ohio, a major ceramics manufacturing
center, as part of an Ohio Department of Transportation CRM project to investigate the social and
industrial development of the community. A series of eight sites, comprising residential units,
commercial establishments, and two early potteries, were excavated to provide data to examine both
the development of the ceramics industry and the nature of status differentiation between the various
groups comprising the city’s workforce. This symposium presents an overview of the project and
assesses the implications of current perspectives on social status in archacological research,

[413] TECHNOLOGIES FOR PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC PRESERVATION.

The rapid development during the last two decades of new methods, techniques, and equipment
has greatly facilitated archacological research and cultural resources management. This symposium
explores new technologies for dating, geographic information, and protection from looting and vandal-
ism, many of which were originally developed in the natural sciences and engineering and “trans-

ferred” to archaeology. The symposium also examines how new technologies relate to cultural
resources management and to the development of more effective public policies tor funding and

site formation processes, and climatic reconstruction are 4 few of the various topics able to be
addressed through phytolith analysis. This symposium focuses on botanical information and new
extraction methods useful for the interpretation of phytolith data in relation to archaeological objec-

symposium presents research results from a diverse set of seven field schools. These include excava-
tions and research at two 19th-century military forts, Navajo pueblitos, a classic Mimbres pueblo, a
Mogollon rock art site, pithouse villages, and large P-IV pueblos. Advances in southwestern archaeol-

[503] THE LATE CERAMIC AGE IN THE NORTHEAST CARIBBEAN.

The Late Ceramic Age (AD 600-1500) in the Northeast Caribbean |from Puerto Rico in the Greater
Antilles to Montserrat in the northern Lesser Antilles) is not well known despite considerable research
on many islands. Archaeologists from Europe, the Caribbean, Canada, and United States compare
their research on 12 islands/island groups in the region. The goals of the symposium are to: (1) identity

the common elements that link and the dissimilar elements that separate various islands; (2) examine
variability in site densities and settlement patterns; and (3) explore prehistoric sociopolitical organiza-
tion in the region, especially as 1t relates (or perhaps does not relate) to the complex societies
(chiefdoms) in the Greater Antilles and the post-Saladoid culture in the southern Lesser Antilles.

[505] SOCIOECONOMIC PERSPECTIVES ON ANCIENT TEOTIHUACAN.

The ancient city of Teotihuacan, Mexico, was the most complex urban center in Mesoamerica
during the Middle Horizon {AD 200-750). Over the years numerous archaeological projects have
contributed to an understanding of this vast metropolis. The symposium participants integrate these
earlier studies with recent research and present new interpretations, and alternative models, of the
social and economic structure of the city, focusing particular attention on social groups, domestic
institutions, occupational specialization, production activities, health, poverty, and politico-religious
ideology.

[506] SEASONALITY AND SEDENTISM: COMBINING NEW AND OLD WORLD
PERSPECTIVES.

Issues of seasonality and sedentism form a significant part of current research involving “complex”
hunter-gatherers and early agriculturalists in both the Old and New Worlds. In both areas there is a
growing awareness of the complexity of the concepts of seasonality and mobility, and the development
of new techniques to try to evaluate settlement patterns. However, work in the two areas has
proceeded largely independently. The papers in this session combine methodological, theoretical, and
case studies to explore these shared issues in both the Old and New Worlds and to examine the
diversity of approaches to address them.

[507] SMALL STATES: CASES OF DIFFERENT PARADIGMS.

Most constructs for state formation and development stem from analyses of large states. But these
models of centralization, hierarchical development, institutional integration, etc. often fail to possess
any explanatory power in the analysis of small states. Small states are different. They can possess
qualities such as heterarchical organization or incomplete formation, which rarely figure into models
of large state organization and change. This symposium seeks to isolate useful paradigms for the
study of small states and illustrate their archaeological approaches.

[508] FAUNAL EXPLOITATION IN CHIEFDOM LEVEL SOCIETIES.

Differences in economic organization between chiefdoms and simpler societies are manifested at
the community and regional levels in various aspects of the archaeological record, including faunal
remains, Chiefdoms should be distinguished from simpler societies by indicators of status differentia-
tion and specialization, and intersite variability. The papers in this symposium explore faunal exploita-
tion in chiefdoms of varying complexity, including both hunting and gathering and agriculturally
based groups, with particular regard for organizational complexity.

[512] CORRELATING ARCHAEOLOGY AND LINGUISTICS: ALGONQUIANS AND
IROQUOIANS.

At European contact, Algonquians of the Great Lakes were separated from their linguistic relatives
along the Atlantic Coast by [roquoian tribes, who spoke completely unrelated languages. Ethnologists
and linguists have long recognized the implications of these historic distributions, but archaeologists,
until recently, have tended to ignore them. Papers in this symposium examine the archaeological
record with the goals of identifying prehistoric ethnic/linguistic groups, describing their movements
and interactions, and developing theoretical models for migration, population replacement, and lin-
guistic diffusion.

[601] ARCHAEOLOGY FOR THE PUBLIC.

The SAA has recognized the need to encourage the dissemination of archaeological information to
the public, as well as encourage interaction between archaeologists and the public. This session is
the second one to be held at the Society for American Archaeology annual meetings, organized
specifically for the public. Presentation topics include the search for the Columbus landing site,
the impact of European contact on Native Americans, and archaeology in western Pennsylvania.
Comments are provided by representatives from the SAA and the Pennsylvania Bureau of Historic
Preservation. Awards will be presented to the winners of the SAA-sponsored student essay contest.
A question and answer period follows the presentations. The session is free to the public. SAA
members are encouraged to attend and interact with the public.

The Harpers Ferry Armory was established at the conjunction of the Shenandoah and Potomac

industrial towns, southern rural Harpers Ferry’s manufacturing, domestic life, and cultural landscape
was unplanned, undisciplined, and organized according to different priorities and cultural constraints.
A matenial culture analysis demonstrates that material surroundings created and reinforced resistance
to an industrial discipline that often was accepted in the Northeast.

[604] RANGE AND MOBILITY IN THE EARLY HUNTER-GATHERER SOUTHWEST.

One of the most important factors in the reconstruction of hunter-gatherer settlement mobility is
an understanding of the potential range and habitat exploited in a year or series of years. In the
Southwest, virtually no research effort has been expended to investigate the character and extent of
hunter-gatherer procurement ranges. The source provenience of obsidian artifacts recovered from a
number of Middle and Late Archaic sites in Arizona coupled with an examination of ethnographic
hunter-gatherer data in the same region are rallied to reconstruct the probable ranges used during
these periods. The strong upland/lowland composition of these relatively large ranges appears rather
typical of hunter-gatherer organization in arid environments worldwide.

COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION: THE MAISABEL SITE, PUERTO RICO,

Archaeologists working in lowland South America and the West Indies recognize the importance
of cosmology in their interpretations of prehistoric societies. Site structure is an important manifesta-
tion of ancient cosmology. A methodological challenge is to excavate sites for reliable information
on community organization. I present the results of one such study. Maisabel (Puerto Rico} is a
large early ceramic-age settlement intensively occupied for 12 centuries. Site structural data and
ethnographic analogy to appropriate lowland communities are used to develop a model for the
cosmological organization of Maisabel. Cosmology was a major component in the integration of
settlement organization, spatially and temporally.

To many, it seems impossible that the ancestors of the native Peruvians could have created
something as vast in scale and geometrical accuracy as the geoglyphs of Nazca. This attitude is not
restricted to the Nazca Lines but characterizes other ancient phenomena such as the pyramids of
Egypt, the megaliths of Europe, and the colossal statues of Easter Island. In the case of the Nazca
Lines, maintenance of the archaeological past in the realm of mystery has significant economic and
political benefits for the modern Peruvian nation-state, but generates negative attitudes of cultural

[410] ARCHITECTURE AND ENGINEERING AS TOKENS OF THE SPREAD OF TECHNIQUES
AND CONCEPTS IN THE PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST.

Recent studies show that accurate, thorough surveys are necessary to understand the full complexity
of the architectural and engincering information present in a number of prehistoric constructions in
the US Southwest. Many contain features that required extra investments of time and effort (beyond
chat needed to achieve utilitarian goals) that can be taken as a quantitative measure of the importance
ef certain cultural concepts. The presence of such features can be used to map the spread of the
corresponding architectural/engineering concepts. Examples from the Southwest and elsewhere are

political entity through processes involving simultaneous nucleation at the regional, village, and
household levels. A cluster of large defensible Mohawk villages formed west of modern Albany, and
the Mohawks became founding members of the Lroquois confederacy. Epidemics that began in the

subterranean tunnels much like those recorded for a number of historic (e.g., central Eskimo) and

Archaic base camp areas in western Arizona were apparently abandoned or converted to different

[604] LATE ARCHAIC HUNTERS AND FARMERS IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST.

Hunting during the Late Archaic in south-central Arizona was part of a broad subsistence base
reflected in the capture of a wide variety of small and large animals. The introduction of ceramics
and the establishment of the Hohokam resulted in similar patterns of animal exploitation which were
associated with similarities in both social organization and comparable adaptations to a desert habitat.
Both occupations involved smaller populations who had less impact on the environment and animal
resources. Changes in animal procurement that occurred later resulted from shifts in social organiza-
tion developing from a greater commitment to agriculture.

1710] CLOVIS COLONIZATION PATTERNS IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA,

This paper examines the Clovis colonization process by identifying patterns in the diseribation of
stylistically distinct artifacts manufactured from specific lithic material. Colonization is suggested
by four patterns: (1) a limited distribution of artifacts; (2) exploitation of a limited number of resources,
@) the occurrence of chipped stone artifacts on sites located great distances from their saurce areas;
ena (4) a unidirectional movement of lithic material from west-to-east and from north-te-south. These
patterns are not present on post-Clovis Paleoindian sites; they are more dispersed, and djustrate s
troader exploitation of resources, and a bidirectional movement of lithic material over smaller areas.

(203) THE MATERIALIST BASIS OF CULTURE HISTORY.

We explore methodological links between construction within an evolutionary archaeology and
approaches developed by culture historians through seriation. In both approaches, cultural phylogenies
are based on variant frequencies in populations. Time, history, and context are important on an
explanatory level. Yet culture history ultimately was grounded in an essenualist metaphysic, and
enits were perceived as empirical, rather than analytic. Consequently, errors were incorporated into
che way knowledge was structured. Because sources of these errors are identifiable, they are predictable
and avoidable. Understanding the materialist basis of culture history allows discussion of new analytic
emits within an evolutionary archacology.

The Rio Maior drainage in Portuguese Estremadura contains a large number of late Pleistocene
hunter-gatherer occupations, Systematic survey results indicate that these sites are not randomly
distributed. Explaining the processes that created intersite patterns must rely on geomorphological

contemporaneous land use in southwestern France and Cantabrian Spain. This study illustrates the
methodological rigor necessary for any credible settlement system model for the Upper Paleolithic.

[601] THE IMPACT OF EUROPEAN CONTACT ON NATIVE AMERICANS.

This presentation highlights current thinking about the Hispanic-Native American interactions,
particularly from perspectives afforded by the on-going Columbian Quincentenary. Historical and
archaeological data strongly suggest that, contrary to views long held by American historians, Indians
were never merely passive recipients of whatever new practices the Spanish chose to introduce.
Rather, American Indians more creatively adopted and manipulated those traits that proved relevant,
and simply ignored many others. Far from being luckless puppets, Native Americans commonly
attempted to manipulate the rapidly changing conditions to their own advantage, insofar as that was
possible. The cultural instability of the times actually provided opportune for many Indians, both
promoters and adversaries of the Spanish regime.

Settlements called oppida represent the culmination of [ron Age economic and social systems in
temperate Europe. Caesar's descriptions of Gaul have served as models for archaeological study in
central and eastern Europe as well as in France, and the Roman conquest of central Europe has been

~ connected with the end of oppida there. New studies of chronology and spatial patterning suggest
instead that military confrontations, abandonments, and resettlements occurred before invading
armies arrived. Analyses at Manching, Kelheim, and Staré Hradisko show that discontinuities in
settlement resulted from changes in native social and political systems.

The Wickliffe Mounds cemetery was first excavated and opened to the public in 1932. In 1991, the
Wickliffe Mounds Research Center began removing the human skeletal remains from display and
preparing a new exhibit for the same space. The entire process is open to public view, allowing first-
hand observation and free discussion of the procedures and problems. Public reaction among the site
visitors and the regional population has been guardedly favorable. The new exhibit will include
expanded textual, graphic, and audiotape discussions of the burial and looting issue, and the value of
archaeological research in cemetery sites.

SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS IN SOUTHEASTERN IOWA.

This paper presents the preliminary faunal analysis from the Middle and Late Woodland components

Late Woodland locus, with fewer organic remains associated with the Early and Middle Woodland
eecupations. Over 4000 faunal remains were recovered, primarily from pit feateres and midden
deposits. The Late Woodland locus also yielded carnivore coprolites. The qaancity and diversity of
she faunal material is indicative of sedentary occupations with intensive exploitatan of local food
sesources, especially fish, turtles, waterfowl, deer, and elk.

is a long-term study designed to address questions regarding cultural evolution and human adaptation

to a tropical ecosystem. Participants discuss the diverse analytical methods employed, including

paleopathology, agronomy, palynology, energetics, spatial analysis, obsidian hydration dating, and

ethnography. These independent research results are shown to be complementary, thus demonstrating
the value of a conjunctive approach to archaeological research.

603] MODELS AND THEORIES ON THE EMERGENCE OF CULTURAL COMPLEXITY.

Several decades of intensive research on the dynamics of states and complex chiefdoms have

generated important advances. Attention is increasingly focused on models and theories which seek

to explain the emergence of middle-range sociopolitical complexity and ascribed social inequality.

This symposium presents current theoretical developments, critiques of existing paradigms, and

recently acquired data from several regions of the world. Models pertaining to both complex hunter-

gatherer and agricultural societies are featured. Contributions center on the theme: what are the
causes, consequences, and legitimate archaeological correlations of the appearance of complex organi-
zation in prehistory.

[604] SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE IN THE LATE ARCHAIC AND EARLY CERAMIC

PERIODS OF THE SOUTHERN SOUTHWEST.

The late preceramic and early ceramic periods in the southern Southwest witnessed many new
adaptations. These included new land use strategies, generally resulting in decreased mobility, and
the adoption of cultigens. These changes occurred at different times and to different degrees in the
diverse desert environments of the southern Southwest. The papers in this symposium examine these
crucial time periods. They draw on data from different regions and combine land use studies focused
on mobility strategies with subsistence studies focused on the impacts of the adoption of agriculture.
{605] WHO WAS WHO? TRACING ETHNICITY ALONG THE IROQUOIS-ALGONQUIAN

BORDERS IN PREHISTORY.

American archaeologists conventionally assume that discrete ethnic groups may be traced back
into the past by continuities in material culture. Paramount in such endeavors has been the assump-
tion that material culture provides reliable indicators of traditional practice and ethnic continuities.
In the Northeast, the in situ model of Iroquoian prehistory is built on that premise. The northeastern
literature is displaying renewed interest in such questions, and the time is ripe for thoughtful consider-
ation of the fundamentals. The speakers address ethnicity and ethnic signalling around the borders
of the Iroquoian speakers, emphasizing the concepts and reasoning appropriate to the problems.

historical archaeology. Inter-ethnic relations and class conflict are themes that play a major role in

| many of these papers. Relationships among Native Americans, Europeans, and African Americans
are clearly critical for understanding the historic Chesapeake. Class and social conflicts among
economic groups, occupational groups, and regional groups are important as we strive to understand
changing social and political situations, including stratification within cites, between urban and
rural areas, and between the old world and the new.

[607] MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PALEOENVIRONMENTS AND CULTURAL CHANGE:

INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES IN SOUTHEASTERN IOWA.

An interdisciplinary research program is focusing on environmental and cultural changes in a
portion of the Mississipp! Valley in eastern lowa and adjacent areas. Paleobotanical and geomorphologi-
cal investigations have defined trends in local and regional climatic patterns, vegetational changes,
and landscape evolution. Joint geological and archaeological work has focused on alluvial fans as
sources of data on landform development and buried Archaic and Early Woodland occupations. Near-
surface Woodland communities have been intensively investigated. The symposium papers present
the results of this effort to understand both the natural and cultural parameters of the prehistoric
Upper Mississippi Valley.

[608] OPERATIONAL SEQUENCES AND PREHISTORIC TECHNOLOGY.

The 1980s saw the emergence of new theoretical and methodological approaches to the study of
prehistoric techniques by American archaeologists, in part due to influence from European anthropolo-

gists, ethnologists, and prehistorians. The working definition of technology employed by many archae-
ologists has been expanded from the traditional concern with the form and function of artifacts to
include a concern with culturally and historically conditioned choices of techniques and materials,
as well as regional and interregional aspects of raw material procurement. This new way of thinking

about technology is embodied in research that attempts to reconstruct and understand entire opera-

tional sequences from choices of raw material through production, use, and discard. This symposium

presents several examples of progress in this important area of research.

[609] UNRAVELING THE GORDION KNOT: NEW EXCAVATION AND SURFACE SURVEY
AT YASSIHOYUK (GORDION) TURKEY.

The mound called Yassihéyiik has been identified as historic Gordion. Excavation from 1950 to
1973 exposed the Phrygian capital ruled by Midas, destroyed c. 700 BC. Current research 1s focused
on recovery of environmental and economic data within a controlled stratigraphic sequence. Between
1500 and 100 BC, texts suggest Hittite influences, occupation by Indo-European speaking Phrygians,
and conquest by the Persians, Alexander, and the Romans. Qualitative and quantitative shifts in floral
remains, fauna, and material culture provide a new understanding of the changing economic and
political role of the site and its people.
|615] WPA: WHAT PRICE ARCHAEOLOGY?

This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the end of the Works Progress Administration, one of
the most ambitious governmental programs of the Roosevelt years. Despite its impact at the time,
the role of the WPA is little understood today. The Committee for the History of Archaeology sponsors
this session to heighten awareness of the continuing importance of past archaeological work and to
underscore the ways in which records of past work can be utilized. The session explores the WPA
accomplishments, its legacy, and its contributions, both actual and potential, to the discipline of
archaeology. Following the brief prepared talks, speakers and audience will engage in a candid, wide-
ranging discussion.

[701] COMPREHENDING SOCIOPOLITICAL COMPLEXITY: NEW APPROACHES TO TONTO
BASIN PREHISTORY.

The elaboration of sociopolitical structures in the Tonto Basin, Arizona, has been a perennial issue
of regional scope. Until recently, the absence of intensive scientific excavation has limited the debate
to speculation regarding this and the broader issue of the Salado phenomenon. The situation has
changed dramatically as three independent scientific teams have joined in one of the largest research
programs in the history of American archaeology. The teams have very different missions, analytical
orientations, and data bases; nonetheless, they share an interest in measuring complexity and under-
standing its environmental, technological, and social underpinnings. Papers describe the various
approaches to these issues and discuss preliminary findings.

[702] PUBLIC PROJECT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND RESEARCH.

Public archaeology is usually accomplished under a series of management constraints with limited
funding in specified geographical areas. A common complaint is that such restrictions inhibit research
potential and project quality. A number of sound and successful public archaeology research programs
have been accomplished. The results and contributions of these are evaluated and discussed.

[703] FROM BROKEN POTS TO AIRLINE TRASH: RECONSTRUCTING HUMAN BEHAVIOR

Behavioral Archaeology, now about 20 years old, was introduced as a program for the development
of archaeological method and theory. Is behavior an appropriate analytic unit for archaeological
research? What theoretical approaches are most appropriate for reconstructing and understanding
behavior in the archaeological record? Is there a future for a behavioral approach in archacology? In
this symposium, these and other questions are addressed by individuals with diverse experience
and theoretical backgrounds. Through a combination of case studies and theoretical exercises, an
assessment is made of a behavioral approach and recommendations are offered for development or
redirection.

[704] LAND HOLDING, TENURE, AND BOUNDARY MAINTENANCE: ISSUES OF

prehistoric land holding practices and community boundaries. The geographical focus is broad, includ-
ing archaeological and ethnographic research from the South Pacific, the Andes, lowland Mesoamer-
ica, the American Southwest, northwestern Europe, and West Africa, Land holding practices are
discussed in terms of agricultural intensification, access to resources, socio-economic integration,
ancestor worship, warfare, trade, and hydraulic organization. The emphasis of each paper is to link a
well documented archaeological data baseto a theory of how and why people partitioned prehistoric
landscapes.

[608] THE CONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL IDENTITY IN THE EUROPEAN AURIGNACIAN:
FROM THEORY TO PRAXIS.

The study of Paleolithic personal adornment has much to contribute to our understanding of social
evolution, when viewed as a means of constructing social identity. A broad view of the operational
sequence for body ornaments is mandatory and must take into consideration cosmology, raw materi-
als, production techniques, labor input, and socially variable contexts of procurement, production,
use, and loss/abandonment. On-going microscopic and experimental research on a large sample of
Aurignacian body ornaments sheds surprising light on the material construction of social identity
near the origins of durable body omaments.

[108] GENDER CONSTRUCTION AND GENDER ROLES IN A PREHISTORIC SOCIETY: A
CASE STUDY FROM SOUTHERN ITALY.

The paper addresses gender construction and gender roles in some south Italian communities of
the later Neolithic and Copper Age. The evidence comes from hidden ‘underground’ ritual sites
including both natural caves and crevices, and artificial rock cut tombs and hypogea. They seem to
have been used for a range of ritual activities, including burial and other rites of passage, perhaps
including initiation rites into a secret cult society. It is argued that membership was restricted to
males, who wielded power over women through exclusive control of secret ritual (cosmological)
knowledge.

origins for it: puberty initiation rites and shamanistic practices, both of which concerned vision
questing to obtain spirit helpers. The archaeological implications of this evidence are considered in
reference to a neuropsychological model of ASC graphic imagery, rock art styles, the use of style to
define ethnolinguistic groups, and the management of rock art sites.

In spite of some forty years’ attention to butchery studies, and investigations of the economic
anatomy of prey species ranging from kangaroos to penguins, no useful butchery data have been
reported for seals. In an effort to define criteria for interpreting the large, well-preserved Pinniped
assemblages from Thule Eskimo sites in the central Canadian Arctic, an ethnoarchaeological study
was conducted of late winter breathing-hole sealing by Inuit hunters on Baffin Island. In conjunction

‘ with experimental studies of seal economic anatomy, and ethnographic evidence for the existence of
seal-sharing partnerships, this avenue of research could lead to the recognition of socially prescribed
redistribution in the archaeological record of egalitarian hunter-gatherers.

[602] THE PALEOEPIDEMIOLOGY OF COPAN’S LOW STATUS POPULATION.

A paleoepidemiological approach to analyzing skeletons of low socioeconomic status individuals
from Copan involved consideration of reconstructions of prehispanic Maya culture, historical
accounts of disease in the Maya area, the distribution of pathological changes within each skeleton,
and the distribution of disease within the population. Heterogeneity was controlled by dividing the
population into subpopulations based on sex, phase, site type, and site location, Application of the
statistical techniques of survival analysis and log-linear modeling to subpopulation data revealed
where significant differences existed in demography, disease, and evidence of stress. Results contribute
to interpretation of Copan’s population growth and decline.

the main house as season and occasion dictated. Specialized workers (i.e., domestics or field hands}
were economically unfeasible on small slaveholdings like Locust Grove.

[208] LATE ARCHAIC HABITATION FEATURES FROM TWO SITES IN WARNER VALLEY,
OREGON.

_ __ Recent excavations in two lakeside sites in Warner Valley, Oregon, revealed several depressions
containing well preserved habitation features. Excavation exposed four features consisting of collapsed
patterns of burned, linear “logs.” The logs were dated between 730 F1 80 and 440 Fl 80 BP. Sediment

be and artifact stratigraphy demonstrated that the logs rested on possible house floors. This poster
illustrates the excavation, recognition, and interpretation of the habitation features at these two sites.
Similar features have been recorded at sites along Lake Albert, Oregon, and in Surprise Valley,
California. Comparison of these features allows development of a regional model of lakeside settle-
ment patterns in the northwestern Great Basin.

[610] THE PIQUIGUA PHASE: A TERMINAL VALDIVIA OCCUPATION IN NORTHERN

MANABI (ECUADOR).

Regional archaeological survey and deep stratigraphic excavations in the Jama River drainage of
northern Manabi have demonstrated a Valdivia 8 colonization of the humid upland portion of the
valley beginning by 1680 BC. This paper provides an overview of the Piquigua phase at San Isidro
(M3D2-001) and related sites, presenting data on settlement pattern, radiocarbon chronology, agricul-
tural subsistence, ceramic production, mortuary behavior, long-distance interaction, and ceremonial-
ism. Finally, current models of Late Valdivia sociopolitical organization and territorial expansionism
in western Ecuador are reviewed, and the Piquigua phase is examined within this broader, macro-
regional context.

[306] ON THE NATURE OF HIGHLAND-COASTAL SOCIOPOLITICAL INTERACTION IN

THE LATE FORMATIVE PERIOD OAXACA.

Comparative evidence of contact with the developing highland Zapotec at Monte Alban during the
Late Formative period is examined from recent excavations in two regions on the Pacific Coast of
Oaxaca. Shared traits of ceramic style are but the most obvious indicator that the Rio Verde Valley
and the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec had each fallen under the influence of Monte Alban.
Similarities and differences between the two regions in local development and interaction with Monte
Alban are examined to see if any pattern of highland-coastal sociopolitical relationships can be
adduced for this important developmental period.

[501] A NEW PROCEDURE FOR EXTRACTING PHYTOLITHS FROM SOIL.

A variety of procedures exist for extracting phytoliths from soil. Most are based on the principle of
@otation using heavy liquid. However, no comparative data exist on which procedures are most
appropriate for recovering phytoliths in different soils, or if using different procedures alters results.
This paper reports on experiments carried out to improve phytolith extraction. Significant modifica-
sons in common procedures are suggested, for example, in the process of removing certain oxides,
spersion, and in the sequence of processing steps. Results of direct comparisons of phytolith recovery
am diverse soils using three commonly used heavy liquids also are discussed.

10 [705] Innovative Approaches to Cultural Resource Management
|705] INNOVATIVE APPROACHES TO CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN THE

NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.

This symposium addresses methodological and theoretical changes occurring in cultural resource
management in the northeastern United States. CRM as discussed here refers to research, activities,
and programs that seek to conserve, protect, and interpret historic and prehistonc archaeological
resources. The symposium papers reflect the diversity and commonality of approaches to CRM as
represented by “academic,'’ contract, and avocational archaeology, and preservation planning. Topics
include: innovations in sampling and analytical procedures, revised modeling and interpretive frame-
works, recent strategies for site protection and management, effective ways to increase public aware-
ness of and public involvement in archaeological research, and retrospective and prospective evalua-
tive views.

{706] TERMINATION AND DEDICATION RITUALS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD:
INTERPRETING THE GEOGRAPHY OF SACRED SPACE IN ANCIENT MESOAMERICA.
Recent archaeological investiganions of Precolumbian monumental structures have revealed the
presence of patterned assemblages of selected material phenomena. Within a more contextual frame-
work, the authors in this symposium explore the role of ideology in structuring the alteration and/
or deposiuon of these cultural materials. Attention ts focused on the role of these objects in rituals
of termination or dedication in which sacred place was manipulated to activate or contain power.
This ritual complex has considerable time depth in Mesoamenca, from the inception of cultural
complexity through the period of European contact.
{707} CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE US ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS TO NORTH AMERICAN
ARCHAEOLOGY.

The Corps of Engineers has played an active and extensive role in the identification, evaluation,
and management of our nation’s archaeological resources. Considerable archaeological work has been
completed in support of Corps projects nationwide. This symposium draws on the extensive corpus
of archaeological work completed by the Corps and demonstrates, through papers presented by Corps
archaeologists, contract archaeologists, and academicians, the contributions the Corps of Engineers
has made to the science of archaeology. Particular focus 1s given to contributions in the following
areas: geoarchaeology, GIS applications, regional archaeological contexts, and site preservation.
|708] SOCIETAL STRUCTURE: REFLECTIONS IN METAL.

Societal complexity can be characterized by internal and external relationships based on the produc-
tion and exchange of valuable goods. The existence of craft specialists, the hoarding of artifacts, and
the control of their redistribution and meaning by non-manufacturing segments of a population can
assist in the identification of social stratification and cultural contact. This symposium explores how
the production, usc, and exchange of iron and bronze can be used to indicate levels of status within
societies and extent of interactions between communities. The geographic regions to be examined

& are central and northern Europe, Africa, Asia, and North America.
{709] COASTAL FOG, LIFTING: RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF COASTAL
ADAPTATIONS IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND.

New perspectives on prehistoric and early historic period Native American adaptations to the coast
of southern New England are provided from recent archaeological investigations in Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and Rhode Island, Papers in this symposium include analysis of individual site excava-
tions, site distributional studies, ethnohistory, folklore, and paleoecological, paleobotanical, and
faunal research. Many previously “foggy” areas in our understanding of changing adaptations to
coastal and estuarine environments are made more clear” through new discoveries and the diversity
of research approaches used by the authors in this symposium.

[304] EXPLAINING VARIATION IN PUEBLOAN LITHIC TECHNOLOGY: PRELIMINARY
ANALYSES FROM ZUNI, NEW MEXICO.

Much attention has been paid in recent research to distinctions between the lithic technologies of
mobile versus sedentary groups. Differences in such aspects as core technology and the presence of
flake technology have been interpreted as indicative of group location along a mobility/sedentism
continuum. Such analyses often assume that once groups are fully sedentary and focused on agricul-
tural production, variation in lithic technology is minimal. Using materials from Badger Springs in
the Zuni area of western New Mexico, we argue that this simple dichotomy of core/flake technologies
is insufficient to account for the variation exhibited, and offer an alternative framework.

[707] THE EFFECTIVENESS OF STRATIFIED CLUSTER SAMPLING FOR RIVER BASIN
SURVEYS: EXAMPLES FROM SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTH-CENTRAL NORTH
CAROLINA.

Stratified cluster sampling is a standard and widely accepted methodology for estimating site
densities within large tracts of land. This method often is used for projects involving cultural resource
management because it is cost effective and reliable for statistical analysis. This method recently was
used within the Upper Smith River Basin in Virginia and the Rocky River Basin in North Carolina.
The results of these surveys and the usefulness of this sampling method as a resource management
tool are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on the special situations created by nver basin
surveys in terms of the statistical universe and the effects on the interpretations of settlement
patterns.

[602] ARCHITECTURAL ENERGETICS AND THE STRUCTURE OF SOCIAL POWER AT LATE
CLASSIC COPAN, HONDURAS.

A model of sociopolitical relations for the early Maya state of Copan, Honduras, which combines
stratified, ranked, and egalitarian statuses, is described. One means of testing this model—architec-
tural energetics—is detailed. The energetic analysis translates architecture into its energy equivalence
as a means of refining the observation of settlement hierarchies as reflections of relative social
power. The results of this analysis confirm that the Late Classic Copan Maya did establish political
institutions endemic to the early state. Finally, potential applications and refinements to the energetic
method are discussed.

[110] PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT VARIABILITY AROUND PLAYA MARGINS IN THE
JORNADA DEL MUERTO, NEW MEXICO.

Playas have long been argued to play a crucial, if sporadic, role in settlement strategies during the
prehistoric period in southern New Mexico. This paper presents the results of a controlled comparative
study of prehistoric settlement patterns around three playas ranging from 20-585 acres in size.
Analyses rely heavily on reconstructed hydrological fluctuations and dated pollen spectra indicative
of paleovegetation changes. By linking these data with archaeological findings, this study demon-
strates that prehistoric settlement intensity varies directly with the periodicity of wet-dry cycles.

[513] AN ENDURING CULTURAL TRADITION? MICROBLADE TECHNOLOGY IN
NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA.

The recovery of microblades from late site contexts (last 3000 years) in Alaska raises several
questions—is this the result of cultural mixing, are the radiocarbon dates reliable, is it possible that
microblade technology, derived initially from an Asian cultural base 11,000 to 10,000 years ago,
continued into recent times, or has there been a reintroduction from some unknown source long after
the tradition disappeared? The cultural complexes of northeastern Asia, Alaska, and the Northwest
Coast are explored in an attempt to provide insights into the prehistoric contexts and chronology of
the microblade tradition.

[506] ARCHAEOBOTANICAL INDICATORS OF SEASONALITY.

Modern observations on the seasonality of plant resource availability in a region provides critical
background for interpreting seasonal patterns of acquisition in prehistory. Good examples of seasonal

, 12 Adams, Karen R
indicators described in the American Southwest include reproductive parts, vegetative parts, and
cases of plant/insect inter-relationships. Condition of parts, associations of seasonally specific taxa,
and complementarity of data sets can combine to make a strong case that season of acquisition may
also equal season of use. The pollen in human coprolites offers yet another way to evaluate seasonal
plant use by humans.

{704] LAND TENURE SYSTEMS AND PREHISTORIC LAND USE: PERSPECTIVES FROM THE

AMERICAN SOUTHWEST.

Land tenure systems socially mediate human access to important resources, and as such, are
important in any consideration of past human settlement and land use. However, the concept of land
tenure must be differentiated from the archaeological concept of land use. While land use is the actual
modification and utilization of the surrounding environment, land tenure is the system utilized to
gain access to important resources. This paper attempts to bridge this gap between the archaeological
interpretations of land use, and our understanding of land tenure systems, through the application of
cross-cultural observations on land tenure to archaeological data on long-term land use from the
American Southwest.

{211] FLOTATION SAMPLES FROM MEZHIRICH, UKRAINE: A MICROVIEW OF
MACROISSUES.

Analyses of flotation samples from the ca 15,000 BP Upper Paleolithic site of Mezhirich have
produced new insights into site use and occupancy issues. Fine fractions from extramural pits have
yielded worked and unworked wood, concentrations of burned and unburned microtine bones, frag-
ments of ivory, and such exotics as amber and gagat. Furthermore, microlithic debitage is scarce and
suggests in-house lithic production of artifacts. Finally, flotation also produced a variety of plant food
remains as well as a fragment of the oldest cordage yet recovered from the Old World. All these
materials are described and quantified, and their potential significance is addressed in terms of site
use patterns and processes.

~ FLUORESCENCE. |

Intensity of patination (visible surface weathering) has been recognized for some years as a meaning
© — ful measure of relative age in Knife River flint artifacts. The absence of patination 1s not an indicator

of recent age in KRF artifacts. A pilot study of ultraviolet fluorescence shows a strong corrrelation |

between age and intensity of fluorescence in unpatinated and lightly patinated KRF artifacts. This
study, focused on time-diagnostic projectile points from the Lake Ho area in western North Dakota,
offers significant expansion of relative dating techniques applicable to KRF artifacts.

[209] RECENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO THE MAYA E-GROUP PROBLEM.

Maya E-Groups are monumental architectural assemblages considered since the 1920s to have
been used for solar observation. Recent investigations have located at least 14 additional E-Group
assemblages aside from the 29 previously published, Sammer solstice observations at six of the sites
suggest that the accuracy of these observatories may vary considerably. The E-Group problem raises
questions about both the nature of Maya astronomy and the process through which archaeological
hypotheses become accepted as fact.

[305] FORAGING ADAPTATIONS IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL ANDES: 11,000-4000 BP.

Foraging adaptations from | 1,000-4000 BP in the high-elevation environments (3000-4700 m) of the
south-central Andes of southern Peru and northern Chile are characterized by the following general
stages: initial entry, colonization, relative stability, and transformation. Each of these stages 1s

characterized by variability and flexibility in the scale and frequency of residential mobility, size, and
constitution of the co-resident group, change in diet breadth and composition, and relationships with
adjacent populations. The tempo of these observed changes, as well as the causal factors that he
behind them in this mountainous environment, are explored.

610] COLONIALISM, RISK REDUCTION, AND THE YUCATEC MAYA.

Colonialism severely affects the risk reduction strategies of the colonized as a result of the appropria-
tion of land and labor for the production of cash crops. Changes in the Yucatecan colonial economy
produced changes in risk reduction strategies of the indigenous population which are reflected in
archaeological patterns of settlement and household organization. This paper attempts to identify the
principal risks and changes in settlement in the Early Colonial period, marked by demographic decline
and the introduction of cash crops, and in the Late Colonial period, marked by demographic recovery
and the introduction of a market system and cash economy.

WINDWARD ISLANDS.

The post-Saladoid of the northeast Caribbean (Leeward Islands) differs significantly from the larger
Windward Islands to the south (Martinique through Grenada}, which developed the distinctive Trou-
massoid-Suazoid sequence also reflective of mainland interaction. The Leeward Islands may have
been more closely related to poorly known Guadeloupe and Dominica. Population movement between
the Leewards and the Windwards may have been active, and the northeast Caribbean islands may
have served as stepping stones for Taino influences in the Windwards.

[509] EXTERNAL RELATIONSHIPS OF THE NIAGARA FRONTIER [ROQUOIS.

Contacts between groups within the Five Nations lroquois and the Huron Confederacy have been
documented. Contacts between members of these confederacies and other ethnic groups are less well
understood. This paper focuses on clarifying relationships between one of these more marginal groups
(located in the Niagara Frontier region of New York state and most often identified as the eastern
branch of the Erie tribe) with the Seneca to the east and the Ontario [roquois to the west. Both type
and attribute analyses of pottery vessels are used to assist in understanding these relationships. The
presence of many non-local styles of pottery in early historic sites 1s noted and explanations offered.

[511] PREHISTORIC FORTIFICATIONS IN NEW ZEALAND AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF
THE MAORI CHIEFDOM.

Fortified settlements (pa) are key to understanding the development of Maori chiefdoms in late
prehistoric New Zealand. This paper argues that increased need to protect populations, stored food
supplies, and capital investments created the opportunity for elites to obtain greater power. Pa
functioned as a means of protection for populations, but were also a focus for political and social
activity. The model presented regards pa as appropriate indicators of polity identity and size, as well
as the role of Maori leaders.

[307] ONE THOUSAND YEARS OF FISHING: SUBSISTENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON
AITUTAKI, COOK ISLANDS.

Over the last 1000 years, fishing strategies on the southern Cook Island of Aitutaki have undergone
significant change. Early in the sequence there was an emphasis on angling technologies that gradually
gave way to a predominance of netting strategies. This paper explores the process of change in
rerms of effective selective conditions and correspondent variation in local subsistence technology.
Methodological considerations which limit archaeological interpretations are considered for the Aitu-
taki case, The evolutionary path of Aitutaki’s prehistoric inhabitants is compared with adaptations
in other Polynesian settings.

uses analyses of ceramics from sites in southeastern Nevada, northwestern Anzona, and southwestern

of standardization in form and technology. Questions relating to the development of community
specialization and interaction in egalitarian societies are—examined in light of these analyses.
