[69] UTILITARIAN AND SOCIAL ASPECTS OF HOHOKAM RED WARE: RESULTS FROM THE
LAS COLINAS PROJECT
Recent studies of a large ceramic collection from the Sedentary and Classic period site of Las Colinas
have yielded substantive results concerning Hohokam red ware. Excellent temporal control has
permitted the precise reconstruction of developmental trends in the incipient red ware tradition.
Studies of vessel forms, technology and recovery contexts have documented the utility and social
worth of red-slipped pots within the overall pottery assemblage. New ideas are discussed about the
production and use of red ware ceramics in the desert Southwest.

[24] INTRA-POLITY ECONOMICS AT COPAN, HONDURAS
The socioeconomic structure of production and exchange at the Late Classic Maya center of Copan
is considered. An analysis of artifacts relating to construction plaster suggests that control of plaster
rested with the maximal lineage administration. This bureaucratic level is modeled as being secondary
in power only to the central elite within the Maya sociopolitical structure. The control over production
is coupled with that over distribution, with plaster flowing up to the central elite and down to lesser
administrators. This suggests that models must recognize multiple centers of production and spheres
of exchange.

[12] HOHOKAM IRRIGATION SYSTEMS IN THE EASTERN PHOENIX BASIN
Recent excavations between Mesa and Tempe resulted in the discovery and examination of more
than 40 Hohokam canal segments spread over a 3 mile corridor extending south from the Salt River.
Direct dates on canal deposits indicate ages ranging between AD 700-1400. This large sample provides
new information about the engineering characteristics of main and lateral canals situated in near-
and far-river zones. Inferences regarding construction and abandonment episodes, as well as the use-
life of different canals, support a cyclical model of Hohokam irrigation in the Phoenix basin.

[20] WESTERN ANASAZI KIVAS: CONTRASTING PATTERNS IN FORM AND FUNCTION
FROM A.D. 1000 TO A.D. 1500
Analysis and interpretation of changes in kiva form and frequency at sites occupied by prehistoric
pueblo people in northeastern Arizona are the goals of this paper. Between AD 1000-1500 kiva form
changes from circular or D-shaped to rectangular. Concomitant with change in form is an apparent
change in frequency from one kiva for each 2-3 households to one kiva for each 10-20 households.
Interpretation of these patterns involves a synthesis of ethnographic data on kiva use with changing
archaeological patterns of space use within the kiva, within the site and between sites.

[1] PASSIVE RESISTANCE: HOPI RESPONSES TO SPANISH CONTACT AND CONQUEST
Hopi/Spanish contact took place over the course of nearly three centuries (1540-1819). The rela-
tionship between the two peoples changed radically during the period. Blessed by geographic isolation,
the Hopi developed an effective strategy for at first mitigating and later resisting Spanish influence.
As a result, Hopi culture was the Pueblo culture least affected by Spanish contact when relations
developed with the U.S. government in the mid-19th century. This paper combines archaeological
data with documentary evidence to examine Hopi/Spanish relations during and after the contact
period and to explain the Hopi’s successful strategy (termed passive resistance) for minimizing Spanish
influence.

[47] PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM USE-WEAR ANALYSIS ON GROUND STONE TOOLS
Ground stone tools are often considered the ugly sister of the lithic artifact family. Yet recent
experimental and microscopic studies indicate that it may be possible to determine use-wear pattern
differences for specific ground stone tool types. Experiments have been conducted using manos,
metates, hide processing stones, pottery polishers and grooved and flat abraders on wood and bone.
The results indicate that a lot more can be done with ground-stone tools than previously thought.

[20] RITUAL FACILITIES AND SOCIAL INTEGRATION IN NONSTRATIFIED SOCIETIES: A
CROSS CULTURAL PERSPECTIVE
Archaeological investigations of Anasazi architecture generally assume Kivas provided a context
for ritual decision-making above the household level and some domestic scxivities. This paper approaches
these assumptions through a cross-cultural inquiry of socially muegratave architecture among several
non-stratified societies. Questions considered are: L) What partion of he society has access to inte-
grative facilities? 2) What range of activities is carried out in the facilitses? 3) Is the presence/absence
of the facility dependent upon the scale or population of the host coenmnumity? Resulting generaliza-
tions provide a perspective for evaluating possible kiva functions.

[25] THE MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER RADIOCARBON CHRONOLOGY: SOME FACTS
AND FICTIONS
Ever since the publication of the first of the more than 50 impermnally consistent radiocarbon dates
from Meadowcroft Rockshelter (36WH297), controversy has been generated by frequent assertions
that the older than 11,000 BC dates have suffered particulate of nomparnculate contamination. Data
bearing on these assertions are assessed in the light of new accelerator mass Spectroscopy |AMS} dates
provided by Oxford University. The weight of all the data taken rogether suggests that this site still
represents the best dated evidence tor the presence of human beings south of the glacial front in the
Americas. That evidence indicates that Native Amemeans were present in southwestern Pennsylvania
by ca. 15,000 BC.

[44] EXPERIMENTAL KNAPPING WITH KRF AND MIDCONTINENT CHERTS: OVERVIEW
AND APPLICATIONS
An experimental program 1s described which has valved mulnuple technologies and knappers and
more than 300 replications from Knife River flint. Crescent chert and other midcontinent cherts. A
computerized data collection program is described. Data analysis has focused on flaking debris. Four
types of archeological applications are described which involve study of 1) size distribution of flaking
debris, 2) flake typology, 3) flake production rates and production efficiency and 4) correlation between
knapper experience and byproduct characteristics.

j64] JOMON-YAYOTE CONTINUITY: LANGUAGE, CULTURE, POPULATION
This paper contests the popular notion that the <tiuft from hunting fishing and gathering in the
Jomon period to wet-rice cultivation during the Yayoi period was duc to an overwhelming influx of
mainlanders who drove out or absorbed an aborigimal population and implanted the Japanese tradi-
tional culture and people we know today. Histoncal linguistic, archaeological, population and human
skeletal evidence show that the cultural and somatic changes demonstrable between Jomon and
recent times in Japan are not attributable, as conventionally believed in the West, to a revolutionary
migration event shortly before the beginning of the Christian era, but instead to a transformational
process that was under way by middle Jomon tumes and thar has continued to the present day.

[61] GEOLOGY OF THE MILL IRON SITE (24CT30)}, CARTER COUNTY, MONTANA
The site, which contains 11,000 year old artifacts of the Goshen Complex, lies at the crest of a 21
m high, isolated bedrock butte which lies on the northeast margin of the valley of Humbolt Creek, a
northwest draining, fourth-order, meandenng, low gradient, ephemera] stream. Five paired, geo-
morphic surfaces which represent former valley slopes have formed during the past 11,000 years due
to about 25 m of episodic downcutting. The site lies on the highest of chese surfaces. All five surfaces
are underlain by a thin veneer of sandy sediment (principally colluvium) which overlies bedrock. The
thickest accumulation (2.65 m) occurs at the site where the artifacts are contained within sediments
that formed on the margin of a first-order ephemeral stream that formerly drained to the southwest
with a gradient of four degrees.

[30] THE SALADOID OCCUPATIONS OF MARTINIQUE
Saladoid sites on Martinique in the Lesser Antilles have been the subject of archaeological inves-
tigations for over five decades. Mainly the work of local archaeologists, the often incomplete infor-
mation is nonetheless abundant. This paper will attempt to synthesize the accumulated evidence,
complementing the author’s own surveys and collection studies, with an overall emphasis on dating
and cultural classification. Despite the almost total lack of ecological remains (especially faunal), site
distribution and artifact typologies provide significant data on the people's activities and adaptation
to their island environment.

[13] MODELING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TRADE PATTERNS USING GIS SYSTEMS
The purpose of this paper is to model the diachronic aspects of trade patterns using ARC/INFO’s
network system. A large amount of well documented trade goods and ceramics from prehistoric and
historic sites in western New York provides the data base. Alternative trade models are constructed
based upon formalist and substantivist assumptions. These models are combined with the network
algorithms of ARC/INFO to predict the distribution of ceramics and other trade goods. These patterns
are compared with the archaeological record. The use of GIS systems in an evolutionary framework
to model development of trade networks has wide applications to other areas and time periods.

[69] USING ANASAZI REDWARES TO RECONSTRUCT PREHISTORIC TRADE NETWORKS
Anasazi redware ceramics were widely traded from relatively small areas which specialized in their
production. They form one stylistic sequence, but exhibit technological variation due to differences
in resource availability. This variation allows most redwares to be traced to specific manufacturing
areas, a crucial step in the reconstruction of trade networks and alliances. However, because few
archaeologists have worked with the redware production areas, the current typology is misleading
and the redwares are often mistyped. As a result, patterns of distribution and the behaviors that
created them are obscured.

[13] RED FLAG MODELS: THE USE OF THE MODELING PROCESS IN MANAGEMENT
CONTEXTS
An approach to modeling prehistoric site location is presented which is geared for the day-to-day
management of cultural resources. As opposed to sophisticated predictive models which require large
investments to develop and often have limited management application, Red Flag modeling utilizes
the interactive capabilities of a GIS to provide a dynamic analytic tool, The approach emphasizes
sites whose locations are not predictable by a set of environmental variables and provides a series of
steps by which these ‘red flags’ are shifted from being anomalous locations to predictable ones.

[66] PHASING ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES BY COMPUTER: A GRAPHIC SOLUTION
The recording of stratified sites has changed drastically in recent years. This paper presents a 3D
micro-based graphics system developed by the author based on the principles of the Harris matrix. It
displays 1) composite plans from single stratum drawings, 2) 3D models showing the sequence of
deposition of strata making up a phase using single stratum or composite plans as basic data and 3)
colors and shading based on output from databases containing written material, The system saves
manpower and money and reproduces output to plotter, laser printer and camera.

[31] STORAGE, LABOR AND SEDENTISM IN THE INTERIOR PACIFIC NORTHWEST
Archaeologists working with hunter-gatherers have long seen a relationship among storage, seden-
tism and “complex” forms of social and economic organization. The adoption of a storage economy
implies changes in domestically based labor organization. These changes can be tracked through
changing domestic architecture, The Intermontane Plateau of western North America provides a 5500
year record of shifting economic and labor strategies in which storage played a crucial role.

[7] SYMBOLS OF AUTHORITY AT CHICHEN ITZA: PAUAHTUNS AND CAVES
Analysis of the iconography of the architectural sculpture of the major constructions in the heart
of the area traditionally called “Toltec Chichen” at Chichen Itza, Yucatan, Mexico, reveals an
iconographic theme consistent with Classic Maya rather than Central Mexican origin. The major
buildings of “Toltec Chichen” are seen to be aboveground reconstructions at caves, identified by the
presence of Pauahtun figures. Archaeological and ethnological evidence indicate that caves play
important roles in Maya cosmology and ritual as sources of supernatural power. Epigraphic evidence
further supports the assertion that Chichen Itza should be viewed as a unified Maya site.

[64] JAPANESE-LIKE REMAINS IN KOREA: WHAT DO THEY SIGNIFY?
Documentary evidence suggests the presence of a Japanese military/governmental outpost on the
Southern Korean coast in the 4th century AD. Korean scholars have rejected this notion as unfounded,
and until recently there has been no material evidence in favor of the Japanese presence. New finds
of Japanese-like artifacts and features, however, are raising this question again seriously. Korean
interpretations range from postulating trade and interaction to claiming the materials as prototypes
for later Japanese imitation. The range and appropriateness of such interpretations are discussed here
within a framework of state formation with reference to modern national political tensions.

[34] MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC TOOLS: VARIABILITY AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
The meaning of variability in Middle Paleolithic retouched stone tools is addressed in the light of
recent evidence from the Iberian Peninsula. A significant amount of lithic variability may be best
explained by factors other than style or function in the classic sense, including the size dimensions
of tools and the extent and intensity of edge use. Additionally, tools seem more the end result of the
use of their component edges than planned implements for which the makers had ‘‘mental templates.”
The implications of these data for the interpretation of human behavior during the Middle Paleolithic
are discussed.

[34] BETWEEN MICRO AND MACRO: A STUDY IN THE INTERPRETATION OF SMALL-SIZED
LITHIC DEBITAGE
A major part of lithic assemblages recovered today is made up of very small lithic debitage (1 mm
- 2 cm). Despite this abundance, most aspects of the relationship between these small pieces and the
lithic reduction process remain relatively unexplored or intuitively based. In this paper, the authors
investigate and describe the morphological characteristics of small-sized debitage generated by rep-
lications involving three fundamental stages in lithic reduction: 1) core reduction/flake production,
2) tool manufacture/retouch and 3) tool maintenance/resharpening. The results of the study are applied
to an analysis of small-sized debitage recovered from the Upper Paleolithic site of Gruebgraben in
Lower Austria.

[31] REFLECTIONS IN A DISTANT MIRROR: ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR STORAGE
AS AN INDICATOR OF CULTURE CHANGE
Many studies involving the economics of storage are synchronic investigations of the causes for
and nature of the storage practices of a specific group. This paper describes and compares storage
Strategies over several thousand years in the Ohio Valley and examines them as reflective of subsis-
tence, demography and evolutionary level. By tracing the changes revealed in storage patterns through
time in this pivotal area of the Eastern Woodlands, supporting evidence is found for the idea that
regional cultural development did not proceed in an uninterrupted unilineal trajectory of increasing

isolating and emphasizing artifact variability over the site and specifically relating these patterns to
observed spatial distributions of architectural units.

[37] THE “WILD MAIZE” FROM TEHUACAN REVISITED
Recent studies of the earliest maize from two of the Tehuacan Valley cave assemblages indicate
that it represents not wild but fully domesticated maize. This conclusion is based upon comparative
morphological studies of these remains, of extant Mexican maize races and of a number of other
exotic but primitive races. With this dismissal of ‘wild maize” as an ancestor of maize, both Man-
gelsdorf's original and recently revised hypotheses can be shown to lack credibility. Other morphol-
ogical studies of the earliest Tehuacan maize remains provide strong support for IItis’ hypothesis that
the maize ear originated from a male tassel spike and argue strongly against Galinat’s hypothesis that
the maize ear originated form the teosinte female spike.

[9] ANALYTICAL PRECISION AND SENSITIVITY IN CERAMIC ANALYSIS
In order to answer questions of increasingly localized production, the chemical analysis of ceramics
must frequently focus on materials derived from the same geological formations. The success of a
compositional analysis lies not only with well formulated sampling designs but with the nature of
the analytical technique(|s) utilized. Substantive findings from analyses of Southwestern Salado Poly-
chromes, with specific data sets derived from 1) X-ray fluorescence analysis, 2) instrumental neutron

[2] DEALING WITH CULTURAL CHANGE: AN ANALYSIS OF THE DIAZ HOUSEHOLD,
MONTEREY, CALIFORNIA ;
Shortly after the American annexation of California, Manuel Diaz, a wealthy Mexican merchant, ;
was caught in the turmoil of cultural conflict that was to leave him bankrupt by 1855. His plight was ;
common among Mexican-Americans who were systematically discriminated against by the newly :
dominant Anglo culture. This paper analyzes how the Diaz family dealt with the change of government :
and culture by manipulating the material culture of their household to symbolically support or subvert &
the American takeover. The analysis shows that material culture is a complex and active part of
social interaction and cannot be interpreted solely through function or economic worth. ;

[27] RESEARCH PROBLEMS IN THE ARCHEOLOGY OF GREATER SOUTHERN TEXAS
In a recent overview prepared by the authors for the Southwestern Division Corps of Engineers, the
archeology of Greater South Texas was examined in detail. This is the Southwest Division’s Region
3, encompassing three Texas archeological areas: Central, South and Lower Pecos. Our focus in this
paper is the issue of site significance, a crucial problem in all three subareas. It is our argument that
too many dollars are being spent on too many sites. Research funds should be concentrated on those
sites with the potential for answering regional problem oriented issues.

Symbols of status in archaeological household remains are used to show how processes of 1)
interregional exchange, 2) warfare, 3) elite colonization and 4) colonization by whole communities
influenced the development of a Postclassic Maya state. Excavated household remains at the Postclas-
sic Maya site of Canajastc, in Chiapas, Mexico, show changing differences between elite and nonelite
patterns of house styles, burials, artifacts and subsistence remains. Both symbolic and processual
approaches are combined at the level of household analysis in order to explain the evolutionary history

[18] TOOLS, TRAILS AND TERRITORIES
Lithic assemblages created by nomadic and seminomadic peoples contain information about terri-
toriality. Stone tools carried to a site are made from materials obtained prior to the occupation of the
site. Therefore, analysis of the geologic provenance of stone that occurs in a site allows one to read a
record of group movements that occurred shortly prior to the occupation of the site. When traditional
routes are known, the level of information that can be obtained is extraordinary. This mode of analysis
is applied here to the protohistoric Wichita Indians of Kansas.

[66] EVENT TREE ANALYSIS AS A TOOL FOR THE STUDY OF HUNTING SYSTEMS
Event Tree Analysis - ETA - is an operations research technique that determines the possible
outcomes of complex systems. It also calculates their probability of occurrence and so is used by
engineers and managers to assess the operating characteristics, potential problems and probable results
of industrial systems. Application of ETA to ethnographically reported hunting systems shows that
it can as well provide a means of analyzing and modeling preindustrial technologies. This paper shows
how hunting systems can be studied as event trees and discusses the problems and potentials of
applying ETA to archaeological problems.

[59] THE TAPHONOMIC TRIO: MECHANICS, ENERGETICS AND ECOLOGY
Traditional! archaeological taphonomy views bones as physical objects prone to various mechanical
forces to assess processes of site formation. Interpreting hominid behavior additionally requires
archaeological bone to be viewed as former packets of nutrients differentially attractive to carnivores.
Bones also contain ecological information relevant to establishing the context(s) within which hom-
inid behaviors were conducted. The reconstruction of hominid lifestyle is suggested to be most
productive when the three taphonomic aspects of bones play their respective parts in concert.

[56] THE “DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH” IN THE EAST AFRICAN PASTORAL NEOLITHIC ;
The introduction of domesticated livestock to East Africa offers new opportunities for the estab-
lishment of redistributive economies and hierarchical societies with “decision-making elites.” Pos-
sible indications of these structures are seen in the distribution of highly valued goods in residential .
areas and cemeteries, goods which include cattle and obsidian. The value of obsidian was especially 7
high in areas remote from the sources. Both obsidian and cattle appear in more or less uniform 1
distribution at Pastoral Neolithic sites, even those remote from obsidian sources. Moreover, most +
practices are essentially egalitarian. Thus, Pastoral Neolithic sociopolitical structure was more likely
to have resembled the “Complex Tribe’ model than a chiefdom, and this paper explores some possible
explanations.

This paper examines changes in the structure of food storage management in the North Alaskan
Inupiat Eskimo village setting resulting from the late 19th century development of the Euro-American
commercial whaling industry. The socioeconomic role of the umialik (whaling captain) as keeper and
redistributor of the community's stored whale meat was vital to the social reproduction of traditional
Inupiat society. By the mid-1880s, the Euro-American commercial whaler had supplanted the umialik
as the chief provider of the community; the umialik became a middleman in the whaler’s employ.
This change in the social role of food storage management was an integral component of capitalist
development in late 19th century North Alaska.

Pastoralism, like foraging, requires mobile strategies for resource exploitation. Until recently,

of site visibility and consider the degree to which off-site archaeology is a necessary alternative for
examining pastoralism in the archaeological record. Pastoral exploitation of critical resources such
as water and pasture will be examined in relation to the cognitive spatial organization of pastoral
settlement and dispersal patterns. The modification of cultural landscapes by pastoralists through the
construction and use of trails, enclosures, encampments, markers and grazing territories are discussed
as an alternative to the ‘pastoral site’.

[38] PREHISTORIC EXPLOITATION OF FRESHWATER BIVALVES IN NORTHWESTERN :
AMERICA
Middens of freshwater bivalve shell occur in archaeological sites throughout northwestern America, :
but little information has been obtained from these middens because the shells are unsuitable for
analysis by standard techniques. Lacking substantive data on bivalve use, archaeologists have long
assumed that shellfish were expoited primarily in late winter on an emergency basis. A new technique
has been applied to 86 shell samples from 16 sites in Washington and California dating from 8000 to
100 BP. The results show that time-honored assumptions about the role of bivalves are seriously in ‘
error. There have been marked temporal and geographical differences in the timing and intensity of
bivalve exploitation which correlate with environmental conditions and/or overall adaptive strategies.

[58] HIGH DENSITY DISTRIBUTIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY: A MEDITERRANEAN
PERSPECTIVE
Surveys monitor variable artifact distributions, but the use of such data to define “‘sites” is often
idiosyncratic, confuses method with interpretation and makes objective comparisons of results from
different regions difficult. However, the high artifact densities usually considered as sites 1) can only
be defined relative to the entire regional artifact distribution, 2) represent palimpsests, themselves
subject to geomorphological and behavioral alterations and 3) cannot provide adequate information
for reconstructing total settlement systems. New work in Greece, where densities are typically high
and artifacts very diagnostic, shows promise of solving some of these logistical difficulties.

[22] ON HISTORY, POSITIVISM, AND THE POLITICAL USES OF ARCHAEOLOGY
For the past 25 years archaeological theory in America has functioned in a distinct political context
which exists within the academic world and in society as a whole. The theoretical construct of logical
positivism and the rationalist belief in the possibility of a true science of the past have influenced
public, academic and political thinking on the relevance of archaeology to contemporary social
experience. Explicitly historical concerns, disdained by most archaeologists since the 1960s, should
not be considered antithetical to the relevance of archaeology nor to the rigorous analysis of archae-
ological data.

[64] PREHISTORIC DIET IN JAPAN: ISOTOPIC EVIDENCE
Samples of human bone from a number of sites in Japan, dating from the Early Jomon through the
Edo and Modern Ainu Periods, were subjected to stable isotopic analysis to estimate diet parameters.
Results indicate that Jomon Period diet varied more between sites, and included more marine species
at coastal sites, than in subsequent periods. Yayoi people used fewer marine foods, even in coastal
locales, and intersite variability in diet was lower than in the following Kofun and Historic Periods.
A number of sites show evidence of two groups of consumers differing significantly from each other
in diet.

[48] AN ANALYSIS OF ARCHITECTURAL FUNCTION AT PACATNAMU, NORTH COAST,
PERU
The Chimu (AD 1000-1400) occupation of Pacatnamu, a site on the North Coasr of Peru, is
characterized by a series of truncated pyramids (huacas}. Each huaca is associated with a compound
of remarkable architectural complexity. The function of these compounds is examined in order to
consider social organization. Alternative models of social organization are proposed, each with distinct
implications for how the compounds would have been used. Architectural function is assessed in
terms of two sets of complementary data: the conclusions of formal architectural analysis and the
results of archaeological excavation.

[65] ARCHAEOBOTANICAL APPROACHES TOWARDS MODELING SUBSISTENCE CHANGE
The maintenance of an agricultural subsistence system demands the creation of spatial microen-
vironments stable enough to ensure crop survival on a regular basis. In the American Southwest crop
survival is dependent upon the location of fields in areas with sufficent water and nutrients, an
adequate growing season and protection from crop predation. The climatic perturbations recorded
during the Anasazi occupation of northwest central New Mexico were of sufficient magnitude to
have affected tactics by agriculturalists to ameliorate the severity of the changes. These tactics were
changed through time and space and were to some extent population dependent. In this paper I will
discuss how some of these tactics might be detected in the archaeobotanical record and how this
record might be improved by particular sampling approaches.

{17] INDIGENOUS LOWLAND MAYA NUCLEATION — AN ETHNOHISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE

Contrary to earlier models of settlement dispersion, recent archaeological work has shown that
settlement nucleation was a factor of Lowland Maya settlement patterns from at least the Late
Preclassic onward, and not a late imposition by outsiders as was once thought. The existence of such
an indigenous pattern among the Lowland Maya inevitably raises questions in regard to the social
role which nucleation played in the evolution of Lowland Maya society. While the ethnographic
record does not provide a direct, easily recognizable analog of earlier nucleated communities, it can
be a valuable source of information relative to the manner in which the Maya themselves viewed
social space and their own communities.

[7] ON THE SIGNIFICANCE OF OFFERTORY RITUAL AT THE SACRED CENOTE

During cight centuries (AD 750-1550) at Chichen Itza two distinct and sequential offertory com-
plexes were focused on the Sacred Cenote. Both were tied to major calendric observances, but the
first (ca. AD 750-1150) involved the offering of the valuable persona! belongings of lineage chiefs and
the weapons of a warrior elite in the name of Toltec cultural tradition. Later poorer offerings (ca. AD
1250-1539) of dynastic emblems, idols, copal and textiles were exemplary of a provincial Maya society
preoccupied with local concerns. There were continuities between the complexes, but the break is
more remarkable.

As the Maya and Mexican influenced architectural styles at Chichen Itza are now considered

However, the association of Mexican style or costume and martial imagery with the north, in contrast
to Maya costume, fertility or dynastic imagery, and the south, characterizes not only the planning
and decoration of Chichen Itza's two major downtown complexes, but also the painting and sculptural
decoration of Late to Terminal Classic temples elsewhere, notably at Teotihuacan and Cacaxtla. Some
explanations for this widespread association of style and symbolism will be explored.

not, however, necessarily result in a significant increase in the degree of political centralization. The
largest production center (Bandjeli) apparently never became a chiefdom and is better viewed as a
complex tribe. The Bassar chiefdom itself (which did not include Bandjeli) was a late development
and may have been defensive in origin, that is, a secondary chiefdom.

[26] THE DECORATIVE BURDEN: MEDIA SHIFTS AMONG POTS, BASKETS, CLOTHING,

As durable and common residues, ceramics govern much of what archaeologists claim to know
about the recent human past. So subtly pervasive is the reliance on ceramic evidence that it casts an
interpretive spell over much prehistory. Often plain pottery marks “dullard” cultures while “fancy”
ware incites interest and large literatures. Here this implicit interpretive convention is examined in
light of ethnographic (Chachi) and archaeological evidence from the Cayapas basin of coastal Ecuador.
Results suggest that a focus upon pottery alone - simply because it is there - will not advance
archaeological understanding of decorative elaboration. Many media, some having only indirect
representation, must also be considered.

[29] THE OCOS CULTURE IN UPPER CENTRAL AMERICA: NEW EVIDENCE ON ITS NATURE
AND DISTRIBUTION
The Ocos and related Barra cultures (ca. 1700-1300 BC) represent the beginnings of sedentism,
agriculture and the ceramic traditions of southern and isthmian Mesoamerica. Recent discoveries in
Chiapas and Guatemala have changed our view of the nature and economic base of this culture.
Meanwhile, new discoveries in Guatemala and El Salvador have shown that this early village culture
had a vast distribution. This paper discusses such new evidence, explores its significance and describes
ongoing research on the Ocos culture.

[47] TWO NEW APPROACHES TO PREPARING UNALTERED ORGANIC MATERIAL FROM
PREHISTORIC BONE FOR ISOTOPIC ANALYSIS
The use of organic matter extracted by conventional methods from bone as substrates for isotopic
analysis can lead to artifactual data. Two new methods, one involving isolation of organic material
protected from chemical oxidation by bone mineral and the other involving the use of enzymes, are
shown to produce material whose shemical and isotopic compositions indicate the absence of post-
mortem contaminants. The use of materials produced from prehistoric bones using these methods as
substrates for isotopic analysis will lead to more reliable dietary reconstructions and more accurate
radiocarbon dating.

[11] WISCONSIN’S BURIAL SITE PRESERVATION PROGRAM

As of 1987 Wisconsin state law protects all human burial sites on both public and private land. The
State Historical Society is responsible for identifying and cataloging all burial sites. Decisions on
whether burials may be excavated and their final disposition are decided on a case by case basis by
the State Historical Society. Problems being addressed include the drafting of administrative mules
defining who may claim interest in a burial and testing nondestructive methods for identifying and
defining limits of burial areas.

Over 90 crania from Windover contained intracranial soft tissue. In better preserved specimens

dental ‘wear and tear’ as indicated by degenerate joint disease, fractures, infection, activity related
dental attrition etc. provide indications of biological cost. By attempting to correlate diverse lines of
evidence, the analysis of skeletal remains provide an important clue to the biocultural adaptation of
an Early Archaic people.

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CHANGE IN FRENCH IRON AGE SOCIETIES

Changes in the indigenous Iron Age ‘tribal’ societies of France following contacts with the expanding
Mediterranean states (in the form of trade in wine) are poorly explained by the traditionally employed
concept of ‘Hellenization’. Rather, a consideration of the possible social uses of imported wine in
indigenous contexts (e.g. mobilization of labor through work-party feasts, competitive manipulation
of hospitality) and their ramifications in producing changes in social relations enables a more cogent
assessment of the processes of economic and political change engendered by these trading contacts.

Abaj Takalik, on the Pacific piedmont of Guatemala, was occupied from the Middle Preclassic
through Postclassic periods. With both Olmec and Early Maya sculpture, the site is recognized as
crucial to our understanding of the development of hieroglyphic writing and major Preclassic Mesoam-
erican art styles. Yet little is presently known about Abaj Takalik’s ceramic sequence and intercon-
nections with other sites. The 1987 summer laboratory season at the site resulted in a preliminary

[52] THE CHANGING NATURE OF STATUS GOODS IN INTERCULTURAL EXCHANGES
Identifying elite status markers often is a difficult task. It may be especially difficult in intercultural
exchanges where the basic problem of synchronic variation (elite vs non-elite) is compounded by
diachronic changes in both the exchange situations and the trade goods themselves. Using late
prehistoric/early contact period Hawaii (1778-1830) as an example, this paper examines: 1) the nature
of material trade goods themselves, particularly elite status markers, 2) the social and symbolic
implications of such goods and 3) the context of these intercultural exchanges.

Detailed spatial analyses of Koster site structure indicate substantial changes in hunter-gatherer
site use and organization occurred during the Middle Archaic. Social responses to increased risk
associated with shifting subsistence opportunities are postulated to have resulted in these changes
and increasing sedentism. Analyses of lithic, floral and faunal distributions, in conjunction with
geomorphological and feature data, illustrate a hypothesized pathway to sedentism at Koster and
permit refinement of existing horizon assignments in terms of site type and structure. Using Koster
as a model, regional level questions of settlement strategy are addressed.

The spatial distribution of artifacts and features provide important evidence in the study of social
organization and economic intensification. General expectations for spatial change within settlements
under agricultural intensification are tested with an early Anasazi (ancestral Puebloan) example.
Findings include Basketmaker III residential/domestic areas smaller than earlier Baketmaker II areas.
Hearths and trash deposits decrease in number and diveristy. There is increased storage space and
some individually larger storage units. Storage unit locations north or northwest of the pithouse are
a subset of BM IJ locations northeast, north or northwest of the pithouse. By contrast, hearth locations
become less patterned.

[57] PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD
Analysis of botanical materials from archaeological sites provides basic data in the form of resource
tabulations. Although biases are acknowledged in the formation of this record, it is usually assumed
that sufficiently large samples provide insight into representative resources at a site. It is a further
inferential leap to equate recovered resources with either production at that site or with extra-local
acquisition, We must attempt to develop criteria for distinguishing evidence of production from
consumption in the archaeological record if we are to effectively investigate problems such as resource
specialization, trade and redistribution. These distinctions can be approached through direct evidence
of productive activities and through circumstantial and comparative argument. Illustrations are drawn
from Hohokam contexts in southern Arizona and elsewhere in the Southwest.

Mineralogical and chemical analyses have demonstrated that Little Colorado White Ware was

out the Little Colorado River drainage follows a pattern of relatively high concentrations in areas
where both cultural and environmental boundaries coincide. Interpretations of this distributional

exchange system. Finally, a discussion is presented concerning how a regional perspective can be used
to enhance the value of museum collections for informative public exhibits and further archaeological
research.

In less than one generation after the fall of Tenochititlan in 1519, Spanish reconnaissance had
extended to the northern reaches of the Pimeria Alta (southern Arizona). Descriptions of native
peoples provided by the early explorers and missionaries do not correlate well with traditional
archaéological reconstructions of late prehistoric culture patterns, leaving the question of cultural
continuity an open one for the prorohistoric period {AD 1540-1700). Recent archaeological and his-
torical investigations will be utilized to outline more clearly the transition from the late prehistoric
to the early historic period in southern Arizona.

delineation of regional settlement and exchange patterns among Chacoan sites located both within
and outside of Chaco Canyon. Detailed analysis of the associated road system has contributed to the
refinement of growth models and chronological issues. Continued analysis of architecture, features
and artifacts associated with Chacoan communities should provide greater insights into the growth
and structure of the regional system.

[18] TEMPORAL AND GEOGRAPHIC VARIATIONS IN SUBSISTENCE PRACTICES FOR

PLAINS VILLAGERS IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS

Investigations at Southern Plains village (AD 900-1450) sites have documented a subsistence pattern
based on corn horticulture, gathering of wild plants and hunting, primarily bison and deer. However,
comparisons of western Oklahoma villages revealed geographic and temporal! differences in exploi-
tation activities. A greater dependence on bison and other prairie resources was evident at villages in
the western mixed grass prairie, whereas floodplain forest resources predominated at villages in the
eastern tall grass prairie. Although no increase in corn horticulture was found, bison utilization
increased through time. Environmental changes and increased availability of bison may account for
the shift in exploitation strategies. =

[24] SOCIAL PROCESS AND THE MAYA COLLAPSE: THE CLASSIC BALKANIZATION OF THE
SOUTHERN LOWLANDS
The Maya collapse can be seen as the disastrous climax of the progressive balkanization of the
Southern Lowlands during the Classic Period (AD 250-950). Political fragmentation is believed to
have provided an initial vehicle for the widespread growth of the ruling nobility. It is argued that such
atomization eventually reduced the resource base of the average city-state and left the overall system
without coordinated management. The resultant decline seems to have contributed to the ultimate
disintegration of the elite culture. Thus, the social processes and other conditions that encouraged
ongoing subdivision were probably major factors in the Maya collapse.

{58] FORMATION OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD AND THE NOTION SITE
The notion “site” plays a crucial role in almost all archaeological activities. In most roles, it 1s
assumed that sites are empirical entities relevant to archaeological concerns. It 1s shown that sites
are not empirical entities but rather constructions of archacologists. When the archaeological record
is viewed as a sedimentary deposit, the multiple origins of artifact clusters are readily demonstrable.
Further, many of the legitimate functions now lumped in the notion site are isolated,and suggestions
for their treatment are made.

the basis of architecture, site layout, ceramics and association with a road segment, This paper

classification based solely on architectural style. Explanations for observed architectural change and
the timing of the growth of the outlier communities are also considered.

[55] IMPORTS AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF ROMAN RURAL HOUSEHOLD RITUALS
Roman rural society is often seen as a combination of export oriented, self sufficient estates, slaves
and rural poor. However, recent excavations have shown a range of rural household types, all pos-
sessing quantities of imported goods. The display and consumption of these goods were part of complex
rituals of status affirmation. This need for imports underlines the complexity of Roman rural economy
and society. These points are illustrated by detailed analysis of material found at a luxury villa in
Etruria and a “middle class” site from southern Italy.

informs us on the causes and consequences of warfare and political centralization and fragmentation

[58] THE RESOLUTION AND EQUATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOGRAPHIC
SPACE AND TIME
Archaeologists tend to overlook major, obvious discrepancies in their basic assumptions until the
last possible moment. That moment may finally have arrived for many of our assumptions concerning
the bounding of “sites” and “activity areas” in space, a topic of current interest to many. In this
presentation I focus on the fact that space as an archaeological dimension is inseparable from time.
Changes in the ways we interpret archacological space require basic alterations in the ways we think
about and “‘use’”’ time as well. Serious consideration of the resolution and bounding of archaeological
space and time cast doubts upon their equatibility with ethnographic space and time,the possibility
of direct reconstructions and the appropriateness of archaeological data as the basis of formulations
of culture history and other pseudo-evolutionary scenarios.

[58] LOST IN SPACE: LINKING LITHIC TECHNOLOGY TO PREHISTORIC LAND USE
At present traditional subsistence data dependent on settlement sites are extremely rare for the

to alter the highly speculative nature of current reconstructions of economic organization. An alter-
native approach, focusing on variability in the differential discard of artifacts, is presented and
illustrated by the Roystone Grange Project, Derbyshire. Beyond simply collecting data on a different
scale, however, inferences about activities depend upon the development of appropriate theory linking
the character of stone tool production, use and discard to the structure of behavior within the landscape
as a whole.

[72] MINIMAX MODELS AND HUNTER-GATHERER DIET RECONSTRUCTION
Models have a heuristic value as solutions to archaeological problems of diet reconstruction. Recent
subsistence models of hunter-gatherer populations have, however, been severely criticized for 1)
assumptions regarding human decision-making (i.e., optimal foraging), 2) neglect of the division of
labor and 3) insufficient recognition of the importance of plant resources in the diet. In this paper the
merits of minimax and Bayes-minimax strategies are explored and a multistage modeling program is
outlined. The model is specifically concerned with predicting the evolution of a mixed subsistence
strategy, taking into account risks associated with low payoffs, a divided labor force and cultural
ecologically estimated quantities of plant and animal use.

[25] DATING HOHOKAM CANALS BY THE ARCHAEOMAGNETIC METHOD
Over 50 archaeomagnetic samples from Hohokam canals have been analyzed for their remanent
magnetic directions in an effort to assess the potential of their detrital remanent magnetism to serve
as a method for directly dating canal sediments. While controlled experiments investigating the
origins, precision and accuracy of detrital remanent magnetism in canal sediments need to be under-
taken, preliminary tests are encouraging. In some canal systems, precise results (alpha 95 less than
5.0 degrees) appear to be the norm. Further, calculated virtual geomagnetic pole (VGP) positions appear |
to be accurate when plotted against master curves derived from the thermal remanent magnetism of
independently dated fired clay sources.

OF HUMAN REMAINS
Three types of agent are morally relevant to the exhumation of human remains: the dead, their
living descendants and archaeologists. The types are identical in essential characteristics, but different
in accidental ways. By virtue of their essential identity, the agents have identical kinds of rights and
duties, but accidental features impose specific duties of beneficence on each type of agent. Duties of
beneficence may actually compel archaeological exhumation under certain conditions, while respect
for the dead may prohibit it under other conditions.

Small pottery vessels (called ‘‘tripods” or “qltars’’) are recovered from Neolithic sites in Southeast
Europe and are reported variously as lamps and censers but without strong contextual data to support
these terms. Replicative experiments were undertaken to answer questions concerning manufacture
and usage using data from the site of Sitagroi (Greece] as a model. Results indicate 1) one routine is
relatively effective in forming and firing, 2) mechanical contingency can be cited as cause for one
particular breakage pattern among several in the archaeological sample, 3) use as a lamp is not
supported and 4) use as a censcr 1S possible. The replicative experiments allow for interpretations of
manufacture and possible function.

MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD COMMUNITIES IN ILLINOIS
Extensive excavations at several Mississippian Period sites in the American Bottom, Illinois, have
permitted a delineation of the internal organization and functioning of peripheral communities (sites
without mounds), including the definition of discrete residential farmsteads as well as special function
features. The latter, which occur infrequently, include structures interpreted as sweatlodges, a public
structure and a temple/mortuary complex. They were presumably important elements of community
integrating functions. Taken together, this diverse array of features represented a series of dispersed
villages, the overall distribution of which was strongly influenced by local topography. This settlement
model is compared with contemporaneous settlements elsewhere in Illinois.

[3] FOOD SHARING IN THE PALEOLITHIC: REFITTING CARCASSES AT PINCEVENT
Refitting of lithic debitage and hearth stones provides equivocal evidence for contemporaneity and
sequence of occupation for several hearths at one level of the Magdalenian site of Pincevent. While
these kinds of materials exhibit the potential for reuse over long periods of time, the meat, marrow
and other edible byproducts of reindeer carcasses brought into the site are much more limited in their
usable life span. Refitting of bones is used to evaluate questions concerning 1) contemporaneity of
the occupation of hearth complexes and 2) patterns of carcass distribution among commensal units.
Sharing of carcasses is suggested by the distribution of pieces of individual animals.

[2] ARCHAEOLOGIES OF RACISM AND RESISTANCE IN BRITISH COLONIAL AMERICA
The formulation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries of essentialist, biogenetic concepts
of race were closely linked to elaboration of explicitly racialist, as opposed to religious and political-
economic, justifications of slavery. Post-processual analysis must examine: 1) the processes of differ-
entiation whereby hierarchical dichotomies such as race and gender become “naturalized”, 2) the role
of spatial control in the maintenance or challenging of hierarchy and 3) the possible co-occurrence of
hegemonic and counter-hegemonic conceptions of space and their preservation in the archaeological
record. These issues are addressed through reanalysis of several colonial period sites.

[4] EARLY URBANISM, RURALISM AND SOCIAL COMPLEXITY IN SOUTHWESTERN ASIA
Early complex societies in southwestern Asia commonly are stereotyped as “urbanized.” Regional
| measures of social complexity (e.g. n-tiered settlement hierarchies} emphasize similarities and obscure
structural contrasts berween these societies. Alternatively, urban communities can be defined as
those that expanded beyond agricultural self-sufficiency. Urban and rural site size classes are proposed
for ancient southwestern Asia based on ethnographic and textual data. Comparison of settlement
patterns shows that, while urban nucleation characterized Mesopotamia, “rural complexity” in the
southern Levant was based on proliferations of diversified villages. A paradigm of nonurbanized
complexity can be considered for other geographical regions as well.

[53] ANALYSIS OF PREHISTORIC HOHOKAM LAND USE PATTERNS: CONVERGING LINES
OF EVIDENCE FROM NON-SITE ARCHAEOLOGY
Interest in Hohokam agricultural systems has led to an increased awareness of information found
in areas away from habitation sites. The possibility of agave cultivation has emerged as a significant
aspect of this research. Archaeological investigations of land use patterns were recently conducted
on one of the last remaining undisturbed sections of the Salt River terrace near Phoenix. Analysis of
land resources, paleobotanical materials, excavated features and artifact distributions from a con-
trolled collection within more than 126,000 square m all combined to suggest an array of activities
were carried out in this ‘non-site’ context. Results of this analysis are presented along with a per-
spective on methodological issues directed at non-site phenomena.

[26] A TECHNOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON CHANGES IN THE ANCIENT OAXACAN
GREYWARE CERAMIC TRADITION
The Valley of Oaxaca (Mexico) has had a long prehispanic sequence of reduced pottery which is
antecedent to the region’s renowned contemporary black ware. Though generally plain, this prehis-
panic ‘gris’ ceramic tradition underwent several significant changes in surface finish, thickness and
paste composition. A series of preliminary analyses, including petrography and firing temperature
experiments, were employed to identify more precisely the technological parameters of these ceramic
shifts. Given these analytical and other findings, interpretive attention is focused on the often
controversial Classic-Postclassic transition in ‘gris’ plainwares.

[53] WOOD REUSE IN PUEBLOAN ARCHITECTURE: EVIDENCE FROM HISTORIC ZUNI
SETTLEMENTS
Patterns of wood reuse in puebloan architecture are investigated using more than 500 tree-ring
dated pieces of structural wood from Zuni Pueblo and three historic Zuni farming villages. Patterns
in the shapes of date distributions are identified for individual roofs, buildings, stockpiles of construc-
tion timbers and settlements. The interpretive model presented by Ahlstrom (1985) and analysis of
historic photographs are used to identify reused beams versus initial construction and repair beams.
The effects of several variables on beam reuse are assessed including wood species, beam size, beam
function, room and site function and construction rates.

[57] HOHOKAM PALEONUTRITION AND PALEOPATHOLOGY: A SEARCH FOR
CORRELATES
Recent study of Classic Period noncremated skeletons provides an opportunity to study the rela-
tionship between Hohokam paleonutrition and paleopathology. Several interpretive problems are
identifiable. Foremost among these is that most of the so-called nutritional lesions observed in these
remains reflect childhood rather than adult stress episodes. Additional analyses involving adult
remains are thought necessary before a more accurate assessment of the Hohokam dietary regimen
can be based on osteological evidence.

[35] MODELING THE TRANSITION: A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS
Strong parallels as well as significant differences can be found in the archaeological record of
transition from mobile hunting and gathering economies to sedentary food production in arid North
America and the Middle East. In each area models have been proposed for processes leading from one
classificatory endpoint to the other on a scale of transitional progress. Many of the same criteria are
employed for judging the position of assemblages, sites or archaeological cultures along this scale,
with similar lack of consensus among Old World and New World researchers. Problems of confir-
mation and refutation for alternative positions as well as promising new approaches are discussed.

{6] EVOLUTION AND INTEGRATION OF A MULTI-SITE COMMUNITY IN THE HOHOKAM
CLASSIC PERIOD
In the northern Tucson Basin of southern Arizona two earlier settlement clusters coalesced in the
Classic Period to form a single multi-site community covering 146 square km, A platform mound
site was centrally located within this integrated complex spanning basin floor to mountain flanks.
Levels of productive specialization and some comsumptive patterns have been demonstrated that are
commensurate with a strong network of exchange. Large scale settlement data have produced quan-

[71] TIME AND TEMPER MEETS TREND AND TRADITION
Subregions within the Midsouth have often presented a confusing picture of diachronic changes in
temper and decoration. The two attributes have been regarded as having moved as a unit. It now
seems, however, that tempering and surface finish functioned separately, radiating from different
geographic localities. Clay tempering apparently spread north and west throughout the region, while
cord-marking spread south into the areas, as Caldwell had earlier proposed. An accurate dating of
these phemonena transforms a large body of hitherto indistinct pottery into accurate temporal indi-
cators.

[75] FAUNAL REMAINS AT ENGLISH CAMP, SAN JUAN ISLAND, WHERE “SEASONALITY” IS
AN ETHNOGRAPHIC TERM
Questions archaeologists tend to ask about faunal remains from Northwest Coast sites center on
seasonality and assume that season of resource procurement and season of site occupation are one
and the same. Questions about seasonality stem from one view of the ethnographic record for the
region and ignore ethnographic information that illustrates the potentially complex nature of the
archaeological record for subsistence. A second glance at the ethnographic record and the history of
European contact in the Northwest indicates that other questions may provide more insight into
prehistoric subsistence strategies. Faunal remains from the English Camp shell midden, excavated as
part of the San Juan Island Archaeological Project provide one set of data to address questions about
faunal resource procurement, use and disposal.

and Cucurbita rind, but little maize, serving as evidence for food production.

Recent theories of precapitalist state formation generated in Marxist and idealist traditions have
focused on reproduction as a central arena of social conflict or accomodation. This paper addresses
two problems with many of these theories: 1) the assumption that activities associated with women
are primarily reproductive and 2) the presumption of omnipotence and consistency on the part of
emerging civil authorities. The dialectic of kinship and gender in class formation are explored as
means of orchestrating production and reproduction and as the foci of efforts by civil authorities to
control producing communities. Regionalism and ethnicity are frequently created in the process and
become arenas of cultural forms of resistance. 7

The variability that characterized Indian participation in the Spanish colonial economy 1s still
poorly understood. Although some forms of participation are well documented, little is known about
native populations whose involvement in the colonial economy went beyond cither subsistence
agriculture or dependence on large Spanish enterprises. In the colonial Province of Soconusco |south-
eastertNew Spain], native participation in the colonial economy was somewhat unique because the

Indians controlled the production of cacao, a commodity that was in great demand in the international

market. Archaeological and documentary data provide both complementary and contradictory evi-

Soconusco.

The political basis of the social florescence of the “Wessex Culture” of late 3rd/early 2nd millennium
southern England has long been debated by archaeologists. The appearance of great wealth in some
of the mortuary assemblages, along with the labor intensive construction of tombs and, most signif-

researchers to consider the society a “paramount chiefdom.” However, other scholars have viewed
these manifestations to be the work of “tribal confederacies”, while still others hedge altogether on
the nature of Wessex political organization. This paper examines the extant data for this organization
in light of the concept of the ‘Complex Tribe” in order to shed some new light on this interesting

m of alluvium. Some exhibit pedogenic properties. Two contrasting reconstructions can be suggested:
1) paleoenvironmental uniformity throughout this interval but with soil formation only where and
when waning sedimentation locally provided surfaces for pedogenesis and 2) multiple phases of soil
formation connoting changing environmental conditions and paleoclimatic periodicity. Either inter-

Soils are not uncommon in archaeological contexts and are normally studied with classical labo-

micromorphology - the study of soils and loose materials in thin section - is an effective means to
tackle such problems, Examples of micromorphological applications to soils and sediments from
archaeological sites in the Middle East and Europe illustrate how palaeoenvironmental and site

The large Late Neolithic communities of the central Balkans have often been characterized as

However, there is little evidence for the redistribution of locally produced goods (such as ceramics)

from the region and will discuss the relationship between subsistence and exchange. It will show that
there was little exchange between major highland/lowland communities in animal or animal products.
Instead, there appears to be evidence for such exchange between major centers and satellite settle-

[66] IMPLICATIONS FOR DIRECTIONAL CHANGES IN SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES OF
SPATIAL PATTERNING AT SOLVIEUX
Central to the interpretation of spatial patterning in Upper Paleolithic sites are models of human
induced material patterning derived from ethnoarchacological work. Much of this work suggests that
material near hearths reflects intensive OF repetitive activities while material distant from hearths
reflects more dispersed (or extensive) activities. This dichotomy and predictions based in Binford’s
collector-forager subsistence continuum have been used to suggest directional changes in subsistence
organization across the Middle/Upper Paleolithic boundary. Solvieux level M, an Upper Perigordian

[48] DIET. ARY VARIATION ON THE SCALE OF THE SOCIAL GROUP: AN EXAMPLE FROM
THE PREHISTORIC SITE OF PACATNAMU, PERU
Research at the prehistoric urban center of Pacatnamu, located on the north coast of Peru, focuses
on understanding subsistence practices during the Chimu occupation of the site. Concepts derived
from evolutionary and ecological theory are used to examine general subsistence at the site in
comparison to other contemporaneous site types. The research goes beyond the generalized compar-
ison by examining diet at Pacatnamu on a much finer scale: the social group. A stratified sample of
pyramids, with associated room groups, Was excavated to test the approach and determine specific
dietary variation between social groups at Pacatnamu. Architectural and artifactual data were used
as socioeconomic indicators, while floral and faunal remains were collected, analyzed and quantified
in order to define dietary diversity. The research provides 4 much more detailed understanding of
subsistence in Andean South America in particular, and complex societies in general.

[38] SUBSISTENCE STRESS IN NATIVE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA: KUMEYAAY ADAPTATION
TO EUROPEAN CONTACT AT WIKALOKAL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY
That the Eurpoean presence in native America impacted indigenous groups dramatically is a well
| known fact. Less well known are the ways in which these groups adapted to multiple stresses wrought
| by this presence. With archaeological data recovered from Wikalokal (the Buckman Springs Site), we
| endeavor to explain Kumeyaay adaptation to subsistence stress using the economic principle of
marginal cost. As access to resources became increasingly restricted and competition for resources
increasingly stringent, the Kumeyaay, traditional hunters and foragers, relied more heavily on foraged
foodstuffs.

Chemical and metallographic specimens were taken from 33 edged iron tools and weapons dating
from the late 9th to 12th centuries AD. All are from well stratified and dated levels from the
excavations at Dublin, Ireland. The dominant manufacturing technique was the welding of marten-
istic steel to ferrite in one of two ways. In both cases, the martensite was used for a cutting edge,
while the ferrite was used to protect the brittle steel. Comparisons with other contemporary metal-
work are made. The chemical data are used to elucidate some possible origins of the iron ore.

Systematic excavation of the Great Moshier Burial Site was undertaken in 1979 and 1987. The

anti-science of, the last five hundred years. Normally, atlases make native peoples in colonized
landscapes either passive or invisible, suggesting that colonialism is inevitable. Examples from museum ;
exhibits and disciplinary practices are used to reveal aspects of the normal atlas. Simultaneously this
atlas is rewritten to admit native resistance and to indicate how native peoples made their own :
histories, expressing them through material culture. Thus this anti-atlas of the relations between

with a ratio between plant productivity and biomass. Relatively when and where increased dependence
on cultigens occurred is retrodicted and evaluated for the southern Southwest.

[19] VARIATION IN MISSISSIPPIAN MAIZE PRODUCTION ACROSS ENVIRONMENTAL
GRADIENTS: SITE CATCHMENT ANALYSIS
It is generally believed that Upper Mississippian economies were less dependent upon maize
| agriculture, and more dependent on wild resources, than Middle Mississippian economies because of
marginal growing conditions for maize. This environmental hypothesis has never been adequately
rested. As a first phase in testing this hypothesis, site catchment analysis is performed on Late
Woodland-Mississippi period sites in a transect encompassing several environmental gradients stretching
from southern Illinois through Wisconsin. Results indicate that although there are differences in
potential resource exploitation from south to north, the differences are not necessarily consistent
with the environmental hypothesis.

A number of flintknappers have questioned whether billet flakes are distinctive or can be accurately

of the percussor dramatically affects the ratio of platform size to flake size, as well as other flake
features. We conclude that where bulbar areas are preserved it should be possible to recognize soft vs.
hard hammer flake origins. This enables archaeologists to address a wide range of theoretical questions
regarding cost advantages and disadvantages of soft hammer flaking and the conditions under which
it is likely to be used.

on associations between samples and defined social units, the nature of economies guarantees that

INTERPRETATION OF THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS
An archeological overview of the Southern Great Plains, including portions of Colorado, Kansas,

patterning in research intensity, data recording and type of research. Indicators used to evaluate these
functions are numbers of recorded sites, National Register properties and excavated sites. The utility
of thes¢ indicators is discussed tor identifying research needs and goals and documenting historical
changes in research. The information derived can be used to design research and management programs

The lack of burins and complete absence of any metal tools in prehistoric Aleutian archaeological
sites has puzzled archaeologists since these sites are known to have large bone and wood industries
with many incised and elaborately decorated bone and wood artifacts. Use-wear examination of nearly
2000 stone tools from the Chulka site on Akun Island in the Aleutians has ied to the discovery of a
large number of previously unidentified gravers. These were expedient tools made very simply on

[10] SOLL FORMATION, TIME AND ARCHAEOLOGY
Soil development requires some time to elapse so the effects of climate, plants, animals and relief
can modify the parent material. Because of this soils are useful as age indicators. Moreover, soils in a
sedimentary sequence mark the passage of time between depositional episodes under conditions of
landscape stability, whereas sediments (the soil parent material) may have accumulated quite rapidly.
This is exemplified at the Lubbock Lake Site (Texas plains) and Wilson-Leonard Site (central Texas).
This situation probably obtains at many other sites and can profoundly influence interpretations of
cultural chronology.

Pollen analysis of a column from the Windover Site provides new data on early Holocene vegeta-

to ca. 3-4000 years BP. After 3000 BP there is a return to more forested conditions. Additional taxa
appear in the more recent past. Paleoenvironmental interpretation, combined with other data (coprol-

The “complex tribe’ closely resembles a “chiefdom” but is distinguished by the absence of evidence

craftsmanship, long distance trade, differential wealth or settlement patterns which indicate popu-

At the outset of Spanish settlement in California missions were not considered economic entities,
rather they were founded to convert, protect and civilize the California Indians. The analysis proposed
here is based on an economic variable common to all California missions, one that was instrumental
in changing the focus of mission settlement. My thesis is that surpluses arising from Indian labor
were initially allocated to the task of encouraging more Indians into the mission, but in time these
surpluses were allocated to endeavors that supported the missions as commercial enterprises.

painted pottery and agriculture many centuries earlier than previously suspected in the region.

MANUFACTURE IN SOUTHWESTERN ARIZONA
Recent excavations at pre-Classic period Hohokam village sites within the Vekol and Santa Rosa

production occurred and focused on a single ornament type made from a single shell genus. The
organization of production appears to have involved a village industry in which multiple households
participated in shell ornament manufacture for use in networks of interregional interaction.

[8] CROPS COME TO THE DESERT: LATE PRECERAMIC AGRICULTURE IN SOUTHEASTERN
ARIZONA
By the beginning of the Late Archaic Period (1000-500 BC}, groups substantially dependent on
agriculture occupied the arid and semiarid river valleys of southeastern Anzona. Architectural, botan-

support this proposition. The implications of this dependence are examined in light of theoretical
expectations for the adoption and spread of agricultural systems, and are also compared to current

While previous investigations of prehistoric canals have included particle-size analysis, the resulting
data have been limited to confirming field descriptions with little consideration of process. Prelimi-
nary results of recent particle-size analysis of Hohokam irrigation canals and associated soils indicate
other applications. Particle-size distributions help define active vs post-abandonment sediments
which is essential to defining artifact context. Empirical critical velocity data used in conjunction
with particle-size data qualify discharge retrodictions derived from open channel equations. It 1s
recommended that sediment sampling not be restricted solely to channel proveniences as adjacent
soils can contain textural facies related to canal operation.

Mobility strategies of hunter-gatherer groups in desert lake settings is currently of considerable

biomes for hunter-gatherers. Thomas (1985) has offered two alternative strategies which might have
operated in the vicinity of such lacustral systems: limnosedentary and limnomobile. Archaeological
research at two Late Prehistoric sites in Utah Valley, Utah, suggests the hunter-gatherers who lived
here were following 4 limnosedentary strategy- Evidence includes a wide array of artifacts and bone

[58] CHRONOLOGICAL RESOLUTION IN DISTRIBUTIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY
As distributional perspectives shift from sites to landscapes, many routine chronological approaches
emeet with difficulties. While it is often concluded that dense artifact accumulations in spatially
constricted settings represent temporally limited events because of spatial association, when artifacts
are sparsely distributed over a wide area, contemporaneity can no longer be based on that criterion.
However, there is little comfort in only suggesting that a landscape has a long history of use when
cultural change is of interest. This paper presents approaches for chronological resolution in nonsite
studies using archaeological case examples from southeastern Oregon and eastern Nevada.

mobility is no longer feasible, not when it is no longer needed, with concomitant changes in socio-
political organization. The archaeology of western Nevada, where a post-1500 BP shift toward more
sedentary use of marsh resources occurred, is used to illustrate the argument.

of Poverty Point were, in fact, a mosaic of differing levels of complexity; the society never attained

describes the different structures of social complexity which were manifested in the Poverty Point
culture.

[31] A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY THROUGH THE FORMATIVE
Transformations in the organization of Formative” agriculture in Mesoamerica resulted in a major
shift in the use of portable ceramic containers and underground storage facilities. By the onset of
“Classic’”’ times both the tecomate vessel form and bell-shaped pits or cists are a much reduced feature
of the archaeological record. Environmental, demographic and land use factors are examined in light
of what they can tell us about storage and culinary practices in the early farming villages of Meso-
america. The inverse relationship between the intensity of agriculture and the presence of tecomates
and underground storage facilities is discussed.

[54] BEADS FROM HELO’
Most beads recovered from excavations at Helo’ are types made and used during the early coloni-
zation of California. The most common types of shell beads underwent regular changes between 1769
, Kohl, Philip L. 107
and 1804 when most of the occupation occurred in the vicinity of recent excavations. One change
involves the replacement of stone drills by iron needles. The other change 1s an increase in the average
diameters of the beads, The bead collection from Helo’ contributes to the refinement of the chronology
of these changes. Knowledge of these changes enables the dating of features and site areas at Helo’.

{72] VARIATION IN LATE PREHISTORIC “ONEOTA” PLANT USE IN THE UPPER MIDWEST
Comparison of the archaeobotanical floras of various late prehistoric Oneota sites suggests that the
intensity of maize agriculture was not uniform and that considerable regional variation existed in
plant procurement strategies. Although intensive maize agriculture apparently gave rise to elaborate
ridged fields in southeastern Wisconsin, plant remains from the central [llinois Morton Site reflect
an economy based on the utilization of a broad spectrum of wild and cultivated plants including nuts,
fruits and native starchy-seeded cultigens such as knotweed, chenopod and little barley.

[6] THE ORGANIZATION OF PREHISTORIC VILLAGES IN THE CIBOLA AREA OF THE
SOUTHWEST
In the Cibola area villages display configurations ranging from dispersed pueblos with several rooms
to ridgetop roomblock clusters that may include 25 roomblocks, 440 groundfloor rooms and a great
kiva to large planned pueblos with up to 800 groundfloor rooms. Settlement pattern, architectural
and excavation data are employed with ethnographic data from Zuni to evaluate organizational models
associated with the differing community forms. It is suggested that strong networks of social relations
that crosscut kin ties are required to make the larger villages viable and that lack of these networks
may account for the apparent instability of the earlier large pueblos.

{67] AN INVESTIGATION OF PREHISPANIC COMMUNITY STRUCTURE: MATACAPAN,
VERACRUZ, MEXICO
Past attempts to develop models for the archaeological identification of residential space have
fecused on activities within the household compound. While valuable, these models present signifi-
cant logistical difficulties for archaeologists interested in community-wide patterns of residence.
More recent ethnoarchacological investigations, focusing on the use of space and the resultant pat-
terning of material residues of the entire houselot as a unit of analysis, may provide a more efficient
means of examining community structure. These models are applied to data gathered through a
systematic intensive surface survey of the site of Matacapan on the Southern Gulf Coast of Mexico.
The results of this investigation are presented and critiqued.

a secure world of positivism to an uncertain relativist universe of post-modernism, suggesting that

[40] THE RURAL-URBAN AXIS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF THE TIWANAKU STATE
Interdisciplinary research over the past two years in the immediate rural hinterland of Tiwanaku
has begun to clarify the nature, intensity and organization of regional settlement in that ancient
Andean state. This research suggests that human populations and their productive capacities in the
Tiwanaku hinterland were administered in a hierarchical fashion through the medium of \imposed)
urban or urbanized centers. A sharp analytical distinction between household production and corpo-
rate production with separate emphases and forms of organization in the Tiwanaku state appears
justifiable. This paper analyzes the structural differences embedded in these two forms of the orga-
nization of production and their relevance to understanding the nature of the Tiwanaku state.

manufactured in infinite variety by artisans during the Classic Teotihuacan Period (ca. 50-750 AD)
in the Mesoamerican Meseta Central. As a chronological “marker” of Teotihuacan culture and
influence, these portable, “personal” censers were used to bum the resin copal, presumably during
rituals or ceremonies. Found in surface collections and excavations in urban and rural sites, candeleros
have never been adequately reported (cf. Seler, Gamio, Linne, Sejourne, Noguera, etc.). The results of

[19] LATE PREHISTORIC CORN HORTICULTURE AND SOCIOCULTURAL SYSTEMS IN
SOUTHEAST MICHIGAN

Increased importance of com horticulture during the last 1000 years of prehistory in southeast

Michigan involved changes not only in subsistence activities but also in community and regional
| sociocultural systems. These changes can be understood in terms of the operation of a hierarchy of

regulatory subsystems. Subsistence decisions and practices act on environmentally based corn yield

uncertainty. Remaining yield uncertainty and other variables are operated on at the community and

is evident in settlement pattern, mortuary treatment and stylistically encoded information.

[7] IDENTIFICATION OF LINEAGE MEMBERS IN THE ART OF CHICHEN ITZA

Many painted and relief figures at Chichen Itza are said to depict confrontations between generic
“Mayans” and Mexicans”. An analysis of costumes and name signs identifies some Mayans specif-
ically by lineage and may help to explain some of the geopolitical referents of Chichen’s imagery. A
reexamination of the Temple of the Warriors suggests that its imagery addresses a conflict between
two Mayan families, the Cocom and the Tutul Xiu, for political power in Postclassic Yucatan. This
accords with recent explanations of Chichen Itza as a Mayan entity rather than a Mexican conquest
state.

[7] EPIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE FOR POLITICAL CHANGE AT CHICHEN I[TZA

In the hieroglyphic inscriptions of the southern lowland Maya sites, individual rulers record the
outstanding events of their lives, such as birth, heir designation, accession and conquests, in order to
legitimize their right to rule. At Chichen Itza the life histories of individuals are never documented.
Instead, the proposed rulers are often recorded as participating in contemporaneous events, most
likely the dedication ceremonies for the structures on which they appear. It is demonstrated that the
pattern of recording these dedication ceremonies implies differences between the political structure
of Terminal Classic Chichen Itza and the Classic southern lowland sites.

[23] PREHISTORIC ESKIMO WHALERS IN THE ARCTIC: BABY SLAUGHTERERS OR INNATE
ECOLOGISTS?

Two series of bowhead whale skulls were measured in 1977-78 at prehistoric Eskimo sites in the
Canadian and Siberian Arctic. Both show a predominance of infants and juveniles, which is consistent
with ethnographic data and local tradition. Similar patterns are evident for prehistoric harvesting of
ezay whales off Chukotka Peninsula. Whether the selective hunting of calves was ecologically dis-
ruptive or was an efficient form of game management remains a matter of considerable controversy.
Finally, features of Eskimo whaling strategies and whale bone utilization have parallels among Upper
Paleolithic mammoth hunters of the Central Russian Plain.

{13} GIS ALGORITHMS, ANALYSIS PROCEDURES, AND REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL
SPATIAL ANALYSIS

GIS in raster format provides a powerful analytical tool for regional archaeological investigations.
Exvironmental terrain features often are thought to have influenced the placement of prehistoric
activities in a region and GIS can be used to obtain a variety of environmental data at known prehistoric
activity locations. These data then can be subjected to various forms of analysis or modeling to seck
essociations between, or to test hypotheses about, prehistoric activity placement and environment.
This paper examines the nature of some fundamental GIS algorithms and how they can influence
analysis results. Examples are taken from several GIS based studies.

Fire-cracked rocks are probably the most common artifacts in Pacific Northwest sites. Yet, the
physical and chemical properties used to identify fire-cracked rocks are poorly defined by archaeolo-

would indicate that the rocks were derived from local sources, transported by humans, deposited in
fire-cracking environments and fractured and oxidized by fire-cracking activities. Reconstructing the
depositional history of possible fire-cracked rock from the English Camp midden on San Juan Island,
Washington, found that commonly used fire-cracked rock attributes are not reliable and attributes
hesed in sedimentological terms offers a viable definition.

The seasonal gazelle and onager kill at Abu Hureyra (Syria) suggests that these species were

The mass-kill strategy appears to have been stable and productive. The mass killing of gazelle at the

replacement of gazelles by caprines at Abu Hureyra. A causal link between these two events is

| Spain”. To later Euro-American arrivals the region became known 4s "the Greater Southwest”. The
Hopi are among several Native groups who have persisted through these and even earlier incursions
(e.g. migrations of Southern Athapaskan speaking peoples into the area). While European perceptions
of the area and its inhabitants have differed due to political and geographical orientations, Native
perceptions of Europeans, since first contact experiences, have remained rather constant. This pape
will consider Native perceptions as strategies for understanding and coping with alien population:
and influences.

[47] THE IDENTIFICATION OF POTTERY PRODUCTION LOCATIONS BASED ON
ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
Archaeologists rarely find pottery production locations and have attributed this dearth to 1) th
small percentage of each site excavated, 2) the propensity to ignore the space around the site and 2
the tendency to excavate domestic and public buildings rather than industrial zones. Recent eth
noarchaeological research among Filipino and Cypriot craft specialists reveals that production area
. contain few elements which would be preserved archaeologically or identified as potters’ tools. Mo:
tools are perishable or reused objects. The multifunctional use of space and lack of long-term ra
material storage are also factors.

900 BC-200 AD. It will be noted that this is a tertiary development of agriculture with such coming
very slowly and late, 900 AD, in part because of a primary desert efficient subsistence system and in
part because of the rich uncircumscribed resources of the Rio Grande. Although incipient agriculture
and domesticates were known for millennia (at least 3000 years), it is only with a worsening of
climatic conditions (700-900 AD) and increasing population and other factors that they take it on at
all in this region. This evolution shall be contrasted with that of the Oshara-Anasazi tradition in the
Rio Cuervo region where a quick secondary development took place for other causes. With these two
hypotheses about why agriculture came about in the Southwest in two sub-areas, speculations will
be offered about why it happened in the Mogollon and Hohokam sub-areas.

[75] MICRODEBITAGE ANALYSIS OF LITHIC MATERIAL IN A NORTHWEST COAST SHELL
MIDDEN
Recent work on microartifacts has indicated the potential of small sized objects in archaeological
research. Comparison of macroartifact and microartifact distributions from a Northwest Coast shell
midden site provides information regarding lithic manufacturing activity. When large concentrations
of microdebitage and macrodebitage are found together, and macrodebitage consists of non-utilized
debris, the deposit is interpreted as an area where lithic manufacturing took place. When microdebitage
concentrations are low, and macrodebitage is restricted to utilized and broken lithics, the deposit is
interpreted to be an area where use-related activities occurred. Such interpretations are supported by
faunal remains and macroartifacts.

from Hispanic population and supply centers and devoid of sources of great wealth, between 1535

evaluation of long distance trade indicates that centers in Chaco Canyon were not closely tied to a

[36] THE EFFECT OF INTERCOMMUNITY CONFLICT ON THE ADAPTIVE STANCE OF A
LATE PREHISTORIC MIDWESTERN POPULATION
Archaeologists tend to concentrate on the natural environment when assessing the adaptive stanc
of organizationally simple societies, minimizing the effect of the social landscape on their long-terr
success. An Illinois Oneota skeletal series illustrates the importance of considering the social as we
as the natural environment when studying tribal level societies. This population experienced contit
ual raiding resulting in the violent deaths of one-third of all adults. Social predation evidently affecte
their ability to fully exploit the abundant natural resources of the region. This contributed to
comparatively low level of community health, as indicated by hard tissue markers of disease stress

[65] THE CONSTANT AND THE VARIABLE IN ANASAZI DIET
In discussing changes in Anasazi diet, there has been a tendency to view agriculture as an invaria
suite of strategies. Cultivation is, however, extremely variable. Prehistoric dietary change is unde
stood only by breaking it down into its constituent parts. Various data sets are considered to mod
change in Anasazi diet. I argue that while maize is the constant cultigen on the Colorado Plateau |
at least AD 500, the nature of agricultural techniques and the use of naturally available resourc
varied tremendously. Factors responsible for this variation are specified.

The earliest evidence of prehistoric contact between Ecuador and the North Coast of Peru dates

from Guadalupe Ruin and other sites indicates this pattern was established during or only shortly
after the initial rise of Great Pueblos in Chaco Canyon and that throughout their histories Chaco
outliers were closely related to organized developments in the Canyon. Nevertheless, occupants of
outlying Chaco towns had a material culture (ceramics) like that of the regionally differentiated
village populations. This paper will examine the character of this settlement system and its signifi-
cance in understanding the Chaco Phenomenon.

20] RITUAL, EXCHANGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF REGIONAL SYSTEMS
The importance of ritual in integrating Southwestern societies has long been recognized. From
Steward’s study of room:kiva ratios to more recent studies, we have examined the frequency of ritual
structures to infer aspects of community organization. Less frequently addressed has been the impor-
tance of ritual in the initial development of larger regional networks of exchange and alliance. The
latter topic will be addressed using data from the northern Southwest as well as comparative infor-

The prehistory of the Valley of Atlixco, in the western part of Puebla, has until recently been
virtually unknown. Research during the past 18 months by the University of the Americas and the
Centro Regional de Puebla (INAH) has identified what appears to be a small Xolalpan Phase Teoti-
huacan administrative center located along a major communication route linking the Valley of Puebla-
Tlaxcala with the fertile lowland regions of Puebla and Morelos. The nature and chronology of the
Teotihuacan presence in this “core-margin” area will be discussed.

[1] THE SPANISH COLONIAL SOUTHWEST: NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR OLD DOCUMENTS
The traditional approach to the discussion of the Spanish presence in northern New Spain, indeed
in all of the Americas, has been from the viewpoint of institutions—presidios, missions and haciendas.
A contemporary approach, however, that might serve the historian, anthropologist or archaeologist
: better is the comprehensive analysis of primary documents. Too much previous research has been
restricted to specific monographs and extensive generalizations. Modern information technology can
now aid the social scientist in crafting descriptions that will be of major service to archaeological
searches and interpretations. .

[22] JACQUES LACAN, PSYCHOANALYSIS, RADICAL EPISTEMOLOGY AND
ARCHAEOLOGY
One of the first principles of the positivist epistemology for archaeology is a sharp break between
; the observing subject and the object of observation. A keystone of many radical epistemologies is a
; dissolution of this boundary. A central problem then becomes avoiding analytical paralysis in a
morass of relativism. One set of solutions is to examine rigorously and self-reflectively the conditions
which impinge upon perfectly objective observation. When what impinges is social and involves class
relations, one productive perspective is the political philosophy of the Frankfurt School, When what
impinges is inside the observer and personal rather than social, psychoanalysis is called for. Thus the
focus of this paper is on Jacques Lacan, his reformulation of Freud and the value of Lacan to archae-
ology.

Ax Initial Period (1800-900 BC} prehistoric state on the north coast of Peru is examined in light of
cecent investigations conducted in the Casma Valley. Excavated evidence, especially from the site of
Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke, the earliest planned city in the New World, suggests that early state

distributions allow for a more detailed evaluation of the cultural history of the region. This paper
addresses the issue of regional development rather than the diffusion of pan-Mesoamerican traits.

Experimental research is presented focusing on Sullivan and Rozen’s (1985) debitage typology and
archaeological pattern recognition. Implications for the use of the typology are considered in light of
the effects of variable raw material types and technologies, size sorting and trampling. It is argued
that minimally, the addition of a simple size variable to the typology is critical for its use in identifying
processes affecting debitage assemblage content. Conclusions are drawn regarding the relationships

ARCHAEOLOGY
Oral history frequently plays a significant role in the identification and interpretation of historical
sites. It can supplement a spotty documentary record in identifying occupants or functions of specific
features, or place poorly documented sites in the broader context of local economic and social history.
Data from the 19th century town of Paradise Valley, Nevada, suggests expanding the focus from oral

perceptions of the past to bear on the historical archaeology of the town, significantly expanding its
possible interpretations.

pieces, distributional differences by species and skeletal element and relationships of conjoined groups
to spatially fixed features reveal a pattemmed or “‘staged’’ movement of body parts among feature
centered activity areas. These indications of organizational contemporaneity suggest a single occu-

The relationship between subsistence food storage structures and mobility strategies, as it appears

ethnographic data show that food storage pits are used for a variety of reasons (general storage,
concealment, processing) by groups with a wide range of mobility strategies (pomadism, seminomad-

the point where over 2200 people attended during the Open House weekend in 1987. Questionnaires
were distributed and we have collected information about who attends these events and what attracted
them there. We have also experimented with allowing the public to participate in the excavations

[6] HOHOKAM TRIBAL INFLUENCE IN THE SOUTHWEST
The Hohokam were organized as tribes during the Colonial and Sedentary Periods. Studies of
households and public facilities in pre-Classic villages suggest the operation of a moiety-like dual
division related to social and ceremonial functions. The emergence of these units at AD 800 provided
an integrative mechanism not based on kinship and helped to reduce the centrifugal tendencies of a
clan based society. On this basis the Hohokam constructed a massive irrigation system, maintained
large and stable villages and extended their influence as far eastward as New Mexico. More complex
(chiefdom-like) forms of organization develop during the Hohokam Classic Period, but the successes
of the early Hohokam exemplify the strengths of tribal society, demonstrating that complex achieve-
ments are not always a function of complex organization.

At Cerros, Belize, the identification of primary depositional contexts and activity areas and a

these termination rituals served to increase, as well as validate, the importance of extra-kin, publically
oriented activities during the Lowland Maya transformation from chiefdom to state. Thus, they seem

[76] DOMESTIC ANIMAL USE IN THE CENTRAL ANDES: EARLY INTERMEDIATE PERIOD
TO LATE HORIZON
Faunal remains from households of the Early Intermediate Period to the Late Horizon reflect animal
utilization as agriculture intensifies. As more plant foods dominate the subsistence of the Sausa,
animal foods change from a reliance on llama and deer to an increasing use of alpacas, suggesting the
continual use of llamas to transport agricultural products combined with a growing textile industry,
Animal burials throughout 2000 years reflect the importance of various species. Expanding state and
imperial herds under different administrative controls have little effect on domestic meat consump-
tion. Only the contributing species change.

[10] SOILS AT PREHISTORIC AGRICULTURAL TERRACING SITES IN NEW MEXICO AND
PERU
Ancient farming sites offer an opportunity to observe long-term effects of agriculture on soils and
landscapes. Two studies of prehistoric agricultural terraces in semiarid mountainous regions are
presented to illustrate different long-term impacts of agriculture on soils. Soils cultivated between
about 1000 and 1150 AD near the Mimbres Valley, New Mexico, still exhibit degradation, including
accelerated erosion, compaction and losses of organic matter and nutrients. In contrast, soils cultivated
during the past 1500 years or more in the Colca Valley, Peru have enriched fertility and favorable
physical characteristics because of traditional soil management practices.

[67| CRAFT SPECIALIZATION, REFUSE DISPOSAL, AND THE CREATION OF SPATIAL
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORDS IN PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA
Recent work on craft specialization has focused on variability in assemblage content and assemblage
location as a basis for reconstructing facets of the economy of large urban centers in prehispanic
Mesoamerica. Much of this work assumes that the contexts where assemblages are found represent
the location where they were produced. Recent studies of site formation processes, however, show
that the manner in which solid waste is disposed of is highly variable, depending on factors such as
site population density, the availability of suitable dumping areas, the type of material discarded and
the scale of the industry. Failure to take mode of waste management into account can therefore lead
to faulty conclusions about the structure of urban economies. This problem is illustrated with case
examples from Central Mexico, the Maya lowlands and the South Gulf Coast.

[34] PRODUCTION FOR EXCHANGE AMONG PREHISTORIC HUNTER-GATHERERS OF THE
SAVANNAH RIVER VALLEY
Social complexity is a function of the scale and organization of production. Among so-called
egalitarian societies, production is organized domestically, with products valued for use, not exchange.
Conversely, production for exchange is indicative of extralocal nonegalitarian relations which in
eastern North America are well established by 4000 BP (e.g. Poverty Point). Fifteen hundred years
earlier in the Savannah River Valley, certain individuals manufactured bifaces at an unprecedented
scale. Based on the debitage and manufacturing failures at one of their production locations, the
product output of their activity 1s calculated and this scale suggests that tools were produced for
exchange. The implications of their activity for ensuing patterns of Late Archaic economic intensi-
fication are discussed.

[31] THE ROLE OF FOOD STORAGE IN LONG-TERM LAND USE CHANGE ON THE
COLUMBIA PLATEAU
Two fundamentally different models of long-term land use change have been proposed for the
archaeological record of the Columbia Plateau. One model postulates that “collector-like” systems,
with substantial dependence upon food storage, would have been present from initial occupation of
the region by humans. A second model proposes that early Holocene land use systems were “forager-
like’, in character with minimal dependence upon food storage. This model recognizes the initial
evidence for “eollector-like” land use systems in the middle Holocene, with intensified storage
dependence through the late Holocene. These contrastive models are examined to illustrate current
methodological approaches to determining the nature of storage dependence in the archaeological
record.

Subsoil lamellae are thin iron and clay enriched bands bracketed in Late Quaternary sedimentary
sequences throughout the world. Their geographic distributions are not governed by any single obvious
«svironmental or climatic parameter. Often they occur as stacked bands, and in such contexts they

[4] ROMAN IMPERIAL EXPANSION AND THE PRICE OF COLONIALISM: AN EXAMPLE
FROM ROMAN BRITAIN
Roman expansion into Western Europe from the Ist century BC to the ist century AD combined
military strength with economic motives, one of the most important of which was the need for an
increased grain supply. Cost-benefit analysis of colonial expansion shows that a favorable balance
must be achieved between the political and military costs of conquest and the economic return. With
these variables a model for predicting the success of any particular colonial acquisition can be
developed. The Roman decision to keep the British colony despite an initial and continual high
military cost is better understood in light of the increase in grain and metal production immediately
before and during the Roman occupation.

Recent research into maize storage behavior among the Yucatec Maya has enabled the development
of a storage model based on the organizational structure of spatial usage and activity scheduling at
modern houselots. This model provides an interpretive framework for storage identification by reveal-
ing the spatial patterning of material residues. Contemporary household information also indicates
that storage plays an important role in the development of economic differences. These data show
how different organizational aspects of storage behavior in association with other household variables
- “provide a means to monitor differential wealth. Using storage as a surrogate measure of status/wealth
could significantly improve our understanding of social stratification.

[38] PREHISTORIC LAND USE PATTERNS IN THE CENTRAL OREGON CASCADE RANGE
Relationships between site locations and the distribution of major resources within a 1/2 mile
radius of that point offer an explanation for montane settlement patterns. Of particular interest are
nonforested environments, both wet and dry, which support 85% of Cascade’s flora and provide
primary forage for deer and elk. These landtypes are shown to be more frequently associated with
upland site areas than expected. A natural tendency toward self-perpetuation suggests a level of
predictability for aboriginal populations seasonally exploiting plant and animal resources at all ele-

has been used to reconstruct a drought index for North Carolina from AD 372 to 1985 which indicates

[27] TRENDS IN BIOARCHEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN TEXAS:
CHANGES IN THE DATA BASE AND THEORETICAL ORIENTATION

Bioarchaeological research followed the North American trend of shifting interests from distin-
guishing temporal and spatial samples to paleodemography and paleopathology. Additionally, a spatial
shift in skeletal samples was documented; single interments were typically recovered in western
Texas during the first half of the century, while more recent research has concentrated upon recovery
of material from multiple interment sites in eastem Texas. Changes in collecting procedures and
curation have also occurred. Earlier recovered remains were sporadically collected and inconsistently
curated while more recent materials from multiple interment sites have been more systematically
collected and curated. These shifts in the data base have altered the nature of the questions which
can be addressed by bioarchaeologists as much as the questions asked have affected the nature of the
samples recovered.

[10] ORGANIC MATTER: A CLUE FOR INTERPRETING LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION

The organic matter of both buried archaeological deposits and existing soils is one element often
studied to interpret landscape evolution. The depositonal history and post-depositional cycling of
organic matter, in both ancient and modem sites, can be interpreted by determining the source of the
organic material, how it was transported to the site and, most importantly, how it has been altered
since deposition. Soils that have developed in archaeological parent material contain organic matter
that has accumulated in a fashion that is similar to soils from uninhabited sites. The principal
difference between organic matter from cultural and noncultural settings lies in the amount of organic
matter, its location in the solum and the amount of time that chemicals and weathering products
have been interacting with the organic matter.

in the investigation of the deposit’s formational history. Although documentation of assemblage and
spatial attributes of bone weathering and deterioration, skeletal disarticulation, preferred orientation
and post-occupational modifications can be used to study the unique formational history of a bonebed,
results of such specific analyses must be incorporated into a more general interpretive framework.

assemblage provide compelling evidence of distinctive Spanish dietary patterns; yet, shallow deposits

depleted much of the shrub wood of the river terraces and the Spanish were depending on coniferous

contain low and high MU elements from adult individuals. Low altitude agricultural settlements
have high MU adult skeletal elements. These intersettlement differences are explained by condition-

[43] THE ICONOGRAPHY OF CONTACT: SPANISH INFLUENCES IN THE ROCK ART OF THE
MIDDLE RIO GRANDE

Spanish expansion into the Middle Rio Grande was frustrated by difficult terrain and the scarcity
of permanent water. Their influence, however, is recorded in rock art sites that show European
material culture or conform to Plains iconography. The initial colonizing missions and later retaliatory
expeditions provide terse accounts that serve as a context for the rock art. The advent of the Plains
Indians is chronicled, the expansion and retraction of the Spanish frontier traced and environmental
conditions inferred.

[4] THE ORGANIZATION OF CERAMIC PRODUCTION DURING THE LATE PREHISTORIC
PERIOD OF NORTH CHINA

Interpretations regarding changing organization of ceramic production during the Longshan (final
pre-state) period of North China are made based upon examination of vessels from archacological
work stations and museums in Henan and Shandong provinces for variability in techniques used in
different steps of production (preparation of paste, shaping, decorating, firing). Methods of analysis
include calculation of diversity of techniques used to produce individual functional classes of vessels
(defined primarily by morphological attributes). The proposition in the Chinese and western archae-
ological literature that specialist production was prevalent is evaluated and changes in the organization
of production are discussed.

[1] SOUTHWESTERN REGIONAL SYSTEMS: DEMOGRAPHY, ECONOMY, AND
SOCIOPOLITICS PRECEDING CONTACT

During the two centuries preceding European contact, populations occupying the central and
northern Southwest developed sociopolitical and economic systems at regional scales. These systems
appear largely autonomous when certain kinds of material distributions, like ceramics, are considered.
Yet population relocation and reorganization following contact suggest that interregional connectivity
and integration existed prior to contact, that a more inclusive level of interregional organization was
present. In this paper I define and describe these systems and posit an organizational model that
partially accounts for the demographic reorganization that occurred among native southwestern
groups following the Spanish entrada.

[37] COLOTZINGO: NEW LIGHT ON THE PUEBLA PRECLASSIC

The role of the Puebla region during the Mesoamerican Preclassic is poorly understood due in large
part to a lack of archaeological documentation. Recent research by the University of the Americas
and the Centro Regional de Puebla (INAH) in the Atlixco Valley of western Puebla indicates that this
area of the Central Highlands played an important part during this time period since the archaeological
materials recovered show relationships not only with the Olmec tradition, which had spread to
cadishatine sites (e.g, Chalcatzingo and Las Bocas}, but also with cultural developments in West
Mexico.

This study focus on a group of sites in northeast Miyagi Prefecture around the Kitakami River. These
sites all have components of the early Obora pottery type of the first half of the Final Jomon. By
examination of the sites’ geographic positions relative to natural features and to other contempora-

ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALOGY IN MAYA ARCHAEOLOGY

The use of ethnographic analogy as a means of reconstructing a prehistoric society should not be
setected. However, strict guidelines need to be laid out to make this effort worthwhile. This paper
wall atrempt to define some of the limitations in the application of such analogy. 1) The value of all
date with potential explanatory power must be assessed. Certain factors (e.g., ecology, intercultural
cestects! may make the use of ethnographic analogies superfluous. 2) Whenever such analogies are
deemed appropriate, the link between continuity in form and continuity in meaning is an absolutely
necessary one to validate any explanation made. Data will be drawn from the literature and from
aechecological fieldwork in Belize to illustrate these points.

[41] FROM CERAMIC TECHNIQUE TO SOCIAL BEHAVIOR
Experimental pottery making acquaints the archaeologist with the series of choices made by the

Experimental replications of the Thessalian Greek Neolithic “scraped” style produced visually similar
results with several different techniques, at least two of which are represented on sherds from the
same deposit at Plateia Magoula Zarko. The larger question raised is why the prehistoric potters,
working at the same time in the same social context, used different techniques to achieve visually
similar results,

[68] KLUCKHOHN REAPPRAISED: THE CHACOAN SYSTEM AS AN EGALITARIAN
ENTERPRISE
Recent models have explained Chacoan culture growth in terms of ranked, hierarchically organized
sociopolitical systems that emerged in response to redistributive needs in the San Juan Basin. It is
argued that observed Chacoan settlement and architectural variability reflects organizational differ-
ences of two social groups that shared many cultural attributes but which were not organized as a
single coherent functioning entity. It is further proposed that organizational differences of the two
groups do not reflect egalitarian versus ranked social systems but two contrasting egalitarian modes,
one utilizing a process of rotating sequential hierarchies to accommodate a larger population base.

The central Ohio River Valley marks the southwesternmost zone of pure northern flint corn during

The mechanics and implications of the adoption of northem flint corn are examined using botanical

[61] TAXONOMY OF NORTH AMERICAN LATE PLEISTOCENE BISON AND THE MILL IRON
SITE LOCAL FAUNA
Multivariate analyses of bison biometrics suggest evolutionary changes seen in bison horn cores,
used for many years as the primary taxonomic criterion for the genus, may simply reflect an allometric
relationship with evolutionary changes in body size. Principal component regressions between body
. size and horn core mean measures indicate populations of late Pleistocene and Holocene North
American bison “species” conform to the same allometric model suggesting a high degree of relat-
edness between the "species." As bison body size diminished during late Pleistocene and Holocene
because of life history adaptations to environmental changes, horn core size and shape responded.
Multivariate analyses of bison skull morphology suggest recognizing the following species: Bison
priscus, B. latifrons, B. antiquus and B. bison. Environmental changes contributing to these mor-
phological differences can be substantiated in part by other vertebrate members of the Mill Iron local
fauna.

clays can be manipulated to burn buff. The parameters of this reaction are presented and discussed.
Temporal and spatial! variation in the conditions favoring the "buff’’ reaction are also reviewed.

[22] READING THE PAST: FROM RECONSTRUCTION TO DECONSTRUCTION IN
ARCHAEOLOGY
Working from the philosophy of Jacques Derrida and its applications in literary criticism, the nature
and interrelationship of context and ideology in archaeological interpretation is explored. In place of
existing paradigms, deconstruction—the analysis of the process and conditions of the production of
meaning—is proposed as both an interpretive and a critical concept. In particular, deconstruction
addresses the problem of masking ideologies which an archaeology conceived on reconstruction had
created, Both approaches recognize the archaeological “text as a construct; the difference, it is argued,
lies in the manner in which that construct is treated in interpretation.

[39] LITHICS AND MOBILITY: THE HOMOL OVI CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGE
Upham has proposed that many pueblo period lithic scatters in the American Southwest were not
limited activity sites of farmers, as commonly assumed, but instead were created by hunter-gatherers
occupying the “interstices” between the pueblos. To evaluate Upham's arguments, recent studies
addressing the impact of mobility on lithic technology are reviewed and general characteristics of a
mobile technology are outlined. Based on these characteristics, spatio-temporal variation in chipped
stone materials collected near Winslow, Arizona is examined and the likelihood of hunter-gatherer
populations living contemporaneously with the Homolovi pueblos is assessed.

[22] HISTORY, AGENCY, STRUCTURE AND PRODUCTION
Based on comparative analysis of several early state societies, societies are viewed as systems
consisting of hierarchically organized subsystems with their own internal logic of development.
Particular systems of production establish an internal systemic dynamic, replete with built-in struc-
tural oppositions. However, even societies sharing similar structural oppositions and systemic dynam-
ics do not necessarily experience similar social transformations. The actual relationship of social
classes, their momentary relative power, in context of particular social structures, influences forms
of social struggle and oppositional resolution—humans creating their own history. The resolution of
class oppositions cannot be determined a priori. This puts into question the assumption that general
laws of development (ahistorical laws) can be devised.

: [62] SITE TYPES AND SAMPLE REQUIREMENTS FOR VEGETATIONAL RECONSTRUCTION
BASED ON CHARCOAL
Charcoal is the primary data for lifeway and vegetational reconstructions based on plant macrofos-
sils. Two production/deposition models, random and nonrandom, compete as the proper basis for its
interpretation. Conclusions based on specimen counts depend on extremely large samples or on
collections which can reasonably be assumed to have been produced and deposited randomly. The
multicomponent Bachman site (47SB202) provides an ideal setting for random-based charcoal analysis
because of the nature of its occupations: short-term camps. Extensive sampling of well preserved
contexts highlights both Wisconsin lowland forest dynamics and cultural wood use preferences over
the last 2500 years.

[51] PROGRAMMING THE WEAVING PROCESS TO GENERATE ANASAZI DECORATIONS
At least four different types of ceramic decorations having unusual geometric properties appear on
a variety of Anasazi wares from Pueblo III times. The decorations can be generated by painting design
detail on weaving elements, assembling the painted elements to form weaves and then separating
structures observable within the resultant decorative array. Symmetry rules for placing design detail
on weaving elements serve as programming instructions, analogous to the contemporary generation
of computer graphics. Geometric skill exceeding that ordinarily employed in producing decorations
in the prehistoric Southwest and Mesoamerica is evident. A discussion is presented on utilizing these
patterns for temporal and geographical studies.

}4] SEXUAL SEGREGATION OF ACTIVITY AREAS: THREE ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL
EXAMPLES
Analysts of prehistoric intrasite spatial organization have often assumed that sexually segregated
groups perform refuse producing activities at discrete locations. This paper tests that assumption by
comparing behavioral data from the Ache, Alyawara and Hadza. There is considerable variation among
che three groups, with the Alyawara being the most highly and the Ache the least segregated. Although
sexually distinct activity areas may occur in some cases, archaeologists have an imperfect understand-
me of factors determining variability between cases. The roles of predator pressure and food sharing
«= conditioning this aspect of site structure are considered.

13] THE EVOLUTION OF DEMOGRAPHIC ASPECTS OF SETTLEMENT PATTERN USING GIS
SYSTEMS
This paper uses GIS systems to predict the changing structure and form of settlement patterns
chrough time. Alternative demographic regimes based upon stable and unstable models, as well as
eoe. two and three sector transition models, are combined with ARC/INFO’s network system to
create the predictive machinery. The predictions from these alternative models are then verified by |
comparison with the size and location of actual settlements through an extended period of time. The
4ets base consists of several thousand prehistoric and historic sites in western New York.

{65} SLICES OF TIME: UNIT CONSTRUCTION AND SUBSISTENCE CHANGE IN THE
AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
How do we construct the theoretical frameworks that allow us to monitor change in subsistence
peactices in the prehistoric Southwest? What are the components of agricultural systems and how are
they represented archaeologically? The construction of theoretical and empirical units necessary to )
the study of change is addressed in the context of the assumption that subsistence systems in the
Amencan Southwest have changed in response to selective pressures, and that identifying those
pressures provides a means of constructing explanations of culture change. Implications for unit
construction derived from an examination of traditional agricultural practices near Zuni, New Mexico,
will also be considered.

[58] LITHIC SCATTERS, ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDSCAPES AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR
Structuring of archaeological evidence in terms of discrete spatio-temporal units—sites—is con-
cepeually unsatisfactory, often inapplicable and seldom justified. As a result, large portions of archae-
ological data are either misunderstood or not fully utilized. Lithic scatters can be used as a point of
departure for a more comprehensive approach, designed to recover archaeological landscapes rather
them individual sites. The present contribution deals with three levels of landscape oriented research:
(1) formation of lithic scatters and their controlled recovery, (2) reconstruction of archaeological
landscapes and (3) identification of past patterns of land-use and other behavioural variables. Surface
collected and excavated data from southern Ireland are used as an example in this study.

AN ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS OF MOON HOUSE, CEDAR MESA, SOUTHEASTERN UTAH
Moon House is an exceptionally well preserved 13th century cliff dwelling. An analysis of construc-
son methods, room function and construction sequence for Moon House and two associated cliff
dwellings indicates recurrent reconstruction, remodeling and reorganization of functionally distinct
rooms. The early occurrence of similar household units at each of the three cliff dwellings contrasts
wath the latest room reorganization. The final late A.D. 1260s reconstruction and reorganization
resulted in functional differentiation and interdependence between the three cliff dwellings and a
high ratio (6:1) of useable storage rooms to living rooms, and is the basis for suggestions of seasonal
habitation.

A DYNAMIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATABASE FOR THE MICROCOMPUTER: THE SHOOFLY
VILLAGE EXAMPLE
The nature of archaeological information is such that careful thought must be given to the trans-
lation of data to a computer format. The commercially available software programs dBase Ill +
(Database) and R&R (Relational Report Writer) are used to create and implement an integrated,
dynamic, user-friendly database system for the Payson Archaeological Research Expedition. This
system is designed to be efficient and flexible by utilizing the powerful relational capabilities of both
dBase III + and R&R. Data files are linked by specimen number to provenience files, thereby elimi-
' nating repetitive compilation of locational information. The system’s capabilities are demonstrated
through examples of data management and simple data manipulation.

(USGS) EXAMINATION OF PROJECTILE POINTS UTILIZING DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING
FOR TOPOGRAPHIC ENHANCEMENTS
Problems in projectile point typology are often the result of qualitative and/or subjective descrip-
tions of projectile point characteristics. When a photograph of the projectile point is converted into a
digital image, certain characteristics can be analyzed through existing image-processing algorithms.
Enhancement procedures developed for digital terrain analysis, when applied to images of projectile
points, can produce a quantitatively derived sketch, enhance flake scars and indicate degree of
roughness (directly associated with the amount of production input).

THE LITHOLOGY OF THE BIRGER “BAUXITE” FIGURINE
A number of Mississippian Tradition effigy figurines have been identified as made of “fire-clay” or
“bauxite”. X-ray powder diffractometry (XRD) of the Birger figurine reveals its dominant mineralogy
to be boehmite and its total mineral composition matches that of other such effigy carvings. Arkansas
bauxite, typically, is gibbsite-rich and all but one of the numerous varieties of fire-, burley-, diaspore-
and flint-clays from Missouri are diaspore- or kaolinite-rich and devoid of boehmite. One exception,
boehmite-rich “burley-flint clay”, suggests that the provenance of the “boehmite-bauxite” of the
. Birger figurine might be in Missouri.

RASTER BASED PROJECTILE POINT MEASUREMENT
Traditionally, projectile points are measured using mechanical devices, a time consuming process
prone to random and interpretive errors. Capturing point silhouettes with a video camera and digitizing
, software is quick and less prone to error. The data obtained is raster based and allows for direct
comparison of different images by simple computer routines. Relational data, such as change of point
width along the midline, are easily obtained and compared. The display demonstrates the acquisition
and analysis of raster data from a sample of projectile points from southern Nevada. The results are
compared with traditional techniques.
