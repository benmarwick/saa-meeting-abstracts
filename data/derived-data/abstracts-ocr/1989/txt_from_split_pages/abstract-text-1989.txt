, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
[1] COLUMBIAN CONSEQUENCES, PART I; THE ENTRADA INTO THE AMERICAN
SOUTHEAST
Organized in three sessions, this is the second symposium co-sponsored by the Society for American
Archaeology and the Smithsonian Institution Press to anticipate the 1992 Columbian Quincentenary,
This three-year series of symposia explores the strategic diversity evident during the early colonial
period in the Spanish Borderlands. Participants—including archaeologists, historians, Native
Americans, geographers, and art historians—examine the Spanish strategies employed and the diverse
Native American counter-strategies that evolved to cope with European intrusions. Papers will also
evaluate the success and relevance of contemporary archaeological inquiry into European/Native
American interaction in the Spanish Borderlands.
[2] MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC ADAPTATIONS IN EURASIA: REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES
The debate concerning the interpretations of Mousterian assemblage variability is one that has been
taught to an entire generation of American archacologists. New data and methods are now changing
the traditional theories, and the current view sees the Mousterian as being much more complex than
, previously thought. The focus of this symposium is to present major overviews on regional variation
in the Middle Paleolithic, based on the most recent excavations in the Western Old World. Major
themes stress regional typological, technological, and raw material variability, environmental factors,
and inter- and intra-site activity differences. This symposium is organized jointly with Middle
Paleolithic Adaptations in Eurasia: Topical Overviews.
[3] REGIONAL PERSPECTIVES IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN ARCHAEOLOGY
Archaeology in Southeast Asia is so recent that only a few regions have chronological sequences.
Often a sequence is based on a single site. Yet prehistoric research in the area is addressing issues far
beyond chronology. The data emerging and interpretive approaches used promise to contribute to the
general discipline of archaeology, even if our data may be less comprehensive than other parts of the
world. This symposium will present a diverse array of research efforts by archaeologists working in
Southeast Asia who seek to comment on diachronic or synchronic patterns in the region's prehistory.
| [4] HOUSEHOLD DIFFERENTIATION: CASES FROM THE MESOAMERICAN LOWLANDS
Lowland Mesoamerica presents specific environmental conditions which are shared throughout the
| region. A comparison of lowland households from the Pacific piedmont, Gulf coast, northern Yucatan,
Belize and Guatemala provides an opportunity to explore these similarities. Research on the different
cultures of the lowlands relies on a diverse data base in order to reconstruct the ancient economic
systems and this symposium brings together ethnographic, ethnohistorical, and archaeological studies
im an effort to better understand the basic economic unit of lowland Mesoamerican societies.
{5] THE WOODLAND PERIOD IN THE OHIO VALLEY: A COMPARISON OF CULTURAL
DEVELOPMENT IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY DRAINAGES
The Woodland Period in eastern North Ameri& is dominated by development of tribal societies and
the Ohio Valley contains some of the best evidence for this evolving complexity. This symposium
compares general patterns of adaptation in the Mid-Ohio Valley and its main tributaries. The Ohio
River presents different resource sets, ecological risks, and interactional costs from those of its main
eributaries, and their relative effects on cultural development are examined. Differences in settlement
patterns, site structure, and material culture are highlighted and hypotheses concerning intraregional
relationships within this riverine universe are constructed.
j6] THE EVOLUTION OF DOMESTIC ARCHITECTURE IN THE SOUTH eeu ANDES
Recent research in the south-central Andes has provided an unprecedented opportunity to chart the
evolution of domestic architecture in the region from the Archaic Period through Inka times, This
symposium looks at the transformation of domestic architectpre in three areas—the Osmore drainage,
2 major western valley, and the northern and southern portions of the Titicaca basin, and focuses upon
ways in which models and explanations of changes in architecture and the organization of domestic
space can be used to explore processes of ethnic and social differentiation, household organization, and
the structure of activity performance and site utilization,
] EXCAVATING SHELL-BEARING SITES
In spite of over 100 years of investigation in shell-bearing sites we are only slightly closer to decoding
the cultural and natural formation processes and human behavior encoded in them. Assumptions about
shells and few methodological innovations for excavators of shell-bearing sites are responsible for this

situation. Middle range theory about maritime adaptation has in large part ignored these methodologi-
cal issues. This set of papers make it abundantly clear what retarding assumptions are and that strides
in knowledge are linked to innovations in techniques. The presentations will benefit anyone who will
work in a shell-bearing site.

[9] EUROPE IN THE FOURTH MILLENNIUM

Food production spread throughout Europe over the course of at least a millennium. During this time
foraging and farming were combined in a variety of ways as food production was adapted to specific
social and environmental conditions. By the end of the fourth millennium, Europe was an intricate
mosaic: relatively complex societies had emerged in some regions, while incipient farming systems
were only beginning to appear in others. Papers in this symposium examine social and economic
developments in the Balkans, Aegean, Iberia, Russian Plain, northern France, North European Plain,
Denmark/Scandinavia, Alpine Foreland, and Ireland during the fourth millennium B.C,
[10] SOUTH ASIAN ARCHAEOLOGY: RECENT RESEARCH AND NEW THEORETICAL

PERSPECTIVES

Archacological research in South Asia conducted over the past decade has considerably increased our
knowledge of pre- and proto-historic and historic developments in this area of the world. In this
symposium, results of recent work will be presented, along with theoretical models dealing with state
formation, historic empires, and prehistoric social networks. Particular topics to be discussed include:
prehistoric lithic procurement systems, the formation and structure of the Indus Valley Civilization,
and the political, economic and symbolic organization of historic empires.

[11] CHANGING VIEWS OF CLASSIC MAYA POLITICAL ORGANIZATION

Classic Maya politics have long been of interest to archaeologists, who have sought for over fifty
years to explain the composition and organization of Lowland polities. Yet the subject is stil] not well
understood. Some scholars speak of “large-scale centralized polities,” while others see only “decentral-
ized city-states” or “feudal kingdoms.” It is hard to imagine a more divergent set of opinions, and few
seem to agree on which view is correct, or whether a particular model can be generalized to all areas
of the Lowlands. This symposium presents new archaeological, epigraphic, and iconographic evidence
of Classic political organization. Its goal is to represent diversity of opinion, yet at the same time to
move towards consensus on a fundamental problem in American archaeology.

[15] ZOOARCHAEOLOGY IN THE POST-PROCESSUAL AGE: IS THERE A PLACE?

The great boom in the development of Zooarchaeology in the last 20 years has been stimulated by
the demands on method made by the research paradigm often labeled eather “new” or “processual”
archaeology. An explicit view of culture as an adaptive system required monitoring biological variables
in the records of ancient behavioral systems. Now the ecological and explicitly scientafic emphasis of
thjs familar archaeology is being challanged by 2 potpourri af mew post-processus! aperoaches which
emphasize historical, symbolic, ideational, and politica) factors. This symposium addresses the part
zooarchaeologists can play in these new developments.

[16] THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF GARDEN AND FIELD

Fields and gardens are increasingly becoming the subject of erchaeslowical vestigation by prac-
titioners in several disciplines and theoretical schools. Landscape archecologers use ewidlence at a
variety of scales, from the regional to the microscopic, to Searn how people ceed che Land for pleasure
and provender. The papers presented here focus om the identifications and analysis of gardens and fields
as loci of these activities. This symposium aims to grve scheoliers werkting = Geren: archacological

| [18] WOMEN AND PRODUCTION IN PREHISTORY
This symposium explores the porential of using an explicitly feminist social theory in archaeological
research and interpretation by applying gender categories to familiar and original sets of archaeological
| data, This approach goes beyond finding men and women in the archaeological record; it sees gender
| as an issue of history and as rooted in the dynamics of material and human resources. Each paper shows
| how attention to gender dynamics can illuminate a broad spectrum of issues concerning production in
| prehistory. The application of this perspective is seen to radically reframe both archaeological theory
! and evidence.
|
| [19] RETHINKING THE TERMINAL ARCHAIC-WOODLAND PERIOD TRANSITION IN THE
lr NORTHEAST
| This symposium addresses a period of prehistory that witnessed increased complexity among
| hunter-gatherer populations in northeastern North America. The Terminal Archaic and early portions
| of the Woodland period have been long characterized as a transitional era from nomadic hunter-gatherer
adaptations to a more sedentary incipient cultivator pattern across much of the region. Environmental
fluctuations and apparent changes in human population densities have been correlated with notable
mortuary ceremonialism and long distance exchange networks ca. 1,500 B.C. to A.D, 300. Individual
contributions employ reanalyzed and recent data from the region to refine one or another aspects of
prevailing models about this period of putative transition.
'
| [20] ADVICE AND DISSENT; AN EXCHANGE OF VIEWS ABOUT ARCHAEOLOGICAL ISSUES
| CONFRONTING THE 1990'S
| This symposium will involve extemporaneous discussion by the participants of issues of relevance
| to the discipline of archaeology, with special emphasis on assessment, redefinition or reaffirmation of
| intellectual orientation, direction, and methodology. Part I of the program will focus on the nature,
scope and goals of archaeological investigation, Part II will be concerned with an evaluation of the
conceptual tools and learning strategies with which archaeological goals are approached, as well as a
discussion of the direction that the discipline may or should take in the future. Questions or comments
from the audience will be encouraged.
[22] COLUMBIAN CONSEQUENCES, PART I: THE IMPACT OF HISPANIC COLONIZATION
IN THE SOUTHEAST AND CARIBBEAN
See Symposium |1].
[23] SAA SPECIAL SESSION: OUR VANISHING PAST—THE WILLFUL DESTRUCTION OF A
NATION'S HERITAGE
The Society for American Archaeology has undertaken a major project to examine the looting and
vandalism of archaeological sites in this country and the consequent destruction of irreplaceable
archaeological information. This symposium is an gptegral component of that project, and will be
followed in May by a major working conference. Hel, specialists in various aspects of the problem
will provide information on the magnitude and dimensions of looting, its impact on the country’s
heritage, current legal and technical methods of protecting our data base, the role of public education
in combating the problem, and what the SAA stance can and should do about the issue.
| [24] MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC ADAPTATIONS IN EURASIA: TOPICAL OVERVIEWS
The Middle Paleolithic is currently enjoying increased attention as new data and theories point to
this period as being pivotal in the evolution of modern Homo sapiens and modern ee behavior.
This symposium explores some of the new kinds of questions that are being asked concerning
Mousterian assemblages and their reflections of Neanderthal behavior, including the interpretation of
typological variability, the nature of the subsistence base, curation, and the question of style and
symbolism. This symposium is organized jointly with Middle Paleolithic Adaptations in Eurasia:
Regional Perspectives.
[26] MAYA SUBSISTENCE: ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOBIOLOGICAL APPROACHES
, Problem-oriented research and the use of specialized recovery techniques such as flotation in recent
years by Maya archaeologists has led to the recovery of a diversity of prehistoric plant food and animal
remains. Ethnobiology—which includes the study of modern, indigenous peoples’ use of plants and
animals—can provide a useful interpretative framework for ancient food remains. In this symposium,
various archaeological and ethnological studies of Maya diet are presented, These studies provide new
perspectives on ancient Maya agriculture, the ancient landscape, and use of wild plants and animals.
, 46 |27] National Forests in the South
| [27] NATIONAL FORESTS IN THE SOUTH: CULTURAL RESOURCES AND MANAGEMENT
This session will highlight the cultural resources, research and management activities within the
| National Forests of the Southern Region of the U.S. Forest Service. An overview of the evolution of the

Cultural Resource program from its beginning in 1973 to its current status will be given. Other
management concerns of Forest Service cultural resources specialists will also be discussed, Other
papers will discuss research into lifestyles of Archaic and Late Prehistoric peoples in eastern Kentucky,
Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Arkansas. A discussant from the Arkansas Archaeological
Survey will also provide an additional viewpoint of these papers.
[29] CERAMIC PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION: AN INTEGRATED APPROACH

Production and distribution are interrelated components of all economic systems. Nevertheless,
studies of pottery economics have typically considered one or the other in isolation, This symposium
treats production and distribution as interacting subsystems of the broader ceramic economy. The
contributed papers present archacological and ethnoarchacological data from a variety of Old and New
World ceramic economic systems and examines the ways that production and distribution processes
influence one another. We suggest that studying ceramic production and distribution as integrated
subsystems is a valuable approach for understanding prehistoric pottery economics.
[30] ARCHAEOFAUNAS AND SEASONALITY

This symposium focuses on techniques for examining incremental growth structures and methods
of interpreting them. Papers in the symposium address this technological and methodological theme,
using substantive data for illustrative purposes only. The rationale for offering this symposium lies in
the perceived need to clarify which examination techniques and interpretive methods are applicable
to which types of data, and to see if techniques, methods and terminology can be standardized. These
issues need to be resolved before a) reliable seasonality interpretations of substantive data can be made,
and b) seasonality analyses and their interpretations can be widely and clearly understood. .
[31] KALINGA ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY

The Kalinga Ethnoarchaeology Project was initiated in 1973 and another year of fieldwork has just
been completed among these tribal peoples of the mountains of northern Luzon, the Philippines. This
project provides an unprecedented longitudinal view of a pottery making and using society. During the
past year, information on pottery trade, “use-wear", use-life, as well as economic and agricultural data,
were collected. For the first time, a project focused upon Kalinga basketry was undertaken. The papers
in this symposium report results of the research and explore the implications for archaeological
interpretation. ;
[33] COPING WITH SITE LOOTING: SOUTHERN PERSPECTIVES

Digging up artifacts and human skeletal rernains for profit, fun, or both, is epidemic. The record of
human prehistory on our continent is being dug up and kept, traded or sold at an unprecedented rate.
Thehistorical record is not immune to plunder, cither: Revolutionary and Civil War sites are a lucrative
target. We spend millions of dollars “protecting” our cultural heritage; the collector makes millions
selling it. This symposium addresses ways that the professional archaeological community and the
American public are coming to terms with one another to protect, preserve, and use heritage resources
in the south.
[35] THE EVOLUTION OF COMPLEX SOCIETY IN EARLY AND MIDDLE FORMATIVE

MESOAMERICA:;: NEW EVIDENCE AND INTERPRETATIONS

During the past two years there have been over a dozen new archaeological projects exploring Early
and Middle Formative cultures in eastern Mesoamerica (ca. 2,000 to 1,000 B.C. }. These researchers have
demonstrated that this period was one of rapid cultural evolution and surprising social complexity.
New evidence on these early cultures shows the presence of ranking, public architecture, long distance
trade, economic specialization, and interregional ideological systems. This symposium will present
this most recent evidence from excavations in Veracruz, Chiapas, Guatemala, and El Salvador. We will
also interpret and discuss implications of these new findings for the theoretical debate on the evolution
of early Mesoamerican civilization.
[36] HOUSEHOLDS AND SETTLEMENTS IN THE MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD

While the excavation and analysis of households and communities has for years been an important
part of research on the Mississippian Period, a growing awareness of the explanatory potential of the
domestic context is expanding our understanding of the variability in social and material adaptive
strategies. The contributors to this symposium examine the basic economic and social units of
Mississippian society, from diverse areas of the Eastern United States, by exploring the functional
, | [49] Archaeobotany Through Phytolith Analysis 47
| differences in domestic material assemblages, the relationship of farmsteads to larger-order com-
munities, and organizational complexity within communities.
[38] ETHICS IN PROFESSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY
While certain dilemmas have been widely debated of late (e.g., “reburial”), there remain an array of
concerns likely to prove troublesome over the next decade, Focus is on these anticipated problems,
including those created by recent Federal and state statutes and procedures. To meet these new
challenges it is essential that these problems be defined and an appropriate stance proposed. An
emphasis is placed on the need for a consensus ethic among archaeologists to create a united and
effective professional body.
[39] ARCHAEOMETRY IN ACTION
The surge of scientific innovations of recent decades has greatly influenced the discipline of
archaeology. Science-based archaeological research (often called Archaeometry) has grown steadily,
using analytical techniques for cultural interpretations. Now few archaeological studies are developed
without the support of paleoevironmental data, calibrated radiocarbon dates, and artifactual structural
analyses. Archaeometry in Action will present eleven analytical procedures that are currently being
employed in archaeology to help resolve and explain archaeological problems and processes.
[41] HUNTER GATHERER MOBILITY, RESOURCE TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE
Bringing consumers and resources together in time and space is a foremost problem to be solved by
hunter-gatherers, and of considerable interest to archaeologists. Hunter-gatherer groups may move to
the resource location, may collect the resource and transport it to another location, may collect and
store the resource, or use these and similar strategies in combination. This symposium considers the
various factors which may affect the efficiency of alternative strategies. Hypotheses generated from
evolutionary theory are tested in case studies of plant, animal, and lithic material exploitation.
[44] COLUMBIAN CONSEQUENCES, PART III: THE MISSIONS OF LA FLORIDA
See Symposium |1].
[45] CORRIDOR STUDIES IN CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY
Contract archaeological surveys of highways, powerlines, and communications corridors have
resulted in an immense “grey literature” of thousands of miles of reconnaissance surveys, hundreds of
testing excavations, and many data recovery projects around the country, This symposium offers an
opportunity to explore the potentials and limitations of corridor studies to beome a substantial data
base for regional prehistory. This potential data base is promising, yet there could be more consensus
as to how corridor studies are implemented, interpreted, and assessed,
[46] VILLAGE COMMUNITIES IN EARLY COMPLEX SOCIETIES
Moving beyond the traditional research focus on large centers in urban and state systems, this
symposium examines and synthesizes recent investigayions of small communities in early complex
, societies of Mesoamerica and the Near East. Particinatts discuss the range of social and economic
activities performed by small communities, the nature and degree of village integration into regional
networks, the utility and meaning of the concepts “urban” and “rural,” and the larger implications of
small site studies for the analysis of early complex societies. |
[47] APPLICATIONS OF MAMMALIAN MORTALITY DATA FOR THE STUDY OF |
PREHISTORIC HUMAN PREDATOR ECOLOGY
The theme of the symposium is the use of mortality data in archaeological research on
human/hominid predator ecology. Secure applications of mortality models depend on a comprehensive
understanding of the causes of variation in the age structures of death assemblages. Issues include
seasonal and long-term demographic cycles that affect living prey or carcass availability along with
relationships between predator strategies and prey mortality patterris. The papers represent a diverse
set of approaches, including mortality profile analysis, seasonality analysis, inter-specific predator
comparisons, as well as actualistic studies of death patterns in contemporary mammalian populations.
[49] ARCHAEOBOTANY THROUGH PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS
Phytolith analysis has proven to be an enormously flexible and productive tool for investigating
archaeobotanical and paleoecological questions. The papers presented in this symposium represent a
wide range of archaeological applications, from analysis of diet to identification of specific crops to
reconstruction of animal husbandry practices. Recently developed extraction techniques have ex-
panded and improved the data recoverable from coprolites and tooth cementum, as well as from
non-opal phytoliths. Ongoing research into the complex issues of phytolith identification and
, a
48 [50] Paleoshorelines and Prehistoric Settlement
taphonomy are also reported. The symposium comprises 4 State-of-the-art presentation of this sig-
nificant but relatively under-utilized archaeobotanical methodology. |
[50] PALEOSHORELINES AND PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT |

The evaluation of coastal archaeological sites is 2 complicated process involying callaboration ;
between archaeologists and various natural scientists. It is of particular importance to understand how
the location of the site differs from that which it occupied at the tume it w2s inhabited. In all areas,
change in sea level must be factored in: in many areas isostatic rebound must be added to the equation, .
and in the most complicated, co-seismic uplift, subsidence and tilt must also be evaluated and taken
into account. The papers in this symposium examine both methods of arriving at satisfactory
reconstructions and results in various areas. J
[51] CULTURE CHANGE AND VARIABILITY IN THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC
The unprecedented pace of human cultural evolution which began with the Upper Paleolithic at
around 35,000 years ago has been the subject of discussion for several decades. Recent approaches to
the material store of the Upper Paleolithic have shed new light on the nature of Upper Paleolithic
innovation and continuity. This symposium will address both the change through time and the
contemporary variability visible in faunal exploitation and land use strategies, art and body ornamen-
tation, and lithic and bone antler technologies during the Upper Paleolithic throughout the Old World.
[57] THE FRYXELL SYMPOSIUM: HUMANS, DIETS, AND CULTURES—INTERDISCIPLINARY
APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF PREHISTORIC PEOPLES
The Fryxell interdisciplinary session addresses from several perspectives the composition and
adequacy of past diets, interrelationships between nutrition and infectious diseases, linkages between ;
paleopathology and paleodemography, and the archacological study of the adaptive stance of prehistoric
populations from several parts of the Americas. New techniques and research strategies have clarified
4 number of critical human-environmental relationships and identified additional areas for future
investigation. Collectively, the papers underscore the importance of truly integrative approaches to the
study of past peoples and cultures as well as the close relationship between archaeology and biologically
oriented sciences.
[58] WOMEN IN ARCHAEOLOGY: THE SECOND ANNUAL SYMPOSIUM ON THE HISTORY
OF AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY
Women have played a major role in the development of American archaeology, especially in the
Southwest and Mesoamerica. Their contributions have been numerous, varied, and important, ¢.g.,
Florence Hawley Ellis’s research correlating dendrochronology, masonry styles, and ceramics; Anna
Shepard's technical studies of ceramics; and Tatiana Proskouriakoff’s work on Mayan architecture and
glyphs.Nevertheless, histories of American archaeology have paid insufficient attention to these
contributions and those of other women scholars. This symposium examines the work of a number of
. these women, how women are recruited to archaeology, and work within the discipline.
[59] ENVIRONMENT, ECONOMY AND SOCIETY IN THE KHABUR DRAINAGE, SYRIA
In the third and second millennium B.C, the Khabur drainage of northeast Syria saw the emergence
of a number of large walled cities that are identified in historic rexts. The antecedents to these
developments are the focus of this symposium which draws upon excavations and surveys of sites
dating from the sixth to fourth millennium B.C, and considers (1) problems of environmental change;
(2) varied human economic adaptions to the riverine and steppic habitats as seen in floral and faunal
remains and settlement patterns; and (3) social and political interactions as manifest in trade goods,
intrusive ceramic complexes, size distributions of sites, and changes in populations.
[62] HISTORY AND PREHISTORY IN CENTRAL AMERICA: RECENT RESEARCH
This symposium brings together recent archaeological and ethnographic research in Guatemala, E]
Salvador, Honduras, and Costa Rica. Collectively, the papers cover a broad time span from the Maya
Classic (A.D, 250-900) through the Colonial period (1525-1821). Several common themes are addressed
through diverse methodological approaches: the reliability of evidence, interaction, the reconstruction
of economic systems, social status, political organization, and contacts with greater Mesoamerica and
Lower Central America. The unification of papers on prehistory and history reveals many areas of
mutual interest to archaeologists and historians.
{63] CRM IN THE 1990'S
This symposium is intended for discussion of the method and theory of cultural resource manage-
ment and of public policies that affect cultural resource conservation. Cultural Resource Management
will be viewed from the perspectives of managers of programs that have significant impact upon the
, [75] Current Research in Lower Central America 49
nation, region, or state. Topics considered will include: direction of agencies at the start of anew federal
administration; meeting conservation goals; developments in rules, regulations, and guidelines, fund-
ing levels; employment trends; professional certification requirements; recommendations for CRM
professionals, academic archaeologists, and students; and predictions for CRM in the Year 2000.
[64] EARLY PALEOINDIAN ECONOMIES 9F EASTERN NORTH AMERICAN PREHISTORY
This symposium treats “economy” as the mechanisms (production, consumption, distribution,
exchange) of human adaptation. Over the past 60 years, two dominant and competing models of early
Paleoindian (11,500-10,500 B,P.) economy in eastern North America have emerged—specialized hunt-
ing and generalized foraging. Both models are predicated upon assumptions about the antiquity of
humans in the New World, the behavior of modern hunter-gatherers, paleoecological reconstructions,
and the temporal placement of large herbivore extinctions. This symposium evaluates these assump-
tions by identifying patterns in lithic exploitation and human settlement.
[65] ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS
In the last five years a scientific consensus has arisen that global warming due to atmospheric
pollution is inevitable. The United Nations, the U.S. Department of Energy and Environmental
Protection Agency, to name a few, have sponsored large workshops on the problem which were well
attended by many disciplines. Archaeologists have been notably absent. Why is this obvious repository
of information on human responses to global climate change being ignored? This symposium addresses
recent developments in archaeology which might make the data of archaeology more accessible to the
global climate community.
[66] NEW DIRECTIONS IN EUROPEAN PREHISTORY
European prehistory has maintained a long held reputation as the bulwark of typological classifica-
tion. Work conducted by Francois Bordes and his predecessors established this sturdy foundation some
years ago, but theoretically-oriented research aimed at understanding cultural processes has been slow
to follow. The purpose of this symposium is to demonstrate that current research, particularly that
conducted by American-trained archaeologists, is expanding into some extremely innovative areas.
New technology and information derived from other disciplines, as well as state-of-the-art archaeologi-
cal theory, are contributing to this rapid advancement in European prehistory.
[72] ECOLOGICAL RELATIONS AND SOCIAL FORMATIONS IN ARABIAN PREHISTORY
Recent research in Arabia addresses three clusters of interests; 1) Arabia as the hearth of distinctive
social, economic and ecological adaptations to desertic conditions; 2) as a circulator of materials, people
and ideas between East Africa, South Asia, and the Near East; and 3) as a periphery to the agrarian
centers of civilization. These interrelated themes reflect more general questions of human adaptation
to desertic environments and of the dynamic relationship of such marginal areas to agrarian centers.
The papers of this symposium present various aspects of these common problems in light of recent
Arabian research,
[73] SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE IN SOUTHWESTERN ECUADOR
In recent years there has been much new work on various aspects of Prehispanic southwest Ecuador,
Settlement surveys have been carried out and important new sites have been found, especially within
the most recent phases of the Tahuin Project in lowland El Oro province. Ceramic phases and
chronologies are being refined; resource use, water cicartaiea and paleoenvironmental! chanye are
being clarified. This symposium presents new insights in all of these respects. It brings together young
professionals and seasoned scholars, a group within which there is already a good deal of interchange.
[74] EXCHANGE, INTERACTION AND SOCIAL COMPLEXITIY IN OCEANIA 4
In the past decade archaeologists working in Oceania have made considerable advances in the
indentification of prehistoric exchange, often involving the transport of a variety of commodities over
sizeable ocean distances. At the same time the role of exchangeé‘in the evolution of social complexity
has received considerable attention, especially among the stratified societies with craft specialists. This
symposium brings together researchers working throughout Oceania in both modern and ancient
contexts to examine commodity exchange, group interaction, and societal evolution.
[75] CURRENT RESEARCH IN LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA
Current research in the Lower Central American region is advancing on two innovative fronts: 1)
the application of instrumental analysis to archaeological data (remote sensing, neutron activation,
X-ray, S.E.M. technologies) and 2) the combined application of archaeology, art history and technology.
Research in these areas is directed towards a better understanding of the social implications of aesthetic
development and iconographica] systems. Papers will focus on ceramics, stone, metallurgy, jade and
, 50 [77] Recent Developments in the Archaeology
mortuary practices and will evaluate the stylistic evidence for indigenous development and external
influences (Central Mexico, Maya, Olmec} in this intermediate region.
[77] RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ANDROSCOGGIN RIVER
DRAINAGE OF MAINE AND NEW HAMSHIRE
Archaeological data recovered from recent investigations in the Androscoggin River drainage of
Maine and New Hampshire allow us to refine our models of aboriginal occupation and utilization from
the interior montainuous uplands to the coastal lowlands. The papers included in this symposium will
present new information for the entire aboriginal cultural sequence from the Paleoindian through Late
Ceramic and Contact periods as well as address questions of local and regional importance such as
settlement patterning, subsistence strategies, and intra- and interregional trade and exchange.
[78] ARCHAEOASTRONOMY IN THE AMERICAS; TESTING THE HYPOTHESES
The general hypothesis that PreColumbian Native Americans in North, Middle and South America
watched the sky carefully and incorporated this astronomical knowledge in structures and other aspects
of their material culture has received increasing attention over the past two decades. Contributors to
this symposium will discuss recent archaeoastronomical findings in the Americas and explore how
data on astronomical alignments may shed additional light on the adaptive strategies, ritual practices,
and calendric knowledge of the cultures who constructed them.
[80] OBJECTS, CONSUMPTION, AND MEANING
Lively interest is developing in many different disciplines in the social meaning of manufactured
objects. Archaeology can make special contributions to the ongoing discussions because of
archaeologist’s concern for understanding the production and use of an object in its full cultural context,
and because of the unique time depth with which archaeology deals. The papers present case studies
selected from a variety of different contexts to illustrate the kinds of social meanings that people ascribe
to the objects they make, acquire, and consume.

t [5] EARLY WOODLAND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE HOCKING RIVER VALLEY, OHIO
A model] of settlement during the Early Woodland period in southeastern Ohio is considered. First,
the Boudinot site, an open-air hamlet, is described. These and complementary data suggest that hamlet
occupation was seasonal and dynamic yet spatially restricted to local mounds. Then, the Armitage
Mound, one in a large concentration of mounds, is described. These new data suggest that this mound
was the locus of recurrent activities by specific clusters of hamlets, reflecting the growth of territorial-
ly-distinct social corporate groups. This preliminary model is compared with others from the region.

[11] CLASSIC MAYA POLITICAL UNITS AS VIEWED FROM RIO AZUL
Rio Azul data bearing on Classic Maya polities best fits a sequence of Late Preclassic “principalities”

[5] THE HANSEN SITE (15GP14): A MIDDLE/LATE WOODLAND SITE NEAR THE
CONFLUENCE OF THE OHIO AND SCIOTO RIVERS
Excavations performed in 1985 at the Hansen Site in northeastern Kentucky focused on a buried
paleosol containing evidence of Middle to Late Woodland occupation, Features and structures yielded
radiocarbon dates between 300 and 600 A.D. Analysis of the diagnostic cultural material, features and
structures, and non-diagnostic material classes suggested two periods of occupation, both of which
were assigned to the Newtown phase. An overview of the material culture, chronology and internal
site structure of the Hansen Site is presented, and some inferences are drawn regarding changes in
internal and external relationships during the Newtown phase.

[30] PRECISION OF SEASONALITY DETERMINATION IN RINGED SEALS (PHOCA HISPIDA)
Ringed seal (Phoca hispida) remains form an important part of many arctic middens. Examination
of teeth from this species is often used to approximate season of death and therefore time of occupancy
of a site. To measure repeatability of perception of layer type forming at the edge of either dentine or
cementum, seven readings of each tooth from a sample of several hundred were made. The data were
from a modern kill for which the date of death was known. Results suggest that examination of teeth
for seasonality determination can be highly subj&ctive.

[6] ARCHAIC PERIOD DOMESTIC pene paige: sea FROM THE OSMORE BASIN
Excavations at Asana, a deeply stratified open air site dated from approximately 10,000-3,000 B.P. in
the high sierra of the Osmore basin, have provided a unique perspective on changes in domestic
architecture throughout the Archaic Period. This paper describes domestic architecture at four
“instants” of time—8,800-8,600 B.P., 7,000-6,000 B.P., 5,000-4,500 B.P. and 4,009-3,600 B.P.—and
discusses the meaning of changes in the organization and use of space, activity performance, and
community structure observed throughout the Archaic.

[62] ETHNOHISTORIC MODELS FOR NATIVE ECONOMY IN PACIFIC GUATEMALA
Recent ethnohistoric research on the principal ethnic groups of Pacific colonial Guatemala (the
Quiche, Tzutujil, Cakchiquel, Xinca, and Pipil) has produced a wealth of data on native economy. The
Conquest-period Pipil of E! Salvador, for example, had a vibrant system of regional interaction that
moved both staples and luxury goods through a system that linked coastal and interior settlements.
From analysis of the ethnohistoric data, models are constructed that help clarify and explain aspects
of the archaeological evidence on Precolumbian economy in the area.

{81} RADIOCARBON CHRONOLOGY OF THE LATER STONE AGE IN EAST AFRICA
The date of the transition from the Middle to the Late Stone Age in Africa is considered to have
occurred either around 40,000 B.P. or around 30,000 B.P. Charcoal from the uppermost Late Pleistocene
Late Stone Age layers at Twilight Cave (Central Rift Valley, Kenya) has been dated to 35,8004550 B.P.
The top of the Middle Stone Age horizon is two meters helow this date, indicating the Middle to Late
Stone Age transition took place well before 36,000 B.P. The context and associations of this date will
be described, and the continent-wide evidence for the Middle to Late Stone Age transition will be
reassessed.

[8] ASSEMBLAGE AND FEATURE DIVERSITY AMONG THE KUNG: IMPLICATIONS FOR
ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES OF FORAGER SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS
Archaeologists often imply settlement characteristics from relative heterogeneity of artifact as-
semblages. Artifact diversity has commonly been related to type of occupation, organization of
settlement system, length of occupation, and site reoccupation, as well as other aspects of site structure
and occupational history. Relationships of artifact and feature diversity among Kung camps reported
by Yellen (1977) are used to examine these variables so often used in interpreting hunter-gatherer
assemblages. Organizational factors such as functional site types and group composition, and situa-
tional factors of resource structure and game encounter, have significant effects on diversity measures
within foraging systems like the Kung.

{79] THE FALL OF CHICHEN ITZA: A PRELIMINARY HYPOTHESIS
Maya chronicles attribute the fall of Chichen Itza toa revolt in which native Yucatec Maya overthrew
the Itza and destroyed their capital, We have yet to identify the causes of the revolt, and the reasons
for the Itza failure to maintain a strong state in the northern lowlands. The likely causes may have
been an overexploitation of the internal economy of northern Yucatan coupled with the fact that the
Itza capital was too far removed from its primary sources of economic power, which was based on 4
contro! of coastal resources and access to long-distance trade networks.

that four types of coiled basketry and five structural types of cordage were made, used or discarded at
, Jackson 53
this special activity locus. Multidimensional scaling of metric attributes of this assemblage as well as
scrutiny of nominal attributes indicate that it is possible to isolate microshifts within the perishable
industries which may reflect either functional or, less likely, population based changes, Additionally,
comparison of the Lakeside perishables to those recovered from nearby Hogup Cave (42B036) and
Danger Cave (42T013) indicates that the populations which exploited these sites throughout their
coeval occupancy were different, Specifically, it appears that while Lakeside and Hogup Caves were
utilized by the same or very closely related groups, Danger Cave was visited by a different series of
populations.

[9] FROM ETHNICITY TO ECOLOGY: THE TRANSFORMATION OF BOUNDARIES IN THE
COPPER AGE OF THE SOUTHWESTERN USSR
Between about 4,000 and 3,000 B.C. the Dnieper River was perhaps the most clearly defined cultural
boundary in all of Europe, To the west were complex farmers living in substantial towns, practicing
metallurgy and sophisticated ceramic manufacture; while to the cast, in a comparable environment,
were simple incipient farmers still largely dependent on fishing and hunting, living in small hamlets
without advanced pyrotechnology, This apparent ethnic boundary disappeared after about 2,700 B.C.,
to be replaced by different but equally significant cultural separations that followed ecological
boundaries. The emergence of a recognizable Bronze Age “Barbarian Europe” was conditioned by this
shift in cultural trajectories in the southwestern USSR.

[29] FACTORS AFFECTING CERAMIC STANDARDIZATION
The notion of standardization in pottery production has recently been used as an indicator of ceramic
specialization, Yet, this notion and the assumptions behind it are still largely untested. An attempt to
identify some factors that affect the standardization of ceramic vessel shapes in Ticul, Yucatan is
described. Approximately 1,600 vesssels of 16 shapes were measured and analyzed statistically,
Interpretation of these analyses within the ethnographic context of the workshop industry in Ticul
provides insight into the factors associated with variability in cay Bran uniformity as a function of
market, technique, the individual potter-producer, the family and the potter's own views of stand-
ardization. We suggest that the coefficient of variation should not supplant the use of the standard
deviation as an expression of standardization.

to create a more ngorous and critical interpretation of the fourth millenium B.C. society in northeastern

Fundamental to any effective attempt to elucidate Classic Maya political organization are accurate
assessments of the functions performed by specific individual centers and of the organizational
relationships formerly existing among them. Smaller centers offer the potential for large proportion
sampling of multiple populations in establishing and verifying hypothetical functions and relation-

[13] STONE TOOLS AS STONE TOOLS: THE IMPORTANCE OF UTILITARIAN
CONSIDERATIONS IN LITHIC ANALYSIS
Recent research has substantially expanded the range of substantive and theoretical insights which
archaeologists can obtain from lithic analysis. However, much of this research has neglected 1) the
theoretical importance of the fact that stone tools were made to accomplish everyday tasks and not to
provide data for archaeologists, and 2) the practical requirements of taking account of these tasks,
whether we rely on intensive microwear analysis or not. This paper shows how this perspective changes
the conclusions of two recent theoretical studies and presents experimental and archaeological data
indicating some of the technical requirements of integrating it into our research.

[13] BURINS: TOOL OR TECHNIQUE?

A quantitative study of the morphology of burins from three Upper Paleolithic sites in southwestern
Asia permits a reexamination of the functional significance of this class of lithic artifacts. Results
suggest that “burination,” rather than being primarily a technique for creating graving tools, may
simply be an efficient means of altering flake or blade edges for a variety of purposes that include
resharpening, blunting, hafting, and preparing microblade cores in addition to making “burins” in the
classic sense. As burins are one of the most common Upper Paleolithic tool forms, this has important
implications for interpreting assemblages.

* [16] THE SPENCER-PIERCE-LITTLE HOUSE AND LANDS IN TIME AND MIND
The study of the Spencer-Pierce-Little property, approximately 230 acres of fields, marsh, and

land use over time. This paper presents the outlines of that approach and discusses how information
derived from modern vegetational and landscape surveys, archaeological and aerial reconnaissance,
documentary research, and remote sensing contributes to land use history of the site. This in turn is
combined with the subjective element of local lore about the house and grounds and the people who
worked and lived there. The resulting picture of changes in the land corresponding to changes in
perceptions of the land aids in interpreting the ways in which New Englanders created a mossaic of
cultural landscapes that were at once utilitarian and symbolic.

[55] ETHNIC BOUNDARIES AND THE COPENA MORTUARY COMPLEX

The Copena mortuary complex of northern Alabama was defined orginally by a trait list of burial

rare traits like the inclusion of copper reel-shaped gorgets, Recent analysis of the 50 excavated Copena
mounds has redefined Copena. The pattern of mortuary practices revealed through this research
suggests that Copena incorporated two distinct socioideological entities which were geographically,
and perhaps temporally, separated. The approach utilized in this analysis may prove of use elsewhere
for the identification of ethnic boundanes within the archaeological record.

The faunal remains of the Knox Site demonstrate a shift in fishing strategies in response to sea-level
rise, Initial occupation occurred during the Early Ceramic Period (2,700-2,000 B.P.) when sea level was
about two meters lower than today. Dominant fish include sculpin, a mudflat dweller most easily
harvested with a brush weir. The major occupation of the site occurred during the Middle Ceramic
Period (1,600-1,200 B.P.). Between 2,000 and 1,000 B.P., mean sea level was one meter lower than today.
Shoals and mudflats surrounding the Knox site during the Early Ceramic Period were inundated.
Atlantic cod is the dominant fish during this period, which can be caught in deep water with hook and
line. Sea level rose to its modern level and caused the abandonment of the Knox Site as a fishing locale,

[21] LITHIC RAW MATERIAL FREQUENCY; AN INSIGHT INTO THE MOBILITY PATTERNS
OF LATE QUATERNARY HUNTER-GATHERERS IN SOUTHERN SOMALIA
Archacologists have proposed that changes in hunter-gatherer mobility patterns across the Pleis-
tocene/Holocene boundary may relate to significant environmental changes. Recent research in
Ethiopia and Somalia indicates that the environment clanged from a cool and dry terminal Pleistocene
climate to a warm and humid Holocene climate. In response to this change, hunter-gatherers hypotheti-
cally contracted their mobility patterns due to significant increases in the abundance and concentration
of water, flora, fauna, and other critical resources, Focusing upon lithic raw material distribution and
use, this paper summarizes recent archaeological investigations in southern Somalia, examining this
relationship between environmental and cultural change.

Recent survey and excavation in the Black Desert of eastern Jordan illuminate the adaptive patterns

[59] OBSIDIAN EXCHANGE DURING THE HALAF AND URUK IN THE KHABUR DRAINAGE
The Khabur river has long been viewed as a major route linking the resource-rich areas of southeastern
Turkey with the Euphrates and beyond. Because of its geological rarity and chemical specificity to
source, obsidian has been used to document this exchange. Only a few obsidian samples from three
widely scattered sites in the Khabur region have actually been chemically assigned to specific sources.

[19] SOCIOCULTURAL IMPLICATIONS OF MORTUARY PATTERNS AND
PALEOPATHOLOGY AT A GLACIAL KAME SITE IN VERMONT
Results are presented of a bioarchaeological analysis of six-plus skeletons recovered in the 1960's at
the Isle La Motte site in Vermont. Partially described by Ritchie in 1969, the remains consist of three
intact and several cremated individuals with “typical” Glacial Kame grave goods. Although the
cremated remains exhibit postmortem cuts, they were not fleshed prior to burning. Radiographic
analysis of two of the intact individuals revealed lesional activity clearly indicative of disseminated
tuberculosis, The cranium of one evidences trephination associated with the lesions. Implications for
Glacial Kame mortuary practices and social organization are discussed.

[32] PREHISTORIC SOCIAL ORGANIZATION FROM DENTAL ENAMEL COMPOSITION: A
PRELIMINARY STUDY
Prehistoric residence and other behavior can be analyzed using dental enamel composition. Trace
elements in enamel reflect subsistence and geographic factors. Since most teeth form in childhood and
are stable thereafter, enamel composition reflects childhood environment. In this study, energy
dispersive x-ray analysis applied to permanent canines provides data on 11 trace elements, In each of
four protohistoric Arikara populations, the variance among adult men is much greater than for women
and children. The total pattern indicates that males left their natal village after age 16. This pattern
persists through the period covered in Deetz’s classic study,

[40] PALEOINDIAN AND EARLY ARCHAIC OCCUPATIONS AT THE FERONIA LOCALITY IN
SOUTH-CENTRAL GEORGIA
A rich record of Paleoindian and Early Archaic occupatjons has been recovered in south-central
Georgia from the surface of sixteen sites lying within an area biciecuatie only four square kilometers,
In-depth analysis of the lithic assemblages from these sites has provided information greatly expanding
our knowledge of early habitation in Coastal Plain Georgia and the Southeast at large. The density and
diversity of artifacts and sites suggests that this area was a locus of population aggregation. This
interpretation is supported through a discussion of toolkit composition, metric saute al raw
materials, and comparisons with other contemporaneous assemblages.

[54] SALES OUT THE FRONT DOOR, REJECTS OUT THE BACK: PRODUCTION AND DEBRIS
AT THE LINCOLN POTTERY WORKS
Excavation of the Lincoln Pottery Works—a firm that made domestic pottery in Lincoln, Nebraska
from 1881 until 1904—produceda large collection of imperfect crockery. To investigate the relationship
between this production debris and overall patterns of Lincoln Pottery Work’s production, the waster
assemblage was compared with the assemblage of plaster models from the site and a collection of vessels
bought at the factory. These comparisons show that both very simple and relatively complex vessel
types are underrepresented in Lincoln Pottery Work’s production debris. This research suggests some
general principles for the analysis of production debris at ancient or modern industrial sites.

[54] SCALE AND CONTEXT IN URBAN ARCHAEOLOGY: FREE BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD
FORMATION AND PRESERVATION
The use of a broader scale of anlaysis in urban archaeology, such as that of neighborhood, is facilitated

by archival research. Distinct free black residential areas developed between 1810 and 1850 in
Alexandria, Virginia. The recognition of neighborhood formation in relation to socioeconomic rank
distinctions within this population has implications for the interpretation of urban processes as well
as archaeological sites and their material culture in contexts of the larger whole. Preservation planners
concerned with protecting urban archaeological data must also be aware of patterning reflecting
differences in scale and context,

[47] EVALUATING SIZE AND AGE MORTALITY PROFILES AS CRITERIA FOR

DISTINGUISHING HOMINID SCAVENGING AND HUNTING
Size and age profiles of ungulate faunas at archaeological sites add a potentially incisive and

independent criterion for distinguishing hominid hunting and scavenging based on skeletal part
profiles, Existing uses of animal size and age profiles, however, do not provide adequate documentation
of the effects of predator-scavenger consumption on modifying age and size profiles prior to hominid
acquisition of carcasses (i.¢., scavenging), nor after hominid acquisition and carcass processing (hunting
or scavenging). Data from over 250 scavengeable carcasses in the Serengeti of Tanzania are used to
evaluate the efficacy of mortality profiles in assessing prehistoric hominid carcass acquisition.

[9] THE NEOLITHIC MOSAIC ON THE NORTH EUROPEAN PLAIN, 4,000-3,000 B.C.

Between 4,000 and 3,000 B.C. {unrecalibrated dates), the North European Plain saw the adaptation
of non-indigenous forms of domestic plants and both local and non-local species of livestock to an
environment unlike that hitherto encountered by farming populations in the Old World. At the same
time, much of this area was occupied by hunter-gatherer populations exploiting the rich lowland
environment. The establishment of agricultural communities modeled after those of the loess regions
to the south and the eventual emergence of indigenous agrarian communities is explored. A particular
emphasis is placed on information obtained from excavations in north-central Poland since 1984.

[55] NEOLITHIC CEMETERIES IN SOUTHWESTERN ASIA

While in the Paleolithic period of Southwestern Asia small bands of nomadic hunter-gatherers had
shared the benefits of their labors equally among themselves, during the Neolithic groups became
larger, more sedentary, began to labor intensively to produce food, and eventually created the institu-

, tions of resource ownership and its inheritance, by group or individual family. Growth of habitation
group size and change in the means and relations of production caused radical alterations in intragroup
relations, resulting in the creation of wealth and rank hierarchies, reinforced by the burial of the dead
in bounded cemeteries and distribution of grave goods among individuals.

[39] PALEOENVIRONMENTS FROM GLACIER ICE CORES
Glaciers and climate are inextricably linked through their paleoatmospheric records. Cores taken
from polar ice and lower latitude, high-altitude ice caps provide a record of snowfall. By analyzing their
chemistry, isotopic composition and atmospheric fallout including dust, pollen, volcanic tephra and
anthropogenic pollutants, we can observe both stratigraphic and radiometric evidence of paleoclimatic
and environmental conditions. Ice cores reveal climatic records spanning 150,000 years but highest
resolution is possible over the last 12,000 years. Because of this and the rapidly expanding field of
ice-core research, a new tool is emerging for the chronologic documentation of environments contem-
porary with prehistoric peoples.

[2] MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN WESTERN GERMANY
Evidence from recently excavated Middle Paleolithic sites in Western Germany is reviewed in terms
of the character of settlement patterns and the nature of activities undertaken on the sites. Several sites
show evidence for repeated occupations, with distinct concentrations of lithic materials, and evidence
for the movement of artifacts and raw materials between different sites or regions. In addition to
“settlement” locations, there is evidence for specialized “kill” sites (e.g., Lehringen) and raw material
extraction sites (e.g., Reutersruh). Evidence for these features is best reflected at open-air sites, which
allow a better separation of distinct episodes of occupation that more intensively occupied cave and
rock shelter sites.

[67] POLLEN, STABLE ISOTOPES AND PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTIONS IN
AFRICA
Stable carbon isotopes and pollen analysis provide an additional dimension for paleoenvironmental
reconstructions in Blydefontein Basin, South Africa. Matching pollen spectra and d13C values from
radiocarbon humate samples in geological contexts provide a finer grain analysis than by using pollen
or carbon isotopes individually. A second source of carbon isotopes, ostrich egg shell from an excavated
rockshelter, provides greater paleoenvironmental resolution, and is directly associated with ar-
chacological materials. Along with assessing human dietary changes via stable isotopes, environmental
fluctuations should be obtained and dated, especially in botanically heterogeneous areas or near isotopic
ecotanes, in order to eliminate background isotopic noise from dietary assessments.

The archaeology of women’s work in the heartland of the Aztec empire is examined. The intensity
of textile production is measured by the frequency of spindle whorls in the domestic refuse of five Late

particular, the archaeology of women’s work suggests variability and change not suggested by ethnohis-

Egyptian archaeologists have directed little effort to examining deposits of Old Kingdom (ca.

analytical unit. After an initial classification using field observable attributes, variability within deposit
classes is described in terms of differences in artifact density, deposit diversity, and particle size
distribution, At Kom el-Hisn this variability provides a means to distin guish high diversity, high density
“dumps,” from low diversity low density “house-floors.” The accretion of these and other classes of
deposits allows the depositional history of this Old Kingdom site to be reconstructed.

For the devout Spaniard the Conquest was legitimized by the fact that the natives of the New World
were introduced to the salvation-giving sacraments of the Roman Catholic Church. It is argued that
considerations of ritual, particularly of access to the sacraments, were what largely determined the
patterns of Christian Indian subsistence and settlement in La Florida. The Spanish view that seasonal
nomads and non-farming natives must be “reduced” to “regular” villages to live like Mediterranean
peasants “under the bell of their doctrina” effectively limited Spanish hegemony to those regions where
village-based agriculture was feasible.

Middle Paleolithic variability in Spain should be observed with reference to several points: site

they offer a greater spectrum of data. We also try to observe these aspects in comparison with certain

The ubiquitous Maya God C has been an enigma since it was first identified and discussed by

Based on the discovery that San Diego de Landa’s informant used the head of God C as the phonetic

proposed that God C functions both phonetically as k’u in Maya writing (ch’u in Chollan languages),
and in its root meaning of K’u, K’ul and Ch'ul—the embodiment or personification of the Maya concept
of god, divinity and the soul, God C was employed in titles such as emblem glyphs by the Maya Lords
to identify themselves as the divine descendents of ancestral gods through the direct inheritance of the

It is difficult to determine how Middle Paleolithic peoples made their living, because different

cannot be reconstructed because we cannot correlate different sites on a finer than geological time
scale. However, lithic raw material analyses have linked sites to other locations in the landscape
without requiring chronological correlation. The combined use of such studies with faunal data permits
inferences concerning patterns of human movement, of randomness versus specialization of activity,
and of the functional equivalence or complementariness of sites in the Middle Paleolithic of south-

[29] TRADITIONAL POTTERY PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION IN SOUTH HIGHLAND
PERU: IMPLICATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOGY

Villages in the lower valleys specialize in the production of containing and serving vessels, but do
not produce the fire-resistant pots that high elevation villages make. Such village specialization of
functionally complementary forms requires their distribution, assures interaction, and maintains
interdependency between the two ecozones. Pots are exchanged for agricultural produce from both
zones, Production and distribution occur primarily during the dry season when conditions are more
favorable, when such activities do not conflict with agricultural production, and when fairs occur. In
Cuzco the family is the pottery production unit, men and women specializing in different forms, and

\ intra-village distribution also occurs, Pottery enters a regional system of distribution through the fairs
scheduled by a religious (Catholic) calendar.

[38] SOMEONE IS ALWAYS GOING TO BE UNHAPPY WITH MY DECISIONS: A STATE
ARCHAEOLOGIST’S PERSPECTIVE ON ETHICS AND PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY
Professional standards can be difficult to reconcile with public expectations about what SHPO staff
archacologists should be doing (or not doing) in any given case of archaeological resource protection.
State Archaeologists often find themselves employing “archaeological triage” decision-making tech-
niques; yet, despite what some critics think, decisions are never made in a political or ethical vacuum.
Effective resolution of real-world problems of site protection or destruction demands ethical policies
and professional archaeological politics, plus media and public diplomacy skills. Staffing levels,
budgets, and moral support from fellow archaeologists are additional factors in the equation, Case
studies from North Carolina illustrate some of the realities of balancing professional mores with
political and economic development pressures.

[24] CONTINUITY OR REPLACEMENT? MIDDLE AND UPPER PALEOLITHIC ADAPTATIONS
IN THE LEVANT
Any general explanation for modern human origins must reconcile fossil and archaeological evidence,
and evidence from molecular biology. Levantine data are paradoxical in this regard since the Levant
has produced alleged “morphologically modern humans” TL-dated at ca. 92,000 B.P. at Qafzeh in
association with Mousterian archaeological assemblages indentical to those also found with alleged
“neanderthals.” Levantine Middle and Upper Paleolithic adaptations are outlined and contrasted in
order to determine if there is any evidence for the discontinuity implied by the biological replacement
models of Vandermecrsch, Bar-Yosef and others. The implications of biological replacement are
discussed, along with issues in molecular biology. Biological replacement of archaic Homo sapiens
with morphologically modern humans is not supported by the sparse fossi] evidence, nor the abundant
archaeological evidence. Biological replacement is also contradicted by all but one construal of the
controversial mtDNA data.

[5] CHANGING ADENA MORTUARY PRACTICES
Building on an understanding of Adena mortuary practices developed from the excavation of the Kirk

changes in mortuary practices through time are hypothesized. These draw on materials from later
Adena sites in the Kanawha Valley, Kentucky, and the Mid-Ohio Valley. It is suggested that through
time there is a wide spread development in the importance of Aneage mortuary facilities. This trajectory
of change is then related to patterns of Hopewellian mortuary practice which followed in the Ohio
Valley.

The stone adze was the most important woodworking tool in precontact Hawaiian society. Raw

I [45] MULTI-STAGE RESEARCH IN THE SITING AND ASSESSMENT OF LINEAR PROJECTS
Appropriate approaches to archaeological studies in support of the siting of linear projects remain an
j unresolved issue in historic preservation planning. There is tremendous variation from project to
\ project and jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the degree to which archacological information is factored
! into the initial identification of project alternatives. Similarly, approaches to the assessment of impacts
‘ along alternative corridors varies considerably. Controversies regarding the appropriate role of predic-
‘ tive modeling and sample surveys contribute to the lack of clear direction amongst professional
! archaeologists. Many archaeologists are only vaguely aware that the requirements of the National
{ Environmental Policy Act are substantially different than those of the National Historic Preservation
; Act. The Geothermal Public Power Line project in northern California is reviewed as an example where
" a multi-stage archaeological research strategy, encompassing predictive modeling, sample survey, and
5 intensive survey, was utilized at various planning stages. Using Geographic Information Systems
provides improved ability to relate corridor level data to the understanding of regional settlement

{26] THE PALYNOLOGY AND ARCHAEOBOTANY OF CERROS, BELIZE
The Cerros archaeobotanical remains document changing patterns of plant utilization during the
Late Preclassic occupation of this site. By stage four there was 4 decline in the utilization of maize and
an increase in the consumption of probable imported tree crops. These changes may have been the
result of the Cerrosanos’ participation in regional trade and the development of a central market place
at the site. The Cerros pollen record documents a gradual deforestation of the site which correlates
with the growth of the site and the relocation of a large segment of the population necessitated by the
construction of the ceremonial center.

Cremation was a rare form of mortuary treatment during the Late Pithouse and Classic periods in
the Mimbres area. During these periods (ca. A.D. 550-1 150}, cremations were interred in special rooms
or in special areas within the community proportionately more often than were inhumations; and
cremations were much more likely to have projectile points accompanying them. These facts and the
rare occurrence of cremation during these periods are perhaps most easily attributed to unusual
conditions of death, although the extant data do not permit a wholly satisfactory evaluation of this
possibility.

[65] THE ROLE OF REGIONAL-SCALE ANALYSIS IN CLIMATIC CHANGE
An important component in any definition of region is its climate, and the prospect of global climatic
change renders previous static definitions (both physiographic and cultural] inadequate. A temporally
and spatially dynamic definition of region, based on the area’s ecological history, is proposed. Among
several advantages, the utility of a dynamic concept of region lies in its ability to focus global climatic
changes of a scale comprehensible to most people and roughly commensurate with extant institutions.
Archaeology and related fields amass the information necessary to construct regional-scale ecological
histories and to identify effective coping strategies for the future.

ECONOMY OF EARLY IRON AGE SOUTHERN FRANCE
The adoption of elements of Greek and Etruscan culture by Early tron Age indigenous peoples of
southern France, a process commonly (and incorrectly) described as “Hellenization,” was neither
passive nor random, but a creative transformation of two specific aspects: objects related to drinking
wine and techniques used in pottery manufacture. The explanation of this selective demand for exotic
cultural elements, and of the social effects stemming from their adoption, lies in the native political
economy. The social meaning and role of the two ceramic wares ("Pseudo-lonian” and “ceramique
grise”) which were developed after contact (by combining imported techniques and a mixture of exotic
and native forms) are assessed through examination of their relation to demand for imported wine and
of their place in indigenous patterns of consumption in general.

of the commonalities and differences in Islander-Euroamerican contact, exchange, and interaction.
Drawing from both archaeological and ethnographical data, the importance of indigenous stratification
systems is examined in the structuring of, and the response to, contact period exchanges between
Islanders and Euroamericans.

[71] LANDSCAPE UTILIZATION: AN EVOLUTIONARY PERSPECTIVE
The use of the term sedentism in cultural evolutionary studies of prehistoric hunter-gatherers has
become increasingly common during the past decade, Concern with the origin of sedentism has often
become a goal in itself serving to shift research away from the explanation of spatial and temporal
variation in landscape utilization. We review the development of the sedentism concept and propose
an alternative approach that stresses the dynamics of regional positioning strategies. Changes in these

[50] BARBUDA, LESSER ANTILLES: SHORELINE CHANGE BEFORE AND DURING
PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC OCCUPATION

The island of Barbuda, Lesser Antilles, demonstrates progradation or expansion through time. The
eastern three-fourths of the island originated in Mio-Pliocene time and expanded from the east through
the Pleistocene. Integration of geologic and prehistoric occupation data strongly suggest that the
western one-fourth of the island, the Lagoon and Palmetto Point, originated after occupation. A
sequence of historic maps demonstrates unequivocally that Palmetto Point is continuing to expand in
a southward direction.

[66] SETTLEMENT, SEASONALITY, AND SITE FUNCTION IN THE ITALIAN FINAL
EPIGRAVETTIAN

As in other regions and in other periods of the Paleolithic, controversy emerges over attempts to
explain the variability among Italian Final Epigravettian (14,000-8,000 B.P.) assemblages. Analysis of
lithic artifacts from Paglicci cave indicates that a strong association exists between certain artifact
types and specific tool functions and activities. Given this, and our understanding of activities,
seasonality, and site function, a comparative study of Final Epigravettian site assemblages provides
strong support for Barker’s model of hunter-gatherer seasonal transhumance with upland summer sites
and lowland winter sites. It also demonstrates strongly that there exists within each of these
topographic zones a simple dichotomy of base camps and hunting camps.

[61] A REEVALUATION OF NONLOCAL CERAMICS AT PAQUIME (CASAS GRANDES) IN
CHIHUAHUA, MEXICO, AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR REGIONAL INTERACTION

The relatively high percentage of nonlocal ceramics at Paquime (Casas Grandes) has been considered
an indication that the prehistoric settlement served an as a hub of interaction within the southern
Greater Southwest, particularly within the Northern Sierra region. After examining the assumptions
underlying this formulation, the distribution of nonlocal ceramics at Paquime are anlayzed through
time and space |i,e., differences between room groups). Not until the last prehistoric phase in the
sequence is there evidence of a sizeable increase in nonlocal ceramics and a nonrandom distribution
of these ceramics between room groups. Alternative hypotheses for explaining the observed pattern
are presented. 4

[61] PREHISTORIC INTER-REGIONAL CERAMIC EXCHANGE IN SOUTHERN ARIZONA

Between A.D. 750-1050, interregional ceramic exchange among the prehistoric Hohokam of southern
Arizona cross-cut major drainage systems. Between 1050 and 1250, non-local ceramic exchange
between the Salt and the Gila River valleys appears to diverge, while covergence in non-local ceramic
assemblages is apparent for the 1250 to 1450 period. The results of analysis of non-Hohokam ceramics
recovered from Snaketown, Pueblo Grande, Las Colinas and other Hohokam villages are used to
evaluate the recent hypothesis that the major rivers in southern Arizona served as barriers to
interregional non-Hohokam ceramic exchange.

[15] SCALES OF ANALYSIS IN ZOOARCHAEOLOGY
Most zooarchaeological analysis is conducted at the site level and most interpretation is undertaken

in a cultural-ecological framework. In this paper it is argued that one of the problems which has
inhibited the growth of zooarchaeology is the mis-match of scale of analysis and interpretative
framework. Using examples from Britain and North America it is demonstrated that while inter-site
or inter-regional variation is best understood in terms of cultural ecological models, inter-feature or
intra-site variation must be examined in terms of refuse disposal patterns, and inter-context or
intra-feature variation requires an understanding of the changing functions of features over short time
spans.

PALEOINDIAN SITES IN FLORIDA WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO THE OUTER
CONTINENTAL SHELF

Ninety percent of the known Paleoindian sites in Florida containing Clovis, Suwannee or Simpson
points and associated artifacts are located near karst depressions that penetrate the limestone aquifer.

This distribution of Clovis/Suwannee sites indicates settlement patterns were centered where natural

resources were most abundant, particularly potable water and lithic supplies. Given the difficulties

associated with locating offshore sites, the model based on the type and distribution of sites on the
adjacent coast will be reviewed and potential for locating Paleoindian site clusters in the Eastern Gulf

[11] THE GEOGRAPHY OF POWER IN THE TERMINAL CLASSIC, NORTHERN PUUC, MEXICO
Analysis of new survey data from the northern Puuc suggest a seven-tiered settlement hierarchy,
with major sites spaced at eight to twelve kilometer intervals; smaller sites cluster near surrounding
zones of productive soils and near the conjectural boundaries of major site polities. The regional
settlement hierarchy changed through time, culminating in the development of Uxmal as a regional

ensure rainfall and agricultural productivity. Precariously high Terminal Classic populations made the
region vulnerable to agricultural failure and threatened the stability of the socio-political system.

[72] WATER, TRADE AND URBANISM ON THE LITTORAL OF THE ARABIAN GULF
Urban settlement in the Arabian Gulf responds to two principal intersecting factors—water and trade.
Free access to water allows development of agriculture and relatively dense populations, Interregional
trade flows through these population centers, thereby enhancing generation of wealth, political power
and urban forms of life. Waterless areas lack an indigenous agricultural base, and in the absence of a
local product of value also the means to enter interregional trade. These constraints were overcome in
the later first millennium B.C, At that time pearling greatly intensified in response to growing
interregional demand, permitting emergent urban polities based on imported foodstuffs. These themes
are developed using Qatar as an example.

Recent fieldwork in western Kentucky has yielded substantial new data on Mississippian botanical

important since the analysis of such remains is conspicuously absent from many major Mississippian
| towns excavated in the past. New botanical and faunal data from four Mississippian towns in western
Kentucky are compared with substantial data from smaller sites which has been collected in adjacent
regions of the Mid-South. Apparent cultural differences, often based on artifact assemblages and
settlement patterns, are reviewed in light of subsistence economies practiced in the Late Prehistoric
Mid-South.

[34] METALLURGICAL WORKSHOPS: PRODUCTION IN THE FOOTHILL SETTLEMENTS OF
NORTHEASTERN ITALY
A long chain of small, foothill settlements has been discovered bordering two geographically and
culturally distinct zones in northeastern Italy. Two findings are significant: 1) the metallurgically-based
communities of the mountains thrived on the trade of the metals produced from the rich, indigenous
ore sources; 2) the agriculturally-based settlements in the Po Valley were the first Early Iron Age centers
to form large proto-urban settlements. The foothill settlements survived by refining and finishing the
resources obtained from each area before trading these products to the larger neighboring regions. The
ethnic and economic basis of survival for these culturally distinct boundary sites will be discussed
using data from the metallurgical workshop at Santorso.

[41] QUARRY PITS AND BIFACE CACHES: IMPLICATIONS FOR MODELS OF LITHIC
PROCUREMENT AND TRANSPORTATION
The weight and density of toolstone limits the amount of lithic material that an individual can
transport, Recent research at Tosawihi (White Knife) Quarries (26EK3032) in north central Nevada
suggest that one solution to this problem is a mixed strategy involving both “direct” and “embedded”
lithic procurement. Episodes of intensive quarrying are relatively infrequent, although perhaps of
several days duration. During these episodes, large amounts of processed toolstone are produced in the
form of flake blanks and bifaces. What cannot be immediately transported is cached at the quarry to
be retrieved as needed, without the necessity of further excavation.

tion patterns of faunal resources. Although each faunal assemblage consists of more than 95 percent
reindeer, evidence from body part representation, cut marks, and bone breakage suggest immediate
consumption of kills in the earlier case and preparation for storage in the later case. This contrast would
be consistent with a shift from a foraging type of organization to one of logistical collecting. Site

animal foods is less settled. A “Mesolithic Plant Food Consumption Model,” originally stimulated by

analysis of settlement structure, architectural and mortuary variability. Using ceramic stylistic
variability as a measure of information flow within a system, the role of information processing related

[43] CHEROKEE ANIMAL CLASSIFICATIONS; CORRELATES TO THE CHEROKEE
ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD

Folk semantic analyses may be correlated with the study of faunal remains recovered from protohis-
toric and historical archaeological sites. The language and culture of the Cherokee Indians living in the
Overhill towns in eastern Tennessee during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries serve as the
subject for the present study, Cherokee animal classifications are examined as a means of gaining
insight into the significance of particular animals within the Cherokee culture. Such findings, in turn,
are compared to the Cherokee zooarchacological record. The latter consists of faunal samples recovered
from the Cherokee Chota and Citico sites.

{2} MOUSTERIAN FACIES: IMPLICATIONS OF MORIN LEVEL 16

Excavations conducted at Cueva Morin (Cantabria, Spain) during 1968-69 produced some 307
“essential” (Bordes’ term] retouched tools from an area seven square meters in extent. An immediately
adjacent area of the same level measuring six square meters was opened during the excavation of an
Aurignacian burial in 1970-71, yielded 227 more. Analyzed separately, these two partial assemblages
would be assigned two different “facies,” and the difference between them is statistically significant.
In the case of Morin 16, at least, spatial segregation of tasks seems a greater probable contributor to the
apparent “facies” difference than other factors.

fil] TLALOC WAR AND THE TRIUMPH OF THE CONFEDERACY AT CHICHEN ITZA

Tlaloc-Venus War is a gloss for a Maya military code aimed at the conquest and subjugation of rival
kingdoms, Great Jaguar Paw of Tikal introduced the gomplex of foreign symbols and concepts
legitimating Tlaloc war in his successful conquest of acieeun on January 16, 378 A.D. Later Classic
kings used Tlaloc-Venus war, generating significant—if temporary—territorial hegemonies. The Ter-
minal Clasic Chichen Itza lords succeeded in establishing an enduring, large-scale conquest state using
Tlaloc war, We attribute the Chichen Itza success to the replacement of the principle of rqyal dynasty
with that of rule by council—multepal.

[46] THE ROLE OF RURAL SETTLEMENT ANALYSIS AT THE MAYA CENTER OF COPAN,

HONDURAS

The importance of rural settlement analysis in reconstructing the evolutionary processes among the
Classic period Maya at Copan is considered. Based on data from six years of rural settlement survey
and test pit excavations, and augmented by over 2,000 obsidian hydration dates, the settlement history
of the Copan valley from 600-1200 A.D. is summarized. These regional settlement data are shown to
significantly alter previous interpretations involving Mayan economic, social and political institutions
as well as the growth and collapse of this complex society.

[47] PREHISTORIC HIGH PLAINS HUNTING STRATEGIES BASED ON MORTALITY STUDIES
FROM FAUNAL REMAINS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AND ANIMAL BEHAVIORAL
STUDIES

Mammoth, bison, deer, pronghorn, mountain sheep and elk comprise most large mammal remains
in High Plains archaeological sites. Except for mammoths, these species or closely-related sub-species
are extant in their natural habitats. Mammoth procurement models using wild elephant behavior
should be treated with caution but procurement of the other species can be understood based on their
observable behavioral characteristics. This is overly simplified because animal behavior changes with
age, sex, season, weather, etc, However, with sex, age, and seasonality data from sites, these can be
combined with known anima! behavior to provide more reliable prehistoric animal procurement
models.

[10] IMPERIAL STYLE AND SYMBOLISM OF POWER: A SOUTH INDIAN EXAMPLE

Certain of the arts produced in empires are related to systems of meaning that constitute royal
authority. Specific built forms and pictorial themes together with their contexts are symbolic forms
which define the center of social action and link it to transcendent principles of order. During the

Vijayanagara Empire (ca. 14th-17th centuries, south India) styles were evolved in urban layout, in civic

and religious architecture, and in the decorative arts which asserted the sacral and generative roles of
rulers. Here, evolving style can be ritually interpreted through indigenous texts and foreign visitor's
accounts. Examples are briefly discussed.

On two notable occasions in the sixteenth century Franciscan friars in the Florida mission system
took successful action to defend the human, civil, and religious rights of the native populations against
the depredations of provincial governors. In the first instance they opposed Governor Diego de
Rebolledo (1655-1659) and his practice of enslaving Apalachee natives as burden bearers to carry corn
and other products one hundred leagues to the provincial capital of St. Augustine, Their protests to the
King resulted in Rebolledo’s removal from office and detention in Havana, where he died. In the second
instance friars in the field defended native rights against similar outrages committed against them by
: Governor Juan Marquez Cabrera (1680-1687), as a result of their defense Marquez, too, was removed
from office and held under arrest in Havana.

DIFFERENTIATION IN COLONIAL SOCONUSCO, NEW SPAIN
For colonial period Mesoamerica an understanding of household economic differentiation is best
achieved through the combined use of documentary and archaeological data. Colonial wills and other
documents containing household inventories provide information about material culture not readily
available in the archaeological record alone. Not only are perishable materials (c.g., textiles, leather
goods, and wooden objects) recorded in documents, but frequently the monetary values of household
items also appear, This paper, which examines variability among households in colonial Soconusco,
New Spain, illustrates how household inventories, together with archaeological data can be effectively
used to study the colonial household economy.

When the Middle Kingdom Theban noble Meketre died some time after 2,000 B.C., three of the
wooden tomb models interred with his body depicted activities associated with the care, feeding, and
slaughter of cattle. Assuming accuracy of sculptural detail, the cattle models provide much information
relevant to ancient Egyptian beef production, including aspects of selection for slaughter, pastoral
accounting, growth rates, finishing schedules, butchering procedures, and the handling of meat and
blood. While zooarchacologists have rightly been cautious in interpreting animal exploitation through
representation alone, the present case shows how informed investigation of such art can yield detailed
hypotheses, osteological implications of which may be tested against relevant faunal assemblages.

NORTHEAST THAILAND: THE EVIDENCE FROM BAN CHIANG
A combination of technological analyses of pottery, especially addressing manufacturing methods,
from the site of Ban Chiang in northeastern Thailand have revealed three major technological stages
of development during the site’s occupation (ca. 3,000 B.C.-A.D. 200). A decrease in the number of
manufacturing methods occurs simultaneously with other material culrure developments. The
ceramic data suggest either a “household industry” or ” individual workshop” production level, and
reflect at least two potting traditions. Only one of these traditions has been documented elsewhere in
the region. This emerging picture suggests a complex set of factors is involved in ceramic production,
including craft specialization, exchange, regionalism and ethnicity.

[51] INTERASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY OF THE AURIGNACIAN IN CENTRAL EUROPE
The Aurignacian in Centra! Europe differentiates into two different facies: open-air sites that are
dominated by a single faunal species, reindeer (Llommersum, Breitenbach), and have few bone tools,
and cave sites that have varied faunal assemblages and are rich in bone and antler tools as well as beads
and art objects. Different activities, seasonal occupations and general site functions produce as-
semblages which cannot be interpreted as being chronologically or culturally distinct,

| |4] CERAMICS AND SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION AMONGST PREHISTORIC HOUSEHOLDS
IN LA MIXTEQUILLA, VERACRUZ, MEXICO
| A program of intensive survey, collection, and excavations in the Mixtequilla region of southern
Veracruz has defined a dense residential occupation interspersed with numerous ceremonial centers,
comprising a long occupation span. Excavations in one Terminal Classic period mound uncovered
remains of a domestic structure collapsed on a deposit of serving vessels and elite and imported
houschold wares. This material is compared with surface collections from residential mounds, in
relation to such factors as occupation period, mound size and height, and distance to nearest center,
mn order to define the nature of social differentiation throughout the Mixtequilla region.

152] INVESTIGATING ARCHAIC SETTLEMENT IN MIDDLE TENNESSEE
Data derived from extensive non-site surface survey are used to explore Middle and Late Archaic
settlement pattern dynamics along the Duck River in Middle Tennessee. The separate tasks of site
Gefinition, temporal determination, and assemblage composition comparison, are discussed as they
relate to the primary goal of discovering factors effecting settlement location. A strictly quantitative
approach is employed to assess both the gravitational effect of descrete features of the landscape, and
the degree of fit between empirical spatial patterns and those predicted by optimization models.

{1} THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL REALITY OF DE SOTO’S COOSA
According to the de Soto narratives, the province of Coosa consisted of at least eleven named towns
and groups of towns and required 24 days to traverse, According to archaeological evidence, the province
consisted of eight spatially distinct clusters of sites. These clusters had a number of common features,
sncluding geographical size, number of component sites, and ecological setting. Most seem to be the
end product of distinctive ceramic micro-traditions s ting that they were loosely incorporated into
the province. Province integration may be indicated bathe geographical distribution of certain status
ttems found in burials.

[56] INTERPRETING DEFLATED FEATURES OF THE PAST: INTRASITE PATTERNING IN A
MULTI-COMPONENT SITE FROM CENTRAL PANAMA
Extensive archaeological research at the 218 hectare site of La Mula-Sarigua, Central Pacific Panama, ;
has yielded evidence for considerable intrasite variation—variation which is the product of perhaps
10,000 years of occupation, An analysis of the density and distribution of the evidence indicates that,
despite a largely eroded and deflated context, size, age, function and internal patterning can be
discerned. The goals of this paper are threefold: 1) to outline the mapping techniques used in delineating
the density and distribution of materials, 2) to describe the clusters recognized and 3) to interpret ;
internal ogranization relative to the growth and collapse of settlement at La Mula-Sarigua.

” FRANCISCANS IN UNCOVERING THE TRACES OF THE FRANCISCAN PROVINCE OF
SANTA ELENA
: With the 1763 evacuation of a few remaining friars from St. Augustine ended one of the first
systematic efforts to bring Christianity to the native population of the future United States. As part of
that effort, five friars had given their lives in 1597 on St. Catherines and St. Simons Islands and the
nearby Georgia mainland. One Franciscan here investigates questions related to the “martyrdom”: 1)
were the natives sufficiently exposed to Christian teaching to contest doctrine; 2) was their action
against the friars merely a civil revolt; and 3) did the missionaries provoke their fate by an imprudent
use of authority?

[37] BUENA VISTA LAKE: FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO “LACUSTRINE

ADAPTATIONS”

Lacustrine environments have long been regarded as optimal {i.c., highly ranked) habitats for
hunter-gatherers because of their stable, diverse, and abundant resources. More recently, however, it
has been argued that lakes and lake margins do not provide that stable, rich resource base once assumed.
In consideration of this debate archaeological investigations were recently conducted in the vicinity of
Buena Vista Lake in the southern San Joaquin Valley of California. The lake microenvironment has
played a significant role in the adaptive strategies of hunter-gatherer populations occupying the area
over the past 8,000 years. Analysis of data generated from this study, when considered in light of a
reanalysis of previous local research, suggests that the inherent qualities of the lake environment
cannot wholly account for the patterns seen. It is argued that the use of lacustrine resources is tied to
such features of human organization as technology, scheduling of resource use within an area, and
ultimately population density.

psychology, subjective probability and decision making under uncertainty. Interpretation of human
responses in the past provides a basis for evaluating current and possible future reactions to climatic
crises.

/18] FOOD AND GENDER IN PREHISTORY

im most societies the family, centered around adult females and males, is the unit of production and

Saterial in the residence. If gender is created in the daily living quarters and a main occupation of the
Seusehold is to feed its members, then food should be a significant medium for determining and

[47] MEGAMAMMAL AGE PROFILES: MEANING OR AMBIGUITY?

With wild animals, especially the megamammials, different mortality (age) profiles result from
different causes of death, although trends in population growth or decline also affect the profiles. Age
profiles from fossil collections may or may not clearly reflect human selectivity in preying on game
populations. African elephant death samples (noncultural or cultural in origin) are characterized by
three or four distinctively shaped mortality profiles. Profiles seen among large samples of free-roaming
black rhino, Cape buffalo, American bison, and feral Camelus differ greatly when selective predation
or environmentally caused mass kills account for deaths,

[45] THE DULLES SITES: PROPOSED HIGHWAY CORRIDORS REVEAL LATE ARCHAIC
SPATIAL ORGANIZATION

Cultural resources survey for a proposed highway in Northern Virginia has generated about 40 miles
of Phase I survey and Phase IJ testing of 17 archaeological sites during the assessment of three alternative
alignments. Significant Late Archaic period sites have been found. Among these are a site including
evidence of a large structure and a related special activity site. These sites, other sites covered by the

highway project, and previous surveys of adjacent areas hold evidence of intensive occupation of the
area. Investigations there have shown a surprising degree of sedentism for a minor tributary drainage.
In contrast, the accepted view has been that semi-permanent settlements existed only on major river
bottoms, where evidence for structures has been scarce.

[19] EARLY WOODLAND PERIOD RITUAL USE OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT AT THE
BOUCHER SITE
Recent analyses of artifacts and mortuary practices at the Boucher cemetery (VT-FR-26) in
. northwestern Vermont have produced unique data about the ritual use of personal adornment in
mortuary contexts during the Early Woodland period. Many interments included lavish amounts of
copper beads and marine shell beads and omaments, The copper artifacts created unusual conditions
of preservation which enabled recovery of highly perishable artifact categories, including basketry or
fabrics, cordage, and hide specimens. Emphasized are the artifact categories related to personal
garmentry and ornamentation and the spatial relationships of these artifacts to individual interments.
Taken in concert, these analyses are used to reconstruct site-specific mortuary practices and broader
regional patterns.

wheras the lower clevation (900m) site of Tor Faraj is interpreted as a longer term cold season
secupation. Furthermore, it is suggested that opportunistic “foraging” and logistically structured
“collecting” procurement strategies were governed by the season of occupation.

[47] IDENTIFYING NON-SELECTIVE, SMALL GAME HUNTING STRATEGIES IN THE

To distinguish archaeologically between hunting, scavenging, and natural death assemblages, we
must understand the formation of faunal assemblages associated with a wide variety of hunting
techniques. Enthnoarchaeological data from a moder tropical forest foraging group, the Aka pygmies
of the Central African Republic, are examined to identify processes which produce the faunal
assemblages characteristic of non-selective, smal! game hunting. Faunal assemblages from a net-hunt-

between two and twenty-five kilograms. Analysis focuses on species size, age and patterning in the

[39] TREE RINGS AS RECORDS OF LARGE-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS
There is growing evidence that dendrochronologically dated tree-ring series may be used as temporal-
ly very precise records of some large-scale environmental events during approximately the last 8,000
years. For example, some explosive volcanic eruptions inject large enough quantities of certain
materials into the upper atmosphere to produce marked climate changes on a hemispheric or perhaps
global scale for a year or more. Such eruptions may be recorded variously in frost-damaged rings,
low-density late wood and suppressed radial growth in regions as far apart as California, northern
Canada, and Ireland. It has been suggested that the eruption of Santorini in the Eastern Mediterranean
during the mid-17th century B.C. was recorded in this way. The basis for connecting tree-ring records
to such climatic events will be explored as will the potential for their use in examining impacts on
humans.

[74] SOME METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES OF EXCHANGE IN OCEANIC PREHISTORY
Explaining the role of exchange and interaction in the evolution of Oceanic societies will require the
solution of two methodological problems. The first of these is the identification of commodities moved.
Identification requires compositional characterization, in some cases permitting geologic sourcing. The
, ‘ Irwin, Geoffrey 99
second problem is less amenable to a technical fix. It involves linking patterns of exchange (deduced
from distributional data) with models for the origins of social complexity in island settings.

[39] A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR THE IDENTIFICATION OF RESIDUAL BLOOD ON
ARTIFACTUAL MATERIALS
Recent advances in molecular biological techniques have enabled researchers to indentify the species
of origin of blood residues found on archaeological materials. The enzyme immunoassay technique,
developed by the Cultural Resource Management Program of the University of Pittsburgh, utilizes a
nitrocellulose protein-binding membrane and affinity absorbed antibodies, and avoids many of the
; problems inherent in other types of assays. Samples eluted from an endscraper collected at the Shoop
site (11,0008B,P.), central Pennyslvania, have been positively identified as belonging to the cervidfamily.
Research on genus determination of this sample is discussed as well as new methods of protein recovery
and antibody purification. The ramifications of the successful implementation of this technique are
discussed in terms of Paleoindian artifact function and paleoeconomic, paleoenvironmental, and
paleodietary reconstruction using a case study from the Shoop site in central Pennsylvania.

Obsidian and chert artifacts from the Teotihuacan Merchants’ Barrio were analyzed to determine: |)
flaked stone tool manufacturing processes and 2) other economic activities taking place at the site; 3)
the extent and nature of the foreign contacts of its inhabitants; and 4) evidence of internal and external
differences in social status. Technological analysis indicates most tools were produced within one of
four industries, in proportions atypical of Classic Teotihuacan, and small numbers appear to have been
imported from as far as the Maya region. een residues on working edges are suggestive of low-level

[64] DEFINING THE ECONOMY FOR THE STUDY OF EARLY PALEOINDIANS
Two concerns expressed by archaeologists to the editor of Research in Economic Anthropology are
examined: 1) the differences between cultural ecology and economic anthropology, and 2) the scope of .
economic analysis. Economy is treated as the specific mechanisms and processes—production, con-
sumption (use}, distribution, exchange—of human ecological adaptation, economy is neither
synonymous with nor restricted to food subsistence in primitive economies, any more than it is in our
own case. The relevance of modern hunter-gatherers to the study of Paleoindian economies is assessed,
especially with respect to optimal foraging models.

RECENT RESULTS FROM THE CHILDERS/WOODS PROJECT
A common argument holds that labor requirements of economic practices determine settlement
patterns in small-scale agricultural societies. Specifically, extensive agriculture is linked to aggregated
settlement and intensive agriculture to dispersed settlement. This reasoning is evaluated in the study
of Childers and Woods of Late Woodland sites on the Ohio River in West Virginia. Economic practices
are documented through detailed studies of faunal, botanical, lithic and ceramic assemblages. Particular
attention is paid to changes in resource diversity associated with agricultural intensification. Settle-

Upper Mississippian lithic technology is characterized by a lack of formal tool types. Triangular

the Upper Midwest. Time and energy stresses inherent in a marginal horticultural society did not allow
for an energy-intensive lithic procurement and reduction strategy. An expedient, bipolar technology
was utilized to reduce locally available, poor quality lithic resources, Data from several sites are used
to examine the relationship between social organization and energy input into lithic technology.

The late fourth millennium witnessed cultural development of unprecedented scale and complexity
over much of greater Mesopotamia. This was a period of only a few generations in which we recognize
the remarkable formal similarity in material culture from southwestern Iran to the upper Euphrates.

| Late Uruk is usually viewed as a period of expansion in which a polity or set of polities sought to control

access to scarce and valuable materials in regions beyond resource-poor Mesopotamia. It is suggested
that processes of collapse may better account for the available data from Umm Qseir and other sites
of ostensible expansion.

Archaeologists are now beginning to realize the value of phytolith research. Studies to date, however,
have centered almost exclusively on silica or opal phytoliths. Research has demonstrated that calcium
oxalate druse and raphide crystals, produced in many plants, are proving to be taxonomically identifi-
able and thereby useful to the archaeologist. Though studies have centered largely on the Cactaceae, |
Liliaceae and Amaryllidacese families, subsequent research has shown that calcium oxalate crystals
are present in a wide variety of plants. Frequently preserved in coprolites and dry cave sediments, these
phytoliths can offer insights into the diet and lifestyles of prehistoric peoples.

Food resources are often widely scattered in the Great Basin, and ethnographic accounts report great

foods indicate that there is great variation between different resources in the food value that could be
readily transported using aboriginal technology. The studies show that the food that could be gathered
most efficiently is not necessarily the most likely candidate for transport. Hypotheses about which
resources were most likely transported are tested against archaeological data on resource presence in
sites and the location of probable acquisition.

Archacological and sedimentological research in the Lower Rio Verde Valley indicates that geomor-

tions. Late Formative population growth and agricultural intensification in the upper drainage basin
resulted in increased erosion and runoff into the drainage system. This caused a rapid channel shift of
the Lower Rio Verde as well as increased flooding and alluvial deposition on the floodplain. Settlement
locations followed the changing position of the river and the greatly increased input of alluvial deposits
on the floodplain raised agricultural productivity leading to population growth and increasing social
stratification.

resources, These combinations, as styles, are argued to reflect the social meaning attributed by
producers and consumers to the pottery thus manufactured.

The transition from the Middle Classic to Late Classic period at Matacapan is marked by changes in
the anthropomorphic figurine record, particularly with the development of fine orange, mold-made
whistle and rattle figurines, a tradition which differs technologically, stylistically, and in subject matter
frorn earlier traditions. Female figurines, rare at Matadepan during the Middle Classic, are reemphasized
and substantially outnumber male figurines. Ethnohistoric and archaeological data are used to suggest
that these figurines are not meant to represent reproduction, fertility, or specific goddesses, but rather
the growing importance of cloth production for Late Classic Mesoamerican states. The appropriation
of cloth production, traditionally a female activity in wre domestic sphere, and its links to political
centralization and interregional economic activity are discussed.

[46] SMALL SITES IN PREHISTORIC MAYA SOCIOECONOMIC ORGANIZATION: A

PERSPECTIVE FROM COLMA, BELIZE
Traditional approaches to prehistoric Maya socioeconomic organization implicitly rely on certain

assumptions about the relative complexity of large and small sites. Large sites are expected to exhibit
marked functional diversity, economic specialization, and social differentiation. This complexity is
thought to have evolved from their early control over critical resources. Smal] sites, by contrast, are
viewed as structurally more homogeneous, dependent on the large sites for specialized service and
products. Recent data from the small site of Colha, Belize, challenge these assumptions. This paper
discusses problems with the traditional view and suggests alternative perspectives on Maya

[17] SPATIAL ANALYSIS AT LE FLAGEOLET I (DORDOGNE): A PRELIMINARY LOOK AT
THREE DIMENSIONAL PATTERNING
Traditional methods of spatial analysis are generally applied to those sites which are amenable to
deflation into two horizontal dimensions. Couche IX at the Magdalenian site of Le Flageolet Ul
(Dordogne) is internally undifferentiated and some 60 centimeters thick. Preliminary study of spatial
patterning in three dimensions supports the general utility of several established spatial analysis
techniques when applied to three dimensional data. Results from K-means cluster based formation,
| and subsequent analysis using measures of homogeneity and correlation, suggest the potential of this
approach for the recovery of sets of independently deposited materials from sites whose general
depositional reconstruction may appear otherwise intractable.

One possible response to resource depletion in this situation is to limit resource access. Field houses
in the Southwest are usually considered to be devices for minimizing travel distance to and from distant
fields in situations of population aggregation. A partially alternative hypothesis—that field houses also
function to lay claim to limiting resources—is examined using data from the Dolores Archaeological

In response to the growing concern with regional integration and societal complexity, the issue of
ceramic exchange came to the fore in recent archacological research in the northern Southwest. A
plethora of studies argue for the prevalence of ceramic exchange in various areas and time periods. Not
all studies, however, solidly endorse the idea of ceramic importation. That autonomous pottery

PRODUCTION AND BEHAVIORAL MODIFICATION

Post renaissance theories of crime, punishment and rehabilitation led to development of penitentiary
systems in the late 18th and 19th centuries. Conflicting sociological theories resulted in variation in
penitentiary systems. This variation has clear archaeological correlates, which are investigated with
the remains of the United States Penitentiary at Laramie, Wyoming. Investigations of this facility yield
indications of the spatial structure, industrial production, recreation and the context of behavioral

[66] DIVERSITY WITHIN HOMOGENEITY: ALTERNATIVE PERSPECTIVES ON MOUSTERIAN

ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY

The Pontinian Mousterian of west-central Italy is typologically monotonous from the perspective of
traditional (Bordian) systemics, the result of universally low frequencies of denticulate tools. Significant
inter-assemblage variation is present in: 1) techniques for producing flakes from cores, and 2) strategies
for the transport, discard and renewal of retouched tools, Unlike most conventional typological indices,
these technological variables also appear to manifest both dimensional temporal change and links to
patterns of faunal exploitation and cave use. Framing all Mousterian research in terms of traditional
typological units ignores or disguises aspects of technological data directly relevant to contemporary
research issues.

Furthermore, iconographic relationships among Middle Polychrome Greater Nicoya arid Mayoid

Rather, a pattern of iconographic filtration emerges with multiple cultural boundaries marking varying

intensities of elite interaction. This paper focuses on the iconography of Greater Nicoya polychrome

ceramics and explores the implications of iconographic relationships as indicators of inter-regional and

intra-regional elite contact during the Middle Polychrome Period.

Three seasons of excavation at the single component Langford Tradition Robinson Reserve site have
produced a wealth of materials which elucidate the basic technological and subsistence activities of
this Upper Mississippian cultural variant. Data from the analysis of lithic tools (primarily points and
drills), debitage (indicating bipolar manufacture), sherds (representing the entire range of Langford
forms), and a wide range of plants and animal remains (including com, nuts, little barley, deer, and fish)
are used for comparisons with other recently excavated Landford components in the Chicago area to
establish Robinson Reserve's function within a regional settlement pattern.

{62} THE MAYA OF GUATEMALA UNDER SPANISH RULE: REGIONAL VARIATIONS IN THE
NATURE OF COLONIAL EXPERIENCE
Extending MacLeod’s distinction between a Ladino “east” and an Indian “west” in colonial
Guatemala, a resource-rich core and a poorly endowed periphery are defined. The differences between
these zones affected land tenure and settlement, labor, production and exchange, economic institu-
tions, and the conditions of social life. This paper explores the utility of the core-periphery dichotomy
for a better understanding of the social history of Guatemala.

[47] SUBSISTENCE CHANGE AND PINNIPED HUNTING
Oregon coast mammalian faunas spanning the last 3,000 years suggest a shift towards a logistical
strategy of resource procurement. One fauna, however, indicates a shift from terrestrial to marine
mammals. Mortality data and pinniped behavioral data indicate culling of particular age-sex classes,
and imply one pinniped taxa was overhunted via exploitation of newborns of both sexes, thereby
prompting the shift from marine to terrestrial taxa. Survival of the exploited population of the other
pinniped taxon was not impacted at the other site because adult breeding males were the most intensely
exploited age-sex class,

[52] THE LATE WOODLAND TO MISSISSIPPIAN TRANSITION IN THE EASTERN OZARK
REGION, SOUTHEAST MISSOURI
Shell tempered ceramics and arrow points apgeared over a large area of the eastern Ozarks about A.D.
600, burt resulted in negligible changes in the human adaptive strategies. During the Emergent
Mississippi substage there is evidence for the appearance of maize, rectangular wall trench houses, and
possibly flat top mounds. Despite the appearance of these Mississippian cultural elements, castern
Ozark groups maintained a high degree of autonomy. Settlement and subsistence practices continued
to follow strategies which had been wel! establishedor several thousand years. Archaeological evidence
from the Upper Current River drainage indicates the eastern Ozark region was abandoned by indigenous
populations about A.D. 1300.

[22] THE ENTERPRISE OF FLORIDA
The complex of interacting persons, groups and institutions in the Spanish Florida conquest of
1565-1577, the period of the proprietorship of Pedro Menendéz de Aviles and his successors, is described.
The several means of interaction between the native Americans and the intruding Europeans are
examined and an attempt is made to evaluate the degree to which actual contact events matched or
departed from the rhetoric of “peaceful and Christian” conquest. Reasons for the failure of the Spanish
settlement attempts under Menendez and his successors are investigated.

[41] TRANSPORTATION, SEASONALITY AND STORAGE AMONG MID-LATITUDE
HUNTER-GATHERERS
In mid-latitudes, wintering locations are structured by a play-off between transportation costs,
availability of winter resources, and the amount of and accessibility to stored summer/fall resources,
making it inappropriate to explain resource utilization by simple efficiency rankings alone. Examples
from the Great Basin suggest that due to high transportation costs, wintering sites may often be
structured by proximity to comparatively low-ranked winter-available resources rather than to high-
ranked but often insufficient summer/fall-available resources. Variability in this play-off is ultimately |
responsible for the flexibility which characterizes many mid-latitude hunter-gatherer adaptive systems.

[52] ROLE OF MICROARTIFACTS IN DEDUCING LAND USE FROM LOW DENSITY RECORDS
IN PLOWED SURFACES
_ Surface collection is usually the only means of obtaining land use data for large areas. Tilled surfaces
present special interpretive problems because they display only a small fraction of the plowzone artifact
population for examination. Where land use and formation processes combine to produce a low density
record, this sampling element can cause dissimilar records to appear identical when only macroartifacts
(>2mm) are considered. Microartifacts |<2mm) because they have different transport properties and are
typically more abundant offer a solution for such equifinalities, Data from the Middle Woodland of
Southeast Missouri are used to demonstrate the potential of this approach.

[46] URBAN-RURAL RELATIONS IN THE SECOND MILLENNIUM B.C. LEVANT: THE
TEXTUAL EVIDENCE
Although much of the research on early civilizations in the ancient Near East has focused on large
urban centers and neglected small rural sites, such research has had the beneficial result of providing
us with records of urban relations with their hinterland villages. These include census records which
inform us of the range of population and social composition of villages as well as records of taxation
and land transfers. By examining these records at the urban palaces of Alalakh and Ugarit, we can
reconstruct to some degree the amount of control exerted by urban centers over the allocation of land
in surrounding villages and the nature and amount of craft and agricultural products mobilized for the
state from rural villages. Such information is important not only for reconstructing the political
economy of the state but also provides a model which may be useful in interpreting archaeological
material in areas where no texts are available.

[42] IRRIGATED VERSUS NON-IRRIGATED TERRACES IN THE ANDES: EVIDENCE FOR
LATE PREHISTORIC CLIMATIC CHANGE
Both irrigated and non-irrigated terraces are present in the Andes, sometimes in vertical juxtaposi-
tion. In some areas, like the Colca Valley of southern Peru, the non-irrigated terraces, which are
abandoned, are found in zones where dry farming is today impossible. This suggests that a change in
rainfall or temperature regimes over time may be responsible for the abandonment of these terraces.
Recent cultural and environmental evidence for climatic change in the southern Andes is explored over
the past 1,500 years, and the impact it may have had on indigenous agricultural systems.

[81] SABERTOOTH CATS AND THEIR RELEVANCE FOR EARLY HOMINID DIET AND
EVOLUTION
In Plio-Pleistocene Africa three large sabertooth cat species were sympatric with early hominids and
the ancestors of the modern felid community. An understanding of early hominid scavenging must
articulate knowledge of sabertooth paleoecology with actualistic research. Sabertooth functional
morphology and fossil associations suggest: 1) extreme flesh specialization and no bone-crushing
ability, 2) specialization on very large prey, 3) a dense woodland and forest habitat preference. This
suggests the presence of a closed habitat carnivore community dominated by sabertooths and an open
habitat community composed of the modern felid ancestors. Scavenging opportunities were optimal
on these closed habitats, and the sabortooth extinctions at 1.6 million years would have forced hominids
imto a confrontational and risky open habitat scavenging strategy.

{2} TYPOLOGICAL VARIABILITY IN THE EARLY LEVANTINE MOUSTERIAN: ITS NATURE

The Early Levantine Mousterian has been defined traditionally essentially by stratigraphy and
technology. With new data suggesting a very long duration for this industry (less than 120,000 years to
2s late as 45,000}, the stratigraphic definition is ng longer viable. Its characteristic technology is well
defined but little attention has been paid to its iibkice on a regional basis. This paper considers the
range of typological variability present, as it relates to resource variability, basic technology, and
chronology. In addition, the question of Middle Paleolithic versus Upper Paleolithic tool types are
considered in placing this industry within the broader context of the Levantine Middle Paleolithic and
the Mousterian in general. {

MANUFACTURING AT THE LAC LABELLE SITE, MICHIGAN

Relationships between ground stone size and grinding efficiency are implicit in arguments relating
ground stone to levels of agricultural dependence. Data from recent ethnoarchaeologica] investigations
among agropastoralists in Bolivia, who process corn and chenopodium using traditional grinding
equipment, suggests that increasing mano area does reduce grinding time. The reduction in grinding
time is not a simple linear function of increasing mano size, and the form of the relationship is grain
dependent. Models of agricultural intensification which rely on ground stone size are assessed in light
of these findings.

|56] MIDDLE PRECLASSIC REMAINS AT THE SITE OF SANTO DOMINGO, NACO VALLEY,
HONDURAS
; Santo Domingo’s 1979 excavations indicated that a raised area about 40 meters in diameter resulted
from midden accumulation. The deposit was dated to the Middle Preclassic on typological grounds; no
C14 samples or structures were recovered. Reexamination in 1988 confirms the area’s midden origin
and date. A cobblestone platform was found sealed below a collapsed bajareque structure, and itself
covering more midden deposits, This platform is one of the oldest structures found to date in Honduras
and suggests that early Naco Valley occupation was substantial and may have been socially differen-
tiated.

direct evidence of canid scavenging in the form of gnawing marks or chemical erosion resulting from

AMERICANS IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND
Sites containing evidence of protohistoric Native American culture are seldom encountered in

northeastern North America. The Simons site, in Mashpee, Massachusetts, was occupied by a family
of Native American mariners during the eighteenth and ninteenth centuries. Protohistoric ceramics
from the site, similar to low-fired colonial redware, occur with lithic artifacts, shell, faunal remains
and eighteenth century stonewares, delftwares and clay pipes. These materials and their associations
provide evidence of both acculturation and the continuity of Native American traditions into the
historic period as the family adapted to Euro-American lifeways.

[49] GRASS OPAL PHYTOLITH PRODUCTION: A BASIS FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL
INTERPRETATION IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS
Paleoethnobotanical and paleoecological analyses of grass phytoliths from sediments at archaeologi-
cal sites have relied heavily on published correlations of phytolith shapes and grass taxa. A recent study
of native grasses from central North Dakota indicates that while these correlations are gencrally
accurate, significant deviations do occur. Inflorescence material particularly displays different patterns.
Modified correlations of grass taxa and phytolith shapes are proposed that reflect phytolith production
more accurately. Further refinements are expected as additional grasses are examined. Identification
of phytoliths from archaeological sites should be as detailed and accurate as possible to provide sound
data for cultural interpretations.

models for many phenomena sometimes dismissed as “noise” such as oscillations in organizational
states, the relation of organizational complexity to “collapse” of cultural systems, and the role of
unpredictability in adaptation. At the same time, useful application of chaotic theory to anthropology
and archaeology will require mathematical sophistication in order to avoid this approach becoming
merely a source of metaphorical inspiration as has happened with some previous archaeological “fads.”

Discontinuities are evident in the Pacific coastal Guatemalan ceramic sequence at several points in

traditions was truncated around that date, and vigorous new traditions emerged subsequently. Two
types of evidence support this interpretation; 1) stylistic contrasts, and 2) evidence from neutron
activation analysis that suggests discontinuities in resource use. It is argued that ceramic traditions in

PALEOLITHIC
The essential stability of technical processes throughout the Middle Paleolithic periods reflects the
remarkable flexibility of these techniques in coping with a variety of different environmental, economic
and social constraints. Explanation of Middle Paleolithic industrial variants must therefore take
account of these adaptive aspects, as well as distinct regional traditions in technology. Explanations in
terms of activity differences, raw materials, environmental adaptations, technological evolution,
“traditions” etc. are therefore not mutually exclusive, but rather complementary. Despite variability
in these features, the relative stability (or even monotony) or Mousterian variants throughout large
areas of Europe seems to reflect a basic unity in the “ethnic” basis of Mousterian populations.

Recent research, however, has begun to alter this long-held perception. Western and eastem sub-
divisions of the Cehpech ceramic complex have been tentatively defined through detailed comparative
ceramic analysis, and research at Sayil has defined early and late sub-phases. Ceramic data from a
number of Late Classic Maya polities are examined that suggest the Cehpech ceramic sphere was
composed of a number of varied regional complexes.

[21] SMALL STONE PROJECTILE POINTS IN THE FRENCH UPPER PALEOLITHIC
Several North American archaeologists have distinguished functional classes of projectile points
(dart, arrow, and spear points) using attributes such as weight, neck width, and other metrical
dimensions. These North American studies were compared to the results of a laboratory study of small
chipped stone artifacts, all putative projectile points, from the Upper Perigordian and Upper Mag-
dalenian assemblages of southwestern France. Fourteen continuous variables of the tip, edge, and haft
were used in a series of discriminant function analyses; results indicate that edge angle is equally
important in distinguishing classes of Upper Paleolithic projectile points.

OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL CORRELATIONS
Analyses of nonperishable lithic and ceramic artifacts from the Boucher site (VT-FR-26) demonstrate
| the inclusion of diverse burial goods in interments at this cemetery in northwestern Vermont.
Predominantly utilitarian artifacts are included in this Early Woodland period assemblage, dated ca.
600-100 B.C. Intrasite correlation of the different drifact categories revealed distributions more likely |
steributable to episodic burial events than to differential status between interments. Correlation of
these data with other samples from the Northeast further revealed distant relationships with contem-
poraneous Adena and Middlesex manifestations as well as earlier Terminal Archaic and later Middle

[17] SPATIAL ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES AND SITE FORMATION PROCESSES AT THE ABRI
DUFAURE, SOUTHWEST FRANCE
The role of various cultural and natural processes which lead to the formation of the archaeological
record is examined. In order to better understand the complex processes that lead to intrasite
distributions, a number of pattern recognition techniques must be employed. The resolution and
integrity of the Dufaure deposits were examined with respect to material distributions |i.e., lithic
debitage, tools, bone, cobble manuports, burned artifacts, eboulis), orientations, inclinations, lithic
breakage, and lithic refitting. This approach has wide archaeological application, and may be of use to
those who analyze the processes which form intrasite patterns.

[19] LATE ARCHAIC-EARLY WOODLAND IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND: A CASE OF
CULTURAL CONTINUITY

For the last decade evidence has been accumulated that indicates a prehistoric record of cultural
continuity. Even though time changes and the periods proceed, the archaeological record may be
documenting one people adapting to various cultural and environmental conditions. Such adaptational
changes may be most manifested within the technological and economic subsystems towards which
archacology has an obvious bias. On the other hand, data from the social and ideologic subsystems may
support cultural continuity. These theoretical issues are discussed and data are presented supporting
a cultural continuity model.

A hologeistic (cross-cultural) analysis of prehistoric data on three variables, often thought to reflect

evolutionary theory. The close correspondence of population increases with changes in social com-
plexity and artifact type heterogeneity is not supported, However, other patterns of evolutionary growth
appear in these data.

[13] FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF FIRE-ALTERED ROCKS

When analyzed functionally, fire-altered rocks provide useful information on human adaptations and
change. Function in fire-altered rocks can be documented by analysis of the rock's thermal properties
and alteration patterns. Measures of thermal properties such as thermal diffusivity and inertia can be
used to group fire-altered rocks into functional categories. These groupings are testable by observing
physical and chemical alterations (fracture patterns, structural inversions, redox reactions, volatiliza-
tion, etc.) caused by exposure of the rocks to different heating and cooling conditions. Analyses of
fire-altered rocks in two collections from southern California reveal significant functional variability
in both temporal and spatial dimensions.

[49] SOME COMMENTS ON THE ROLE OF PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS IN TROPICAL
PALEOETHNOBOTANY AND PALEOECOLOGY

Phytolith analysis is now of sufficient maturity to provide an independent source of data in tropical
paleoethnobotany and paleoecology. Phytolith specialists are also aware of areas where phytolith
science cannot elucidate important issues and, through on-going studies of tropical plants and
sediments, are discovering new applications. Through a review of our recent studies in the Old World
and New World tropics, we present some contributions, problems, and prospects of phytolith analysis
in informing the archaeological and botanical communities about such issues as; 1) the origins and
dispersals of domesticated plants, 2) the nature of prehistoric modification of tropical forests, and 3)
the distribution and composition of past plant communities.

[3] THE LOWER PALEOLITHIC OF SOUTHEAST ASIA: TOWARD THE DEVELOPMENT OF
BIO-CULTURAL MODELS
j A number of recent articles have suggested that the “amorphous” nature of Pleistocene paleolithic
assemblages ("chopper-chopping tools") in the Far East may result from the minimal cultural
capabilities of Pleistocene hominids, the absende of suitable raw materials or the isolation of this part
_ of the world from other areas of Eurasia. Still other workers have suggested that true Acheulean
. assemblages (with a high percentage of hand-axes) do exist in the Far East and the relatively standardized
| typologies are discernable in the archaeological record. All of these interpretations suffer from serious
shortcomings which cannot explain the totality pf the evidence. An alternative interpretation is
presented based on recent discoveries in China ant Southeast Asia which indicate that the distinct
nature of Far Eastern assemblages is a direct result of the exploitation of forest habitats accomplished
; through a reliance on a largely non-lithic technology that deemphasized the production and utilization
_  Ofhighly standardized lithic typologies. This interpretation is fully consistent with}new paleoenviron-

[28] LATE PRECERAMIC SOCIOPOLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE CASMA VALLEY, PERU
Recent investigations at the Peruvian coastal site of Huaynuna revealed the presence of certain key
elements of complex societal development during the late Cotton Preceramic Period {2,200-1,800 B.C.}.
These elements, which include corporate labor construction, technological! sophistication, and social
status differentiation, formed a partial foundation for subsequent sociopolitical development during
the Initial Period (1,800-900 B,C.) and Early Horizon (900-200 B.C.}. Components at Huaynuna dating
to these later time periods can also be correlated with economic and political systems centered at major
sites located within the Casma Valley.

[6] TORATA ALTA, AN INKA-SPANISH SETTLEMENT

The site of Torata Alta is a small hilltop site with Inka and Spanish ceramics on the surface. Although
the quality of stonework is rough, the architectural layout is well-preserved, the site being laid out in
a grid with streets dividing it into 27 blocks. Much of the site appears to be residential in function,
with possible social or functional differentiation suggested by characteristics of construction and
ceramic frequencies. Limited excavations suggest a pre-1600 construction date and the possible
presence of a church at the site.

[28] ENVIRONMENTAL DYNAMICS AND THE INTERPRETATION OF PATTERNING IN

PRECERAMIC REMAINS FROM SOUTH COASTAL PERU: UPLIFT AND SEA LEVEL

The coast of Peru south of Ilo (17 degrees south latitude} presents well-defined and extensive marine
terraces at 20, 50, and 100 meters above mean sea level with associated preceramic sites, including a
large midden site dated between 5,000 and 10,000 B.P. Interpretation of settlement logistics and
subsistence patterns for these sites depends in part on identifying the dominant processes of rapid
environmental alteration in the area. Although the condition of the terraces intially suggested rapid
uplift, recent geochronic and geomorphic studies indicate slow uplift rates and argue for post-glacial
sea level rise as the dominant process affecting Ca Holocene landscape and preceramic human
occupations.

[52] CONFLICT AND STRESS AT HIWASSEE OLD TOWN DURING THE AMERICAN
REVOLUTION .

During the late eighteenth century traditional Cherokee culture was severely disrupted by open
conflict with Anglo Americans. Ethnohistoric accounts indicate that Hiwassee Old Town, a Cherokee
village in southeastern Tennessee, played a principal role in this border warfare and was destroyed
twice during the 1780's. Recent excavations at the town site have documented a substantial late
eighteenth century Cherokee component. The archaeological manifestations of wartime social and
economic stress at Hiwassee are examined through a comparison of contextual and assemblage
patterning with that evident at nearby mid-cighteenth century Overhill Cherokee sites.

Extensive evidence of later Middle Preclassic populations, some at sites located in the defensible

not just the alluvial flat lands as had been previously thought, but may have controlled territories from

[67] THE TALE THE PINE TREES KNEW: STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS OF EUROPEAN PLANTS
In the stable isotope analysis of paleodiet it is necessary to know the isotopic signatures of the
potential dietary components, As part of a chemical study of the diet and social organization of an Iron
Age community in Central Europe, the isotopic composition of a selection of important domesticated
and wild plant foods was determined. The results are unique for Central Europe, and establish a base
of reference for future isotopic studies, The stable carbon results also indicate a significant separation
of ddmesticated and wild plants (about 1 o/oo); this separation suggests that stable carbon isotope ratios
may be used to test the relative amounts of wild and domesticated plant foods in the prehistoric diet.

[39] THE PROBABILISTIC CALIBRATION OF RADIOCARBON AGES
Imperfect knowledge of the relationship between radiocarbon ages and the calendric time scale has
limited the application of radiocarbon dating to archaeology, particularly when concurrent historical
data were available. Largely through the efforts of the Seattle and Belfast laboratories there has appeared
in recent years a well-replicated, high-precision calibration curve based on dendrochronologically dated
wood. The curve covers the last 9,150 years, with a radiocarbon precision of +15 to +20 years. The use
of this curve is complicated by the many oscillations which cause the calendric age to be a multivalued
function of radiocarbon age. To effectivly use the calibration curve it is necessary to include the effects
of the measurement errors of the radiocarbon date and the calibration curve itself, as well as to deal
with the multivalued character of the curve in a statistically meaningful manner. The primary result
of the calibration, which is implemented on a microcomputer, is a probability distribution on the
calendric time axis that allows derivation of the expectation value associated error, and a variety of
probability ranges (confidence limits).

, Rollefson, G. 14]
size variation may confound multiple sources of inter-assemblage variability. Several approaches to
correcting for sample size differences are explored: 1) inter-assemblage pooling of counts to create large
samples, 2) sub-sampling of assemblages to equalize sample sizes, and 3) simulated derivation of sample
size dependent frequency distributions. These methods are compared in the analysis of seasonal artifact
assemblages from 49 historic Navajo sites on Black Mesa, Arizona.

The problem of interassemblage variability is attacked from a “behavioral” rather than a typological

regional scale, the “Mousterian problem” is interpreted as being the consequence of two basic
strategies: local manufacture or transport of stone artifacts. The heuristical value of this explanation
is demonstrated with data from the European Middle Paleolithic.

Projects such as highways, pipelines, transmission lines, and, more recently, fiber optic cables often

results of regulatory studies for such corridors often amount to little bits of information about a lot of
unconnected pieces. Although such data contribute to regional data bases, they are often unsatisfying
in terms of immediate research results. Case studies are used to illustrate how the limitations of
corridor studies can sometimes be overcome through 1) regional siting studies (that can be GIS assisted),
2) focusing on appropriately scaled research questions, and 3) regulatory flexibility that encourages
trade-offs,

analogy to continental faunal extinctions during the late Pleistocene. New evidence from excavation
of a stratified coastal habitation site on Tahuata, in the Marquesas Islands, allows refinement of this

[24] MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY: A SYNTHESIS OF CURRENT
ARGUMENTS
The classic debate on Mousterian assemblage variability originally focused on two principal factors
that were thought to underlie lithic variability: style and function. Recent studies, however, have
demonstrated that many significant constraints on lithic variability are imposed by aspects of raw
material, technology, and even post-depositional factors. Thus, it is becoming increasingly clear that
no single explanation is sufficient to account for observed variation in the industries, Based on evidence
from the Upper Pleistocene of Western Eurasia, we propose here a new synthesis of the various factors
that appear to work together to produce typological variability as it is currently measured and discuss
implications for the understanding of hominid behavior during this time.

adaptation to a Plains Village life-way. The Shea site indicates that the development of village living
was widespread on the Plains, and it raises taxonomic as well as processual questions about standard
conceptions of Plains villagers.

[63] REINTERRMENT IN THE REAL WORLD: MAKING IT WORK
In January, 1988, the Southern and Eastern Regions of the USDA Forest Service signed a policy for
the treatment of human remains and associated grave goods. The policy, which favors reinterment,
requires each administrative unit of these two regions to form an ad hoc group and write a treatment
action plan. This paper focuses on the development of these action plans, which were completed in
January, 1989, and what the plans mean for managing human remains and associated grave goods on
National Forest Land.

[57] BONE COMPOSITION STUDIES IN ARCHAEOLOGY
Bone composition methods including both stable isotope (13C/12C and 15N/14N) and trace element
(Sr, Zn, Ba, Mn, etc.) studies originated in Geocherfistry. Applying these methods derived from simple
mathematical and chemical models to “messy” biological systems has been more complicated
(although far more interesting) than expected originally. Use of stable isotope ratios of carbon and
nitrogen in bone collagen to indicate dependence on marine foods has led to a reevaluation of our
understanding of human metabolism. Multiple tee analyzing trace element composition in
prehistoric populations indicate that their levels may reveal more about the diagenetic history of the
bone than diet of the person when alive.

[79] CRAFTWORKING AREAS AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF SOCIAL
COMPLEXITY IN A LATE CLASSIC SOUTHEASTERN MESOAMERICAN POLITY
Work at the large Late Classic Center of La Sierra and the region’s smaller contemporaneous sites
reveals that craftworking is almost entirely restricted to La Sierra, where non-local (obsidian, marine
shell) and local (clay, fiber) materials were processed. Other sites show little craftwork, and none used
exotic items. Many finishing products, regardless of material type, have circumscribed distributions.
This contrasts with other southeastern Mesoamerican regions suggesting that manufacturing and

distribution played varying roles in developing and maintaining social complexity. These differing
models will be discussed,

[42) NASCA HABITATION SITES: WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE

One of the great mysteries of the enigmatic Nasca civilization (A.D. 100-600] is the apparent lack of
habitation sites. This is primarily the result of biases in past archaeological research, not a real absence
of habitation sites. A recent systematic survey of the middle and upper Nasca valley has located
numerous Nasca sites, ranging in size from a dozen to several hundred houses. The distribution of
Nasca sites is seen to be dependent on the availability of water resources and arable land, Changes in
settlement patterns during the Early Intermediate Period indicate some important changes in Nasca
society.

This paper reports on the spatial location of mortuary remains, trash mounds, and pithouses at a
prehistoric Hohokam site, and proposes that in addition to such controlling variables as physical
environment, subsistence practices, population increase, and social stratification, the Hohokam’s
mortuary practices played an important role in influencing the directional growth and movement of
their village. The site under investigation is Pinnacle Peak Village, located in Boulder Pass of the
McDowell Mountains of south-central Arizona.

[17] SOIL PHOSPHATE “PRINTS” AND THE DETECTION OF ACTIVITY LOCI AT
PREHISTORIC SITES

Soil phosphate “prints” represent geochemical enrichments of sediments by cultural activities. For
some time researchers have measured both qualitative and quantitative changes in archaeological
sediments to classify ancient activity areas. Since most efforts have been site-specific, the dis-
criminatory power of the method is limited. By applying the method uniformly at functionally and
environmentally distinct sites, the broad utility of the strategy is tested. In a key case, a Mississippian
eastern Woodlands complex and a Plains hunting camp contained strikingly similar contrasting

phosphate “prints” that indexed performance of analogous activities in contrasting settings. A graphic
method is suggested for standardizing presentation and interpretations of results.

‘ [55] THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MIDDLE MISSISSIPPIAN MORTUARY TREATMENTS: A
STATISTICAL AND ISOTOPIC PERSPECTIVE
The social significance of mortuary variation within the prehistoric Middle Mississippian popula-
tions of the southeastern United States can be interpreted using many different referents, For example,
ethnographic accounts have been used as indirect evidence that some mortuary treatments are
correlated with differential access to dietary resources. The conjunctions of morturary variation with
variations in the carbon and stable isotope ratios of prehistoric burials from the Angel Site (a Middle
Mississippian residential and ceremonial center in southwestern Indiana) demonstrate both the
limitations and advantages of ethnographic and statistical ana lyses of prehistoric mortuary treatments.

[43] ESTABLISHING THE TAXON-SPECIFICITY OF CARNIVORE TOOTH MARKS ON BONE
Carnivore tooth marks on Plio-Pleistocene archaeological bone are frequently attributed to hyenas,
because it is assumed they would be the most likely scavengers of hominid bone refuse. This
assumption, however, has not been demonstrated. Hyena gnawed bone collected from naturalistic
| settings documents the frequency and anatomical patterning of tooth marks. As a necessary prereq-
uisite to establishing the taxon-specificity of hyena tooth-marked bone, research in a controlled setting
was conducted to document the characteristic marks produced by different hyena teeth. Methodology,
results and impliciations of our data to interpretations of Plio-Pleistocene archaeological bone as-
semblages are discussed.

Extensive research in the southern Italian region of Calabria has revealed one of the densest areas of
Neolithic settlement known in the Western Mediterranean. The settlements on the Piana di Curinga
belong to the Stentinello culture from the 6th and Sth millennia B.C. and contain well preserved wattle

[11] PRECLASSIC FOUNDATIONS OF CLASSIC MAYA POLITICAL SYSTEMS

Recent research indicates that Classic Maya political systems were the product of a complex,
multilinear process beginning well within the Preclassic era. This process occurred within a broad array
of environmental and cultural regions, centered on the lowland heartland and a far more vast periphery,
Consistent material and symbolic manifestations from the Preclassic archaeological record are ex-
amined as evidences of complex political evolution in both the central lowlands and the southern
periphery, allowing the reconstruction of the interaction networks that generated the growth of polities
upon which the Classic period political order was built.

[66] SARDINIA’S EARLIEST IMMIGRANTS AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE INDIGENOUS

FAUNA

The earliest known human occupation of Sardinia, Corbeddu Cave, consists of cultural levels from
at least 13,590+ 140 B.P. to6,260+180 B.P., containing stone tools, human remains, and a well-preserved
faunal assemblage. The site is important not only in terms of the initial peopling of this Mediterranean
island, but also with respect to the heavy impact hunting inflicted on the indigenous fauna. The
sequence of deposits records the transition from a hunting-gathering subsistence economy to one
involving domestication. This study focuses on taphonomic interpretations of the cervid and canid
remains, as well as examination of pathologies which may be related to environmental stress.

[64] STONE TOOLS AND ECONOMIES: A GREAT LAKES PALEOINDIAN EXAMPLE

In forager societies, “economy” normally is identified with subsistence, In a broader perspective,
however, it concerns the cultural context of production, distribution and use of goods. This perspective
is especially important in eastern Paleoindian studies, where economy often can be approached through
stone tools alone. The economic practices of Paleoindian foragers in the Great Lakes region are
evaluated in this way- In addition, patterns in the production, distribution and use of tools themsel-
ves—the economics of tool use—are compared between successive groups and linked to the broader
cultural systems of which they formed a part.

For too long the Nazca lines have been treated as an astronomical, mathematical, or exotic problem

who painted beautiful polychrome pottery between 1-700 A.D. on the south coast of Peru and who
built the large urban sites in the same region (ca. 1000-1400 A.D.). Until recently, there has been no
direct evidence linking the great ground markings to these cultures. The results of survey in the Ingenio

Based on repeated and complete surface collections made at the Robards Farm (Dunklin County,

on ceramic sherd size variation over space. For both sand and shell tempered ceramics, large sherds
(those significantly bigger than the average in each class) are highly localized. Large sherd sizes and
concentration locations vary between temper types. These iewoe are interpreted as reflecting varied
site formation processes. The dynamic nature of plowzone processes and temporal variability are seen
as especially relevant in explaining the observed patterns at Robards Farm.

included 1) division of labor, sharing, and bi-parental profisioning of the young, and 2) pair bonding
and the ensuing synchronic and diachronic kin bonding. The European data suggest that this transfor-

[57] PREHISTORIC HUMAN DIET AND SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES: THE CONTRIBUTIONS
OF FAUNAL STUDIES
Over the past half century, faunal research has moved from a peripheral and largely descriptive role
to one which is becoming increasingly central to studies of human evolution, After a brief overview of
the development of faunal studies as a coherent discipline, and of recent methodological and theoretical
issues (e.g., taphonomy, utility indices}, this paper considers three specific topics which have been the
focus of much recent faunal research: 1) the problem of quantifying and interpreting faunal assemblages;
2) the role of hunting and scavenging in early hominid adaptations; and 3) the importance of protein,
fat, and carbohydrate as energy sources in forager diet.

[47] TAPHONOMY AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR: PROBLEMS IN DISTINGUISHING CULTURAL

Taphonomists have made significant contributions to the study of prehistoric faunal remains, often
demonstrating that patterning once thought by archaeologists to derive from, and directly reflect, past .
human activities is instead the product of non-human agents. However, while taphonomists have |
clearly recognized the diversity of non-cultural processes affecting faunal assemblages, they often have
viewed human behavior from a normative perspective that may seriously underestimate variability in
faunal assemblages that actually derives from human activities. This paper briefly explores the kinds
of culturally derived patterning in faunal assemblages that may incorrectly be attributed to non-human
agents and suggests areas of research in need of further clarification.

for household use to pottery production for widespread distribution. This study of the Kalinga ceramic
exchange network addresses archaeological issues, documenting the geographical extent of the ex-
change system; the mechanisms of ceramic distribution; and the frequency and types of vessels that
are distributed to settlements of varying distance. The Kalinga exchange network provides a useful
case study for archaeologists interested in developing models of prehistoric ceramic exchange.

[55] OSTEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS ASSIGNED TO THE
SULPHUR SPRINGS STAGE OF THE COCHISE ei Wee (CA. 8,200 - 10,400 B.P.)

Two Early Holocene skeletons recovered from AZ FF10:14, White Water Draw, southeastern Arizona
are assigned to the Sulphur Springs Stage of the Cochise Culture (8,200-10,400 B.P.). Together, these
represent the oldest human remains from the Southwest and are some of the oldest in North America.
One, recovered by Sayles and Antevs, is an adult (25-35 years) female. Both skeletons indicate the
existence of an carly Southwest population which was small inf stature, with individuals exhibiting
dolichocranic crania, winged and shovelled central incisors, shovelled lateral incisors, small molars,
and platymeric femora.

146] SEGMENTARY STATE AND ORGANIZATIONAL VARIATION IN EARLY COMPLEX
SOCIETIES: A RURAL PERSPECTIVE

The distinction suggested by ethnographers between “segmentary” and “unitary” states helps to
clarify the range of variation in the political and economic organization of ancient complex societies.
in these systems, the degree of economic specialization in village production can measure regional
integration between centers and hinterlands. Faunal and other economic data from the mid-third
millennium B.C, village of Gritille in southeast Turkey suggests a low level of economic integration
apparently characteristic of segmentary states. Rural organization in these relatively primitive polities
differs markedly from that of more complex, unitary states such as nearby Ebla in third millennium
North Syria.

[7] WHAT MAKES A SHELL MIDDEN?

Although shell middens are considered a “type of site,” distinct from “lithic scatters,” “kill sites,”
and “habitation sites,” the only attribute that all shell middens have in common is the presence of
shell. Portions of shell middens could be lithic scatters, kill sites, or habitation sites. Therefore, to
discuss shell middens in a global sense, one has to focus on the only attribute that all shell middens
share—the shell. Interpretations of shell involve its species, season of death, preferred habitat during
life, mode of death, deposition, and post-depositional alterations. These are taphonomic characteristics,
involving the passage of organisms with shell from the biosphere to the lithosphere. Thus, the only
unifying aspect of all research on shell middens is the taphonomy of the shell.

[76] A REEVALUATION OF WILLIAM H. SEAR’S EXCAVATIONS AT THE ETOWAH MOUNDS,
1953

In 1953, William H. Sears excavated an extensive series of test units in the village area of the Etowah
site. These were designed to determine the stratigraphy of the site as well as gather information on
ceramic sequences, house structures and other cultural variables. These data have, to date, received
little attention by archaeologists working in the Southeast. This paper is a reexamination of Sears’ data
in an effort to discern aspects of the cultural occupation of the Etowah village area. Questions of ceramic
distributions are addressed as are aspects of the use of various locations in the village area of the site
through time.

MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION
The Early Woodland period is characterized by a decline relative to the preceding Terminal Archaic
in the volume, but not the geographical extent, of chipped stone artifacts made from materials that
occur within the region and which circulated through both broad-based and focused types of exchange
networks. In contrast, the incidence of artifacts made from materials originating outside of the region
slowly increased through the Early Woodland period in comparison with the levels documented for the
Terminal Archaic period. The implications that these changes have for traditional views of these

[47] MORTALITY PATTERNS AS INDICATORS OF UPPER PLEISTOCENE HUMAN
PREDATOR NICHE: A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE
‘  Acomparative perspective on the prey selection habits of predators and other causes of death in prey
populations is needed to interpret archaeological mortality patterns. This paper examines the range of
variation in prey age selection among modern predators relative to other natural mortality phenomena
and defines a prey age variable that is useful for distinguishing modern predator niches. Some prehistoric
human-generated mortality patterns from Upper Pleistocene Italy and Holocene North America are
then compared within this framework. In all cases, humans/hominids behaved as ambush predators
or scavengers. Significant temporal variation in habitual prey selection and, by implication, the relative
emphasis of access methods corresponds to climatic deterioration of the last glacial but may predate
the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition as defined from tool industries.

The results indicate that all 40 were used in a seasonally specific task, possibly the processing of tree

important implications for patterns of land use.

___ [11] THOUGHTS ON TERRITORIAL ORGANIZATION WITHIN CLASSIC MAYA STATES
Hieroglyphic inscriptions from the western Maya lowlands often mention a class or office of nobles
who ruled smal! satellite sites within large polities. The apparent rise of these ruling subsidiaries in
the Late Classic period (A.D. 650-800) may have helped to define the territorial domains of the large
western polities centered on Palenque, Yaxchilan, Piedras Negras, and other sites. This phenomenon
seems to have been restricted to the western lowlands and perhaps areas of present-day Campeche, and
might suggest some degree of variation in the internal organization of ancient Maya states.

[73] DOMESTIC PRODUCTION OF SMALL COPPER ARTIFACTS DURING THE MILAGRO
CULTURE OCCUPATION AT PENON DEL RIO (GUAYAS BASIN)
Small copper artifacts from domestic contexts of the Milagro Culture occupation at Penon del Rio
indicate that some metallurgical production occurred at the household level. While the sample
recovered includes a high variability of end-products, many of these appear to have been fabricated
from two essential “blanks,” classified here as square wire and strips. An integrated production system
is proposed which is argued to have allowed more artisans to practice metallurgy by obtaining these
preforms through trade. The importance of a general model which reconstructs the metal-working
process is emphasized for purposes of identifying archaeological contexts where this activity took place.

[64] 1 WOULD RATHER BE HERE THAN OUT ON THE TUNDRA
Over the past 60 years two dominant and competing models of early Paleoindian economy in the
Midwestern United States have emerged—specialized hunting and generalized foraging. Both models
are predicated upon assumptions about optimal foraging behavior, the antiquity of humans in the
Midwest, paleoecological reconstructions, the behavior of large gregarious herbivores in complex
environmental settings, and the temporal placement of their extinction. These assumptions are
evaluated by identifying patterns in lithic exploitation and human settlement. This evaluation
demonstrates that the early Paleoindian economy of the Midwest was specialized hunting, but in
conjunction with foraging activities,

During intervals of climatic amelioration from 33,000 to 10,000 B.P. in the Aquitaine Basin of
southwestern France, red deer was the main prey of the late Pleistocene hunter. Determination of |
season of death through cementum annuli analysis and construction of age profiles of the red deer were
combined with existing data from reindeer and fish exploitation from seven early and final Upper
Paleolithic sites. The results suggest clear differences in the hunting strategies employed during the
two periods, These contrasting strategies imply change in the social organization of the hunters as well
as an adaptive response to the changing conditions of the terminal Pleistocene environment.

Facing apparent failure tocreate anomothetic science, archaeologists remain committed toa research
program rife with inconsistencies. Relying on explanatory models borrowed from othern sciences is
inconsistent with building archacological theory. Nevertheless, it is ironic that discussions of historical
sciences, particularly the concepts that enable them to effectively explain change, have been poorly
received. Yet, by examining the theoretical underpinnings and methodological implications of histori-
cal sciences, archaeologists can begin to unravel many inconsistencies impeding the realization of their
goals. What emerges however, is not a set of answers to our questions, but an entirely new set of

}47| SEASONALITY STUDIES AND PALEOINDIAN SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES
The growing body of data on eruption, wear, and crown height of bison lower dentitions from
Paleoindian bonebeds provides a substantial basis for the examination of seasonal trends in the use of
large game animals by late Pleistocene/early Holocene humén groups in western North America. While
; there is a definite pattern of winter mortality, other lines of evidence indicate minimal processing of
the carcasses. Procurement of food resources for storage does not seem to have been a primary concern.
This suggests that mass kill-butchery sites may have played a different role in Paleoindian systems
than in those of later bison-hunting groups where mass kills were a key component of oveg-wintering
strategies.

Agricultural terracing develops in four phases: initial terrace formation, expansion, discontinuance,

construction of irrigation works by household groups, intervillage cooperation, development of terrace
tools from hard wood to iron, institution of regulatory measures on water rights and distribution,
clustering of terraces gradually undertaken by the descending generations, and the eventual demise of
rice swiddening. Terrace construction discontinues as available water sources are exhausted, Per-
manent abandonment is caused by erosion lowering the creek floor thereby obstructing the channel to
the irrigation canal.

jel] A GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL REEVALUATION OF EARLY COCHISE CULTURE ARTIFACT
ASSOCIATIONS WITH PLEISTOCENE LAKE COCHISE, ARIZONA
Geoarchacological investigations of the lacustrine stratigraphy and geochronology of Pluvial Lake
Cuchise in southeastern Arizona, show that high stands occurred from 13,750 to 18,400 B.P., once
Seems the early Holocene around 8,900 B-P., and twice during the middle Holocene. Ground stone
eecitacts of the Sulphur Spring stage of the Cochise Culture, previously reported to be temporally
eemoctated with the last Pleistocene high stand of Lake Cochise, are shown to have come from Late
Ficliocene mon-lacustrine colluvial sediments. These findings fail to confirm the view that the Sulphur
Gece Sage was contemporaneous with the Clovis complex. Instead, the Sulphur Spring stage
eepresents the oldest Archaic occupation in the American Southwest, radiocarbon dated between

[46] POLITICAL CENTRALIZATION AND THE REORGANIZATION OF RURAL PRODUCTION
The relationship between political centralization and increasing specialization of the economy is
examined through a study of household economic reorganization at the site of Kurban Hoyuk, on the
Turkish Euphrates. During the third millennium B.C. Kurban grew from a small village-sized site to a
more diversified small town, coincident with regional political centralization. Third millennium B.C.
residential structures were excavated to determine the degree of economic specialization ata hinterland
site of an early state system. Results of the artifact analyses reveal increasing economic specialization
on the non-elite household level as the state society developed. The findings are used to evaluate
explanations for increasing specialization of the economy in early state societies.

Archaeological survey and testing, carried out with the Anguilla Archaeological and Historical
Society in January 1986, identified 12 well-preserved petroglyphs in Chamber 1, the front part of
Fountain Cavern. Two radiocarbon dates (on shell) and analysis of excavated ceramics (29 vessels
identified) indicated major use occurred after A.D. 500, during the post-Saladoid era. Attribution of
Fountain Cavern to the post-Saladoid is in accord with evidence from open sites that indicate major
occupation occurred later on Auguilla than on volcanic islands in the northern Lesser Antilles. Fountain
Cavern is interpreted as a ceremonial site used primarily during the post-Saladoid period.

Franciscan missionaries made remarkable progress in planting mission communities in southeastern

rapid missionary expansion largely from the perspective of the missionaries themselves, crediting them
with improving the lot of benighted natives and imagining the mission as an example of “Spain’s
frontiering genius.” In the last few decades, historians and anthropologists have challenged that classic
construction, They have taken a more balanced view, seeing natives as determining the outcome of
Franciscan initiatives and the missions themselves as failures in many repsects.

The limited archaeobotanical record presently available for South Asia between 2,000 and 4,000 B.C.,
displays a tremendous amount of temporal and spatial variability. This variability has been attributed
to the evolution of region-wide subsistence systems, influence from areas outside South Asia, differing
plant-use strategies amongst local populations, and bias in sampling or methods of analysis. South
Asian archacobotanical variability is evaluated in the light of new data, and further suggestions for its

EUROPE

Prevailing theories on the emergence of social stratification in Bronze Age Europe (e.g., craft
specialization/wealth, subsistence/redistribution, social storage and entrepreneurial models}, it is
argued, are deficient in defining the conditions under which differential control of resources (subsis-
tence, labor, technology) was initially established by an emergent elite. An alternate “elite-majority”
model is offered which generates stratification from the structured patron-client relationships resulting

from residential shifts within a circumscribed, high risk environmental setting. Implications of the
model are discussed with reference to Mediterranean and Temperate European archaeological records.

Processes that contribute to the formation of the archaeological record must be deduced from physical

for interpretation. This method includes locational anlaysis but also extends to documentation of the
focmal properties of objects and deposits containing them. It is demonstrated that the growth of
knowledge regarding the evolution of an archaeological deposit is inhibited by: 1) failure to create units
that facilitate the systematization of archaeological phepomena, 2) reification of analytic units in
behevioral terms, and 3) lack of an archaeologically sale body of spatial-analytic theory.

Macro-regional uniformity of Meadowood Blades across southern Ontario is certainly evident,

The reasons for these differences may be strictly technological, or they may be intended in a
symbolic-informational sense for other members of the society. Indeed, they may simply represent
subtle expressions of micro-regional ethnicity. Subsequent widespread distribution of Ohio Flint Ridge

constructing it. Social meanings of objects are highlighted when they are involved in cross-cultural
trade. This paper contrasts the uses of Mediterranean imports at early Iron Age Heuneberg and at
Durrnberg bei Hallein. At the former, evidence suggests a wholesale, direct adoption of Mediterranean

Princeton, New Jersey, to locate the remains of a four and one-half acre eighteenth century omamental
garden and its associated working farm. Its imgrint on the land will define the framework for
reconstruction and restoration. This paper focuses on a pragmatic approach to the excavation of large

| areas with fine-grained soil stratigraphy and complex features to recover information about the garden.
This in turn is integrated with archaeobotanical data and household data to produce both an ar-
chacological description and an ethnographic context for the garden.

[36] SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION IN MISSISSIPPIAN AND FORT ANCIENT SOCIETIES

Evidence for social differentiation is examined in examples of Cahokia Mississippign and Ohio Fort
Ancient households from several types of domestic sites. Patterns of settlement organization,
household size, storage facilities, and artifact assemblages are compared and contrasted. Factors other
than social differentiation that may account for the variability in these attributes are considered, and
the value of each attribute as an index of social differentiation is weighed.

[72] ARABIAN-AFRICAN CONTACTS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN RED SEA

Analysis of obsidian from archaeological sites on both sides of the southern Red Sea has revealed
approximately 60 definable obsidian sources, Utilizing standard chemical and trace element techni-
ques, this study indicates that exchange and other forms of contact across the Red Sea began around
5,000 B.C. In addition to this network of obsidian exchange, there is some suggestion that this trade
pattern is part of a larger interaction sphere, involving East Africa, southern Arabia and India, that
accomodated flows of various exotica including flint, resins, and semi-precious stones.

[52] DIET BREADTH AND THE ADOPTION OF HORTICULTURE IN THE EASTERN UNITED

STATES

An Inverse correlation between walnuts and indigenous cultigens during the Woodland period is

examined using the diet breadth model. The model predicts that greater abundance of resources with

high caloric returns may result in the exclusion of lower return resources from diet breadth. Walnuts
provide lower caloric returns than cultigens like sunflower, sumpweed, and goosefoot. Lower repre-
sentation of walnuts coincident with increased cultigens in the archaeological record is consistent with
the hypothesis that greater reliance on horticulture resulted in the exclusion of walnuts from Woodland
diets. The hypothesis is tested against the archaeological records of four regions in the Southeast.

[28] SUBSISTENCE CHANGES IN COASTAL PERU DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD
MILLENNIA B.C.

The Cotton Preceramic period in coastal Peru has long been described in terms of a maritime
subsistence economy. Based on recent archaeological, ecological, and geomorphological fieldwork
conducted in the Supe Valley of Peru, this paper introduces a series of models which use the formal
logic of integer programs. The models are implemented for several scenarios to investigate the
subsistence behavior of the populations inhabiting the Supe Valley during different phases of the
Preceramic and Initial periods, The importance and feasibility of marine versus terrestrial diet in the
Supe Valley is evaluated. The results produced by the models lead to a reinterpretation of the
subsistence behavior of coastal societies and provide a new sequence of economic changes during the
Preceramic and Initial periods. The paper also demonstrates how integer programming allows for
greater generality in analyzing resource use than the existing methods.

[59] ANIMAL UTILIZATION AT UMM QSEIR

Recent findings from northern Mesopotamia indicate that the fifth millennium subsistence
economies display greater flexibility than traditionally expected. Halaf pioneers at Umm Qseir took
advantage of “game park conditions” of the Middle Khabur, exploiting steppic gazelle and onager as
well as riverine game while using prolific domestic pigs as insurance against the eventuality of poor
hunting. Caprids were exploited for secondary products and for meat. The persistence of wild game in
the late Uruk indicates that opportunities for hunting continued into the fourth millennium, but the
focus on larger steppic game and the abandonment of swine herding point to a basic change from the

Halaf in the nature of the late Uruk occupation,

[73] TOWARDS A REGIONAL CHRONOLOGY FOR NORTHERN MANABI PROVINCE,

ECUADOR: CHRONO-STRATIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE FROM THE JAMA RIVER DRAINAGE

‘ Although well-known as the territory of Ecuador’s Jama-Coaque Culture, a complex prehispanic

chiefdom spanning some 2,000 years, northern Manabi Province is perhaps the least studied sector of

coastal Ecuador, having a very poorly documented cultural chronology. Recent archaeological research

centered in the Jama River drainage addresses this problem. Radiometric assays, tephro-chronological

evidence, and ceramic data are marshalled from stratified sites in the middle and lower reaches of the

drainage as a means of documenting a valley-wide sequence of cultural occupation, with special

emphasis given to the large ceremonial center of San Isidro.

[80] THE MEDIEVAL PIETA: SCULPTURE OR FETISH?

The meaning of northern Pietas, the most popular later medieval religious theme, are redefined as
objects of material culture, Returning to 16th century Iconoclastic writings and analyzing production
history as well as material characteristics, I suggest that in the medieval context Pietas were used as
fetishes or idols, not as displays of luxury or as precious works of art. Pietas encouraged an intensely
private and literally empathic viewer response (because of its physical and tactile nature) to Christ and
Mary—Pietas therefore were personally useful objects that may be employed as crucial social indices
of religious attitudes and practices among ordinary people.

[29] THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR CERAMICS OF FORMAL PRODUCTION
AND DISTRIBUTION MODELS
Formal economic models demonstrate the relationship among the quantities of available inputs—
labor, clay, wood—and the quantity of ceramic output. Distribution models predict who are the
consumers, Fixed and variable inputs in the short and long term are examined in order to create long-run
production functions. For household ceramic producers diseconomies rapidly outweigh economies of
scale resulting in the transition to specialized ceramic shops. Analagously, the inelasticity of household
demand is mathematically shown to result through distribution models in the development of ceramic
traders. Ethnoarchaeological evidence is used to estimate the actual parameters of the models.

[78] THE PILLARS OF CUZCO: THE CALENDRICAL AND ASTRONOMICAL SIGNIFICANCE
The most important device in Incaic astronomy, used for calibrating the calendar, was a set of four
pillars on the horizon of Cuzco, by which sunset was observed. Earlier, I argued that sunset between
the central pillars occurred on 2 September and helped define the synodic and sideral lunar month
around the following equinox. Here, I analyze the calendrical and ritual significance of the date, 10
April, when the sun set there again. This date has no apparent luner associations. I also present data
that could be used to discover the original placement of the ushnu from which the pillars were observed.

DIFFERENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS OF DESIGN ELEMENTS OF LATE CLASSIC PAINTED AND
INCISED POTTERY FROM THE NACO VALLEY, NORTHWESTERN HONDURAS

Design elements were studied on three classes of Late Classic Pottery: Conejo Bichrome, Conejo (red
on orange) and Mono (black on orange} varieties; Chamelecon Polychrome (three varieties), a red and
black on orange ware with affinities to Gualpopa Polychrome; and several types within the Masica
system of incised and red-painted vessels. Individua] elements and combinations of elements were
unevenly distributed within the region, and within the major center of La Sierra. These differences may
mark regional social groups, or status differences with certain designs resricted to the La Sierra elite.
To date, distributions of other artifact categories support the second hypothesis.

REMOTE SENSING OF GLAZE PERIOD TOWNS IN THE GALISTEO BASIN, NORTHERN NEW
MEXICO

Two Finds of infrared data were flown in late summer of 1987 by the Stennis Space Center of NASA
in flight lines that intersected archaeological ruins of the Galisteo Basin, northern New Mexico.
Simultaneous collection of both Thermal Infrared images and Color Infrared Photography (CIR) were
made over four large prehistoric towns including: San Marcos, San Lazaro, Colorado and San Cristobal
Pueblos. The flight lines recorded both the interior layout of the central place towns as well as
information on surrounding villages and farm fields. Elements of the town-size settlements are clearly
revealed including: room blocks, plazas, gates, shrines and reservoirs. Using the remote sensing data,
maps were prepared for field checking carried out during the summer of 1988. The transect coverage
allows analysis of settlement networking and the dynamics of Glaze Period communities, Moreover,
in the computer enhancements of the digital sensor data, ruins show differential thermal emissivity.
The CIR photography also is useful in constructing base maps, stereo-viewing of relief and identifying
pebble mulched fields.

THE GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF PLACE: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE TUCSON BASIN, ARIZONA

Prehistoric landscapes are key elements in settlement pattern analysis. From A.D, 800-1450,
Hohokam settlement along the San Xavier reach of the Santa Cruz River in the Tucson Basin is a
function of distance from the floodplain, Diachronic variation in settlement pattern during this period,
however, is partially a function of nearness to previous settlements, and partially a function of
adjustment to changing landscape elements on the floodplain (¢.g., channel entrenchment and filling,
and sand dune, cienega and arroyo fan formation). The geoarchacology of place, therefore, has the

. potential to help differentiate berween possible cultural and geomorphic determinants of settlement.

INTEGRATION AND STRUCTURE OF A NONRIVERINE HOHOKAM CLASSIC PERIOD
COMMUNITY

In the northern Tucson Basin of southern Arizona, two earlier settlement clusters coalesced in the
early Classic Period to form a single multi-site community covering 146 square kilometers. A platform
mound site was centrally located within this integrated complex spanning basin floor to mountain
flanks. Regional survey, mapping and excavation at both community and site levels have produced
quantified distributions for horizontal and vertical differentiation. Levels of productive specialization
and some consumptive patterns have been demonstrated that are commensurate with a strong network
of exchange.

Taphonomic characteristics of two Pueblo II mass burials at Yellow Jacket sites SMT1 and 5SMT3
are similar to those of other Anasazi mass burials for which cannibalism has been postulated. Evidence
of human modification of the bone assemblages includes cutting, perimortem bone breakage, burning,
and possible tool manufacture. Although the two sites are only 300 meters apart, treatment of the
material differs considerably from one site to the other. Breakage of the 5MT3 material |eight
individuals) is nearly total and is far more extensive than that of the SMT1 material (four individuals).

from the perspective of a contemporary potting compound in Teotihuacan, Mexico. The frequency
percent and weight percent of ceramic debris distributed around a kiln are compared statistically with
the recorded output of Vessel Form Classes fired in the kiln, to evaluate the correspondence between

WHY NOT USE A GRADIOMETER?: ON THE USE OF MAGNETIC SURVEY DATA OBTAINED
AT TWO SENSOR HEIGHTS
Magnetic surveys are sometimes conducted using a gradiometer consisting of a vertical pair of
magnetometer sensors. This configuration eliminates diurnal changes and long range trends. If the data
from the two sensors are separately used, additional information is available. Possibly significant
longer-range patterning can be seen and estimates of anomaly source depth can be made. In fact, the
gradiometer results can be approximated by filtering single-sensor data. These points will be discussed
and comparisons made with excavation results using two sets of magnetic and excavated data from a
