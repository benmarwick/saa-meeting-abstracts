, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(1) PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE INTERDISCIPLINARY INVESTIGATIONS IN THE AYACUCHO
VALLEY IN HIGHLAND PERU. This symposium is intended to present the preliminary results of
the interdisciplinary investigations conducted from 1969 through 1972 in the Ayacucho Valley, in
highland Peru. Two of the research goals were to investigate the beginnings of the domestication
of plants and animals and the emergence of sedentism in the Ayacucho Valley, Peru. Coprolite
analysis and faunal analysis as presented here relate to the domestication problem. A method for
detecting prehistoric use of maize is discussed. Seasonally specific sites are also discussed. In
addition, information on paleoclimatology, functional analysis, and lithic technology is reported
here. A summary of the cultural implications of the Peruvian preceramic is also included.
(2) EXPERIMENTAL DATA SETS AND HUMAN BEHAVIOR: PREDICTIVE AND ANALYTICAL DI-
RECTIONS. Archaeological experimentation has dealt primarily with the duplication of human
behavior. Without explicit theoretical foundation and methodological controls, however, experi-
mental results will not necessarily provide relevant information for more general anthropological
questions. By making explicit the theoretical framework of an experiment, its associated
assumptions can be strengthened by experimental and other empirical justification. This sym-
posium will discuss the design and initial results of archaeological experiments aimed at con-
trolling variables affecting human behavior and generating archaeologically testable data sets.
' Experimental contexts include computer simulation, laboratory and field experiments, and
analytic methods.
(3) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE LOWER COLUMBIA RIVER REGION. The archaeology of the
Lower Columbia River region is approaching the end of one phase and the beginning of another.
; The basic culture history and chronology have been largely worked out, and the time is ripe fora
review and synthesis of past and current work and an effort at charting and organizing directions
and goals for future, problem-oriented research. The aim of this symposium is to present such a
review and provide a forum for those involved in the archaeology of this region to exchange ideas
and information on the questions and problems to be approached in the coming years.
(4) RESEARCH DESIGN IN CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. Cultural resource manage-
ment is entirely the result of legislation over the past several years. The program has been good
for the preservation of archaeological values; however, the research objectives of American ar-
chaeology got left behind as historic preservation surged ahead. Research is crucial to ar-
chaeology; otherwise there is no point to the discipline. But the proponent of cultural resource
management, the federal government, is not a research organization. Herein lies the problem of
research in contract work. Research goals must be sensitive to the needs of land developers,
federal land managers, and archaeologists.
(5) PREHISTORIC CRAFT PRODUCTION (SESSION 1). The symposium theme is the use of ar-
chaeological data in the analysis of modes of production. The specific focus will be the interrela-
tionship between social organization and nonagricultural production. Papers deal with the follow-
ing topics: (1) recognition of specific forms of organization of production (e.g., craft versus
domestic) using archaeological data, (2) the interpretation of the relationship between prehistoric
social organization and production, and (3) the development of general models for the analysis of
prehistoric modes of production. Because of the nature of the archaeological record, most of the
papers will examine ceramic production, although some papers concern other goods.
(6) RADAR IN ARCHAEOLOGY. The growing pressure to conduct archaeological survey investiga-
tion with both speed and efficiency in response to increasing federal and state legislation has
created a demand for more sophisticated archaeological technology. The recent testing of sub-
surface radar, in both prehistoric and historic settings, shows definite promise in this connec-
tion.
(9) ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS IN
PREHISPANIC MESOAMERICA. This symposium examines cultural adaptation as expressed by
changing patterns of Mesoamerican settlement systems. The papers, drawn from all major
cultural regions of Mesoamerica, present data derived from recent field research. Although all the
papers share a basic concern with settlement system analysis, they focus on two basic
analytical approaches: (1) the analysis of the role of the natural environment and the application
of spatial models and (2) the explanation of population distribution in time and space.
(10) ARCHAEOLOGY IN NORTHERN BELIZE: THE CUELLO PROJECT. Northern Belize has
recently been the focus of several important research projects in Maya archaeology, among them
19
, the British Museum-Cambridge University Corozal Project, the British Columbia-Minnesota Rio
Hondo Project, and the S.M.U. Cerros Project. This session deals with a fourth such project, in-
vestigating the Formative site of Cuello, and presents results from the 1978-1979 excavations in
a regional perspective.

(11) RECOVERY FROM THE ILOPANGO VOLCANIC ERUPTION, EL SALVADOR. llopango
Volcano in central E| Salvador erupted explosively during the third century A.D. and caused a ma-
jor natural disaster within a 100-km radius. Field and laboratory research of the Protoclassic Pro-
ject in 1978 was directed toward understanding specific recovery processes. These include soil
recovery, vegetative recolonization, and human reoccupation (demographic recovery as well as
recovery of indigenous ceramic and lithic industries). Partial soil and vegetative recovery two cen-
turies after the eruption allowed for significant human recolonization from the north during the
sixth century A.D.

(13) DEATH AND SOCIETY: MORTUARY SITE DATA AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION. In the more
than ten years since the symposium published as Social! Dimensions of Mortuary Practices, a
number of archaeologists have investigated social organization by analysis of mortuary site data.
The aim of the present symposium is to examine some of the varied directions that studies in
mortuary behavior are currently taking. A collection of data sets is analyzed by a variety of quan-
titative and methodological techniques to show some of the potential insights into social
organization that can be derived from mortuary data.
(14) PREHISTORIC CRAFT PRODUCTION (SESSION II). The symposium theme is the use of ar-
chaeological data in the analysis of modes of production. The specific focus will be the interrela-
tionship between social organization and nonagricultural production, Papers deal with the follow-
ing topics; (1) recognition of specific forms of organization of production (e.g., craft versus
domestic) using archaeological data, (2) the interpretation of the relationship between prehistoric
social organization and production, and (3) the development of general models for the analysis of
prehistoric modes of production. Because of the nature of the archaeological record, most of the
papers will examine ceramic production, although some papers concern other goods.
(15) KOSTER: THE EARLY AND MIDDLE ARCHAIC HORIZONS. Since 1969 excavations at the
Koster site in the lower Illinois River Valley have produced a series of 21 well-preserved Archaic
components, As part of an ongoing program of interdisciplinary research, interest has focused
upon 16 Middle Archaic components, and preliminary studies have been made of Horizon 11, an
Early Archaic component. The purpose of the present symposium is to summarize the results of
specific analyses as well as the results of our attempts to integrate these various sources of data
into an interpretive framework for examining the causes of subsistence-settlement change in the
Middle Archaic.
(16) NATURAL AND CULTURAL PROCESSES IN THE FORMATION OF AN ARCHAIC SHELL MID-
DEN ON THE GREEN RIVER, KENTUCKY. The Green River shell middens, long important to inter-
pretations of eastern U.S. prehistory, have yielded cucurbits dating to 2500 B.C. in an otherwise
“forest efficiency” subsistence milieu. Two factors—an apparent lack of clear and consistent
horizontal stratification within the middens and a need for a better understanding of the relation-
ship of the middens to the river's floodplain—have combined to dictate a research design in-
tegrating geological, paeoecological, and archaeological perspectives in order to understand
the processes responsible for shell midden formation. Papers reporting the methodology and
results of microstratigraphic, paleoethnobotanical, and geological analyses are followed by an
interpretative summary.
(17) ECOLOGICAL MODELS IN ECONOMIC PREHISTORY. Ecological and economic systems
share a number of similarities in such areas as resource limitation and responses to resource
scarcity, diversity of interactions, spatial characteristics, and structural components. These
similarities give both kinds of systems a similar degree of complexity, facilitating the inter-
change of research tools and theoretical models, This symposium focuses on the common prin-
ciples underlying both fields and attempts to evaluate their utility in archaeological research.
Although ecological and economic theory are not isomorphic, at a general level of description it
is felt that the use of a common framework can lead to development of a more powerful theory of
cultural evolution.
(18) SESSION SPONSORED BY THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL INSTITUTE OF AMERICA. OLD WORLD
ARCHAEOLOGY FOR NEW WORLD ARCHAEOLOGISTS.
(19) HISTORY OF ARCHAEOLOGY. The history of archaeology is restricted to a few books and a
handful of articles, consisting mainly of narrative accounts or chronicles of what took place, with
20
, periodification as the major interpretative device. These works are useful and necessary but hard-
ly exhaust the possibility for study. Issues that remain unexamined include “social and political
organization” of the discipline; reasons for the timing of innovative developments; relations with
other disciplines; relations with living survivors of the archaeological cultures. As a means of
stimulating interest in an analytic approach to our discipline, the symposium presents re-
Searches on a variety of topics and hopes to generate discussion and debate.
(20) SIMULATION IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Simulations can aid researchers in exploring the dynamics
of multivariate methods of demographic or sociocultural stability and change, decision making,
formation of the archaeological record, and other processes. They also provide the means for
evaluating the effects of varying selected parameters of models, and they facilitate the revision
of models so that their predictions more nearly agree with archaeological observations. The sym-
posium papers provide a sampling of current work in archaeological simulation. Because ex-
planation of the models and simulation results does not ordinarily lend itself well to linear, oral
presentation, the symposium will take the form of a poster session and scheduled discussion
period.
(21) SESSION SPONSORED BY THE AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR CONSERVATION AR.
CHAEOLOGY. ETHICS OF CONTRACTING. Contracting has been an aspect of American Ar-
chaeology for many, many years. In recent years the profession has been faced with every mount-
ing pressure and problem that now require a serious |ook at “Ethics of Contracting,’ Some of the
: major concerns before archaeologists today are the quality of research and reporting, the profes-
sional responsibility to the resource and the profession, responsible scheduling, territoriality,
resource orientation vs. client orientation, and pricing, including the ethics of using volunteer or
tuition-paid labor in a contract situation.
’
(24) COAST TO COAST: COMPARATIVE MARITIME ADAPTATIONS. Maritime hunter-gatherers
form a select subset of hunter-gatherers exploiting abundant and diverse coastal resources and
characterized by locally dense populations and complex, semisedentary settlement patterns.
With a few exceptions in Africa and Europe, maritime lifeways extend back only to Upper
Paleolithic times and have nearly equal antiquity in both Old and New Worlds. With eustatic
stabilization of the coastline ca. 3000-6000 B.P., coastal sites became abundant in many parts of
North America. Many of these sites exhibit excellent preservation of faunal remains, which may
be used for paleoecological reconstruction. The members of this symposium address themselves
to three common themes, applying them to archaeological sites on the Atlantic and Pacific
coasts of North America: the origins of maritime adaptations; the effects of environmental
change on coastal societies; and the nature of prehistoric coastal subsistence and settlement
patterns.
(25) DIRECTIONS IN FAUNAL ANALYSIS AND ZOOARCHAEOLOGY. The stimulus for this sym-
posium has been a growing sense of unease regarding attempts by many investigators to utilize
faunal materials for a vast number of highly detailed and speculative studies in archaeology.
Discussion will center on what it is we believe we are doing, how well we think we can do it, and
where our research efforts should be guided in the near future. Such reflection may well be of
considerable value at this time. Concentration will be upon major concepts and problems of wide
concern within zooarchaeology. Specific topics to be dealt with include domestication,
paleoecology and paleoenvironments, aging techniques, and basic problems in quantification.
(26) MAYAN ETHNO-ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNO-HISTORY. Results of two seasons of ethnoar-
chaeological work in the Chiapas Highland, together with related Mayan Colonial site investiga-
tions, provide the basis for new archaeological interpretations and orientations. Material cor-
relates of economic specialization and rank, of interaction intensity, and of ritual behavior are
presented, Variation in house structure characteristics is related to behavior as well; both house
styles and house construction materials are dealt with. All analyses are based on statistical
Samples of within-village and between-village samples.
(28) CURRENT RESEARCH IN COSTA RICAN ARCHAEOLOGY. With greatly increased govern-
ment support, the National Museum of Costa Rica has substantially increased research efforts in
recent years. Much of the research has focused directly or indirectly on Costa Rica’s
geographical and cultural position as a “buffer between Mesoamerican and South American in-
fluences. Preliminary results from a number of long-range projects are presented here, including
settlement, social, economic, trade, and mortuary patterns; basic chronological problems;
cultural resource management efforts; and art historical analyses and interpretations of some of
the archaeological data.

, (30) THE AGGRESSIVE FIELD LAB. Archaeological field labs are now the locus of the most in-
teresting new tests, analyses, and predictive theories in archaeology. This session will cover the
full range of activities associated with a modern field lab, including organization of excavated
materials; temporary or emergency field conservation; the application of a comprehensive yet
flexible computer storage and retrieval system; and other specific issues of lab strategy.
However, the emphasis will be less on what the lab can do than on what it should do. The session
will stress interaction with fieldwork and the predictive power of an efficient lab.
(31) CURATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS. In the past the storage of archaeological
collections has not been considered seriously. Recent federal legislation (NEPA, Executive Order
11593, and The Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act PL93-291) requires that ar-
chaeological sites be studied and protected. The result has been a tremendous increase in ar-
chaeological collections and documentation. Current research into the condition of nonfederal
repositories has shown that archaeologists must confront the curation problem. As a start in this
direction, the questions of who should curate collections and how they should be managed are
discussed here. Since these collections are the future data base, it is essential that ownership,
records, and storage be concise and well maintained. It is imperative that archaeologists become
involved in the long-term care of archaeological collections and documentation.
(33) THE BEHAVIORAL SIGNIFICANCE OF ARTIFACT PATTERNING, “NON-SITE,” “SITE,” AND
INTERNAL SITE STRUCTURE. This symposium brings together the majority of researchers who
have sought to accumulate ethnographically documented site structural information. It seeks to
achieve a “state of the art” form of presentation regarding our current understandings of the
sources for variability in the distribution of archaeological remains defining sites and regional
distributions. The emphasis is upon hunter-gatherer adaptations; however, it is projected that
much of what we observe may be of relevance to archaeologists working with peoples practicing
forms of food production. Although most archaeologists have assumed that “meaning” could be
assigned to spatial distributions of artifacts, little methodology has been developed to facilitate
this goal. It is hoped that the comparative discussion of the available “contro!” data presented
here will be a first step in the development of such methodology.
(34) JOINT SAA/CAA SESSION, THE EARLY PERIOD IN NORTHWEST COAST PREHISTORY. This
symposium will be devoted to the presentation and evaluation of cultural-historical and cultural-
environmental models relevant to Northwest Coast prehistory for the time period greater than
5.000 years ago. The emphasis will be on new information and its bearing on initial settlement,
subsistence, and cultural patterns.
(35) JOINT SAA/CAA SESSION. RECENT RESEARCH IN ESKIMO ARCHAEOLOGY I. Current work
illuminates poorly known areas such as Ellesmere Island, NPRA, and Northern Labrador. New
models and techniques provide a broader understanding of Arctic subsistence and settlement
patterns. And the growth of government agency archaeology in Alaska introduces new issues in
the conduct of Arctic research. At the same time, investigations of familiar problems in better
known areas continue to bear fruit. This symposium will enable far-flung Arctic specialists to ex-
change current research results and assess emerging developments in their area.
(36) ee SAA/CAA SESSION. PRE-CLOVIS EVIDENCE OF MAN IN NORTH AMERICA. In recent
years there have been claims for the discovery of a number of new archaeological manifestations
suggesting man’s presence in North America before the appearance of the Clovis cultural com-
plex. Some of these offer better claims to validity than others because of the nature of the various
archaeological contexts involved. This symposium is intended to present the evidence for a
number of these claims to in order to encourage more communication between investigators in-
volved in this area of research.
(37) WET/FROZEN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES—THE STRATEGIES, TECHNIQUES, RESEARCH,
AND POTENTIAL. Water-saturated archaeological sites (wet sites) throughout the world and
frozen sites in the northern hemisphere have produced large quantities of well-preserved
perishable materials. The recovery of wooden artifacts, basketry, cordage, hafted stone im-
plements, and other items contributes substantially to the overall understanding of regional
prehistories. These sites also have required the development of new excavation, preservation,
and research tactics. This symposium considers several sites, the techniques that have been
developed, and the future potential of wet/frozen site archaeology.
(42) ASPECTS OF LITHIC TECHNOLOGY. The purpose of the proposed symposium is to present a
series of papers that cover wide-ranging topics within lithic technology. In the past, symposia
have tended to focus on one aspect or another of lithic technology. This symposium will attempt
to present papers from as many facets of lithic technology as possible. Papers and discussions
will aim at providing information to the specialist, as well as the nonspecialist. in lithic tech-
nology.
22
, (43) JOINT SAA/ICAA SESSION. PREHISTORIC CULTURE CHANGE ON THE NORTHWEST
COAST OF NORTH AMERICA. The evolution of the societies occupying the Northwest Coast of
North America at contact is poorly understood despite the role these societies played in the for-
mation and development of North American anthropology. The archaeological record of the coast
makes it a particularly appropriate area to explore problems in the development of ranked
societies, subsistence and social intensification, and the effects of processes such as popula-
tion growth and environmental change. The papers in the symposium deal with aspects of these
problems, applying primarily new data to local, regional, or general problems of culture change.
(44) JOINT SAA/CAA SESSION. RECENT RESEARCH IN ESKIMO ARCHAEOLOGY II. See (35).
(45) JOINT SAA/CAA SESSION. THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF JOMON PREHISTORY IN
SOUTHWEST HOKKAIDO: THE OSHIMA PENINSULA. The origin and development of the Jomon
cultural tradition in Japan is known to have spanned some 15,000 years. Western knowledge con-
cerning this tradition is generally centered on information derived from the main island of Hon-
shu or the southern island of Kyushu. Hokkaido is viewed as a marginal island because of its
“severe” climate and northern position. Jomon research in Hokkaido has recently shown that its
marginality is due only to an absence of multifaceted archaeological investigations. A series of
Initial through Middle Jomon sites in the Oshima Peninsula of Southwest Hokkaido has revealed
formative cultures surprisingly equal in complexity to those in southern Japan and mainland
fa.
‘ Asia
(47) GEOARCHAEOLOGY. Geoarchaeology, the study of archaeological problems from an earth-
science perspective, is one of the major currents in contemporary archaeology. The traditional
emphasis on dating and paleoenvironmental reconstruction is now supplemented with attempts
. to deal with activity ares, settlement location, trade networks, diffusion, and site catchment ter-
ritories. The proposed symposium will present examples of current research in this direction.
(49) SESSION SPONSORED BY THE ASSOCIATION FOR FIELD ARCHAEOLOGY. SPATIAL
ANALYSIS IN OLD WORLD ARCHAEOLOGY: SOME METHODOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
This symposium will deal with a number of issues involving spatial analysis. While the main
theme is methodological, within that theme there is a considerable variability. Both intrasite and
intersite analyses are treated; the geographical coverage in the Old World is great, spanning Bri-
tain, Italy, Yugoslavia, Zambia, the Sudan, and Anatolia. Temporally, the studies range from
Neolithic to Late Roman. Methodological restraints such as plant cover, geomorphology, pat-
terns of refuse deposition, the limits of recording accuracy, and the very recent shift to a concern
for settlement information in some parts of the Old World are covered. Efforts to systematize and
effectively gather field data, as well as the matter of interpretation of the data, all come under
discussion.
(50) THE LATE HOLOCENE OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. The symposium will concentrate on
synthesizing recently acquired evidence for environmental reconstructions for the Late Holocene
of the Southern Plains. Geological, palynological, and malacologicail evidence will be integrated
‘ into the archaeological record in an attempt to better understand Late Holocene man-land rela-
tionships.

, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS
Abascal M, Rafael (INAH-Hidalgo) PREHISPANIC POTTERY VILLAGES Among the ways to
evaluate pre-Hispanic agricultural societies, the most abundant evidenceis that whichis revealed
through the processes of production of material life. In Tlaxcala, Mexico, we have been able clear-
ly to distinguish changes in modes of domestic production. This relates to subsistence and to the
more complex forms of production clearly manifested in the social division of jabor. In this study,
we base our position on the development of ceramic production between 1700 B.C. and time of
contact. (5)
Abel-Vidor, Suzanne (Brown and Museo Nacional de Costa Rica) TWO HEARTH-LIKE FEATURES
AT THE VIDOR SITE, BAY OF CULEBRA, GUANACASTE: CHARACTERISTICS, CONTEXTS, AND
CULTURAL IMPLICATIONS Although “hearths” with good archaeological context are rare in
Costa Rica, two were found (1977) during excavations at the Vidor site. Their formal characteris-
tics and spatial relations within the site suggest important cultural implications. Dating to the
Zoned Bichrome (300 B.C.-A.D. 300) and Early Polychrome (A.D. 300-800) periods, they are func- |
tionally interpreted as an earth oven and an open-pit ceramic kiln, respectively, on the basis of
physical traits and comparative data from a variety of archaeological and ethnographic cases. An
attempt is made to place the interpretations into a regional perspective within the Late For-
mative. (28)
Accola, Richard M. (Texas-Austin) POLYCHROME CERAMICS AND CLASSIFICATION IN
GUANACASTE PREHISTORY The polychrome ceramics characteristic of post-A.D. Guanacaste
confront the archaeologist with a complex array of decorative motifs. Past attempts at imple-
menting strictly typological classification systems have masked important spatial and temporal
differences. It is argued that an analytical (modal) approach using polythetic types best
delineates varying distributions. Illustrative examples are drawn from recent analysis of Middle
Polychrome Period (A.D. 800-1200) ceramics from the Vidor site, Bay of Culebra. (28)
Ackerman, R. E. (Washington State), T. D. Hamilton (U.S. Geological Survey), and R. Stuckenrath
(Smithsonian) EARLY CULTURAL COMPLEXES ON THE NORTHERN NORTHWEST COAST The
occupation of the northern sector of the Northwest Coast during the Early Period (circa 10,000-
5000 B.P.) is represented by a scattering of sites on the mainland and the offshore islands of the
Alexander Archipelago. Definition of the cultural phase(s) is thus far limited to lithic inventories.
Information thus far available indicates a considerable amount of contact among groups on the
coast and continuing relations with interior groups on the mainland. Characterization of the
coastal adaptations during this time period will be based mainly on data from archaeological and
geological investigations and from radiocarbon dating of sites in the Icy Strait-Lynn Canal region.

Adovasio, J. M. et al. (Pittsburgh) MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER: RETROSPECT 1978
Meadowcraft Rockshelter is a deeply stratified multicomponent site in Washington County,
southwestern Pennsylvania. The eleven well-defined stratigraphic units identified at the site pan
at least 16,000 and perhaps 19,000 years of intermittent occupation by groups representing all of
the major cultural stages/periods now recognized in northeastern North America. Throughout the
extant sequence, the site served as a locus for hunting, collecting, and food-processing activities
that involved the seasonal exploitation of the immediately adjacent Cross Creek valley and con-
tiguous uplands. Presently, Meadowcroft Rockshelter represents one of the earliest well-dated
evidences of man in the New World as well as the longest occupational sequence in the Western
Hemisphere. (45)
Adovasio, James M. (see Donahue, Jack) (47)
Albanese, John P. (Smithsonian) GEOLOGIC SETTING AT DUTTON AND SELBY: PRE-CLOVIS
SITES IN YUMA COUNTY, COLORADO The Dutton and Selby sites lie 27 km apart, and both occur
within closed topographic depressions occupied by playa ponds. The same sedimentary se-
quence exists at both sites and consists (in ascending order) of the Peorian Loess, a lacustrine
silt, a gley soil, and a thick planosol. Both sites contain butchered bone and bone tools made
from late Pleistocene animals. These artifacts occur in all units except the planosol. A Clovis
level is present at the base of the planosol at Dutton. The pre-Clovis artifact-bearing horizons are
estimated to range in age from 12,000 to 17,000 years B.P. (45)

, Aldenderfer, Mark S. WHAT MAKES A COMPUTER SIMULATION GOOD? Although simulation is
becoming increasingly important in modeling applications in archaeology, little work has been
done to specify the conditions under which simulation is valid. Because computer simulations
are usually complex and highly technical types of models, they require great care in both develop-
ment and use. And unlike many other types of models, the success or failure of a computer
simulation can be judged by a series of requirements or criteria that can be applied to a// simula-
tions. The “formula for success” of simulation models is discussed, and selected aspects of this
“formula” are illustrated through a simulation of assemblage formation processes, ABSIM. (20)
Ames, Kenneth M. (Boise State) THE EVOLUTION OF RANK SOCIETIES ON THE NORTHWEST
COAST The small, ranked societies on the Northwest Coast evolved autochthonously and with-
out agriculture. Ranked societies are seen as resulting from the interaction of two systems con-
straints and two processes. The constraints were the ecological and economic specialization in
salmon fishing, and environmental circumscription. The two processes were population growth
and promotion. Ranking evolves because under certain conditions it provides both improved
monitoring of the environment and improved responses to environmental shifts through informa-
tion flow. (43)
Ammerman, A., J. McDonough, and K. Quilty (SUNY-Binghamton) INTERPRETING NEOLITHIC
SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE ACCONIA AREA OF CALAGBRIA The paper examines the rela-
tionships between geomorphology and the visibility of sites identified during work. This is done

: using the Acconia area of Calabria as a case study. Dense patterns of Neolithic occupation were
observed in the area during recent survey work. A comprehensive map of geomorphological ex-
posures (i.e., areas favorable for the observation of surface material) was obtained from the inter-
pretation of color aerial photographs of the area. A comparison is made between this map and

: that showing the distribution of Neolithic sites from the survey. Preliminary results using tech-
niques in spatial analysis reveal a correlation between the two maps. Implications for the inter-
pretation of settlement systems are briefly discussed. (49)
Anderson, Dana Beth (New Mexico) SOURCES OF PATTERNING IN SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS
Ethnoarchaeological control data provide information for improving the basis for making judg-
ments as to the sources or identify of factors conditioning spatial patterning. Of particular impor-
tance is the consideration of the question in regard to systems specific, versus more general,
forms of patterning. (33)
Appel, Jill (Purdue) LITHIC PRODUCTION IN THE VALLEY OF OAXACA (MEXICO) This paper ex-
amines change through time in the organization of lithic production in the Valley of Oaxaca as
reflected in data from systematic surface survey. The emphasis is on comparing production in
the Late Postclassic to that of preceding periods and on discussing the relationship between
changes in the organization of production, the organization of exchange, and the organization of
the state. (5)
Arundale, Wendy H. (Burke Museum-Washington) QUARTZ, QUARTZ EVERYWHERE AND NOT A
“TOOL” IN SIGHT: FUNCTIONAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF CAPE DORSET SUR-
FACE COLLECTIONS Because clearly defined structures and faunal remains are often lacking,
archaeologists studying Pre-Dorset and Dorset sites rely heavily on analyses of lithic artifacts.
Although most of these analyses concentrate on formed tools, expedient tools and debitage can
also provide valuable information. This paper discusses the technological and functional
analyses of surface collections from three Cape Dorset area workshop components and con-
trasts them with findings from four other area sites. The results have important implications for
problems related to subsistence and settlement pattern change and for studies using surface
survey methods. (44)

Asch, Nancy B. and David L. Asch (Northwestern) ARCHAEOBOTANY OF THE KOSTER SITE: THE
EARLY AND MIDDLE ARCHAIC OCCUPATIONS Carbonized plant remains have been recovered
from a series of stratified Archaic occupational units at the Koster site, west-central Illinois,
dating back to 8700 B.P. Analysis of 14 Early and Middle Archaic units, representing two or more
settlement types, discloses a major change in plant utilizatin at ca. 7500 B.P. Nutshell is poorly
represented before this time, but later it is present in quantities indicative of intensive utilization.
Annual seed plants are almost completely absent. (15)

, Ball, Bruce F. (Simon Fraser) A STUDY OF SURFACE COLLECTIONS FROM ARCHAIC SITES IN
WESTERN KENTUCKY Data from surface collections are used to suggest optimal sampling grid
sizes for sampling archaeological site surface materials, Several sites in the lower Cumberland
River area of Western Kentucky were surface collected during the summer of 1978, point proven-
ience being taken on all materials. The locations of these materials were mapped, and variously
sized sampling grids were placed over the site areas fora comparison to be made between samp-
ling units of different size. (29)

Bankoff, H. A. and F. A. Winter (Brooklyn) A STRATEGY FOR REGIONAL SURVEY IN TEMPERATE
ZONE ENVIRONMENTS: THE MORAVA VALLEY PROJECT The paper outlines a cooperative
regional survey project involving Brooklyn College and the Beograd Narodni Muzej, involving sur-
face collection from a number of sites in the Morava Valley in Serbia, Yugoslavia. To be dis-
cussed are some of the restraints on surface survey characteristic of temperate zone environ-
ments and the development of a system that (1) could be used on a variety of sites regardless of
size or ground cover, (2) would provide Statistically comparable units from each site, (3) could
Serve as a guide for future surveys and excavations, and (4) would make most efficient use of time
and labor. (49)
Barbour, Jamie (Washington State) MICROSCOPIC IDENTIFICATION OF ARTIFACTUAL PLANT
MATERIALS FROM WET SITES Excellent preservation of perishable artifacts in wet and frozen
sites presents a basic problem of artifactual plant material identification. For artifact analysis
the researcher often needs to know which plants (both herbaceous and woody) and often which
plant parts were used. At the Hoko River wet site (45CA213) on the Northwest Coast this is being
accomplished to better understand: (1) the prehistoric use of the floral environment, (2) replica-
tion experiments with halted stone tools, cordage, baskelry, and fishhooks, and (3) problems of
conservation. Several microtechniques of identification are discussed including the use of the
Scanning Electron Microscope. (37)
Barton, C. Michael (University of Arizona) TERMINAL PLEISTOCENE ENVIRONMENTAL
CHANGE AND HUMAN ADAPTATION Significant, broad trends of environmental change at the
end of the Wisconsin in North America have emerged from correlation of a series of detailed,
regional paleoenvironmental sequences. These trends may be seen in a shift, over most of North
America, from a mixed environment of conifer-dominated forest and woodland to a differentiated
series of more homogeneous, regional communities. |t is suggested that such a shift may have
contributed to the decline of Late Pleistocene megafauna and to the appearance of the more
diversified, regional human adaptations that characterize the North American “Archaic.” Sugages-
| tions are made for testing this hypothesis. (29)
Baumler, Mark F. (Arizona) ANALYTIC COMPARABILITY AMONG FLAKE MEASUREMENT TECH-
NIQUES IN LITHIC ANALYSIS Methods in use for the measurement of flakes in lithic analysis are
examined in terms of their analytic potential and comparability. Specifically, the variables of
| length, width, and thickness are quantified using several different though widely employed
systems of measurement. One approach io examining analytic comparability is to compare and
contrast trends in flake size over time as represented by each technique. This is done using flake
samples from stratified Middle Paleolithic layers at the Mount Carmel! cave site of Tabun. Finally,
questions are raised regarding what each of these different Systems measures in terms of pre-
historic lithic technologies. (23)
Bearden, Susan E. (Southern Illinois) FUNCTIONAL AND SPATIAL VARIATION IN BASKET-

and how each site functioned within the settlement/subsistence system. Site locational analyses
and functional analyses of the chipped stone material collected from the sites will be performed
to meet the desired goals. (8)

from a stratified random sample; (b) present ceramic types that show similarities and differences
from the Chalchuapa sequence: (c) evaluate the inventory of vessels for a single Maya household
when it was buried by a voicanic eruption; (d) examine the Late Classic complex excavated under
controlled stratigraphic conditions in a comparative framework discussing influences from the
Southeastern Maya periphery and from other regions; (@) contrast materials from two survey
operations that suggest a later occupation of a prime area near the Rio Sucio. (11)

, Bernick, Kathryn (Victoria) LITTLE QUALICUM RIVER WET SITE, VANCOUVER ISLAND, BRITISH
COLUMBIA Excavations at the mouth of the Little Qualicum River, at a wet site (DiSc 1) on the
east coast of Vancouver, B.C., revealed an early Gulf of Georgia component dating approximately
from 1600 to 700 years B.P. Almost half of the artifact assemblage consists of items manu-
factured from perishable floral materials. Typologically these corroborate the functional classifi-
cation of the site as a fishing camp. Species identification of the floral cultural material is
remarkably consistent with the ethnographic record for the Gulf of Georgia Salish. (37)
Bevan, Bruce (M.A.S.C.A., Pennsylvania) ARCHAEOLOGICAL USES OF GROUND-PENETRATING
RADAR A ground-penetrating radar was used during 1978 at Valley Forge National Historical
Park, in conjunction with other geophysical instruments, to locate areas of archaeological poten-
tial while keeping excavation to a minimum. Refuse pits, lineaments of buried rocks, a cluster of
rocks that may have been an oven, and buried plow scars were located. Radar, like other geo-
physical techniques, is best used as an extrapolating tool for extending the information obtained
from small excavation windows. (6)

Binford, Lewis R. (New Mexico) SITE STRUCTURE AS A CLUE TO SITE FUNCTION Most previous
discussions of site structure, particularly those addressed to the remains of hunter-gatherer
adaptations, have considered the degree that one might expect tight spatial associations among
items used in single or closely related tasks conducted at a given site. While this problem is of
some interest, of greater general interest is the question of what conditions or “causes” the
variable spatial arrangement of artifacts and debris in the archaeological record. If we could
answer such a question, we could recognize or identify certain past conditions, or perhaps,
Stated more forcefully, we could identify certain general behavioral conditions and, in turn, site
functions. The identification of structural consequences of different behavioral conditions is
directly considered. (33)
Black, Kevin D. (Colorado) SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE ZAPOTITAN VALLEY, EL SALVA-
DOR An archaeological survey of 82 km? in the Zapotitan Valley in west-central E] Salvador has
located 54 prehistoric sites. Forty-two sites are of the Late Classic period, with some Late Pre-
classic and Early Postclassic occupation also apparent. No Early Classic sites are present, in-
dicating that destruction from the third century llopango eruption was total. Most sites cluster
near permanent water sources on level terrain, especially in the northern and western portions of
the valley, while the steep mountains to the south and east and the prehistorically swampy valley
floor were nearly uninhabited. (11)
Black, Thomas K., Ill (Southern Illinois-Carbondale) THE MMD AND POPULATION DISTANCES
The Mean Measure of Divergence, a measure of the “biological distance” between pairs of pop-
ulations, is shown to be sensitive not only to population size but to the length of the trait list used
in its computation. The employment of a very large number of traits almost invariably ensures
that the MMD will be statistically significant. This relationship between trait number and
statistical significance means that the researcher must thoroughly explore the contributions of
particular tratis to the MMD if he is to justify his results. (38)
Blake, Michael (Michigan) THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HOUSEHOLD MATERIAL CULTURE
AND SOCIAL PROCESSES IN A MODERN TZELTAL MAYAN COMMUNITY Ethnoarchaeologically
observed household material culture is seen to vary with social, political, economic, religious,
and demographic organization within a Mayan Indian community in Highland Chiapas. A model
of the relationships between material and nonmaterial aspects of modern Maya culture is pre-
sented focusing on the household level of organization. For each of these social processes, a set
of material indicators is isolated that is closely correlated with the process. Hypotheses about
the relationship between archaeologically observable material variation within a community and
the social processes that lead to that variation are tested and explored. (26)
Blake, Susan E. (Simon Fraser) HOUSE MATERIAL TYPE VARIATION IN HIGHLAND CHIAPAS
MAYAN COMMUNITIES This study presents the results of an analysis of the relationship be-
tween house material types and social organization, environmental adaptation, and acculturation
27
, in 45 present-day Mayan communities in highland Chiapas. The purpose of the study is to ex-
amine the cultural and environmental constraints that may influence household material varia-
tion, so that we may be in a better position to use archaeological data as an indicator of social
organization and environmental adaptation within prehistoric and Colonial Mayan communities.
Results of the preliminary analysis show that house materials vary from region to region, reflect-
ing the natural availability of raw materials. Some house and roof styles vary with respect to the
ethnic divisions between Tzeltal and Tojolabal Mayan groups. On the intracommunity level, our
data show that variation in house materials reflects social and economic differentiation. (26)

Blank-Roper, Laurie (Arizona State) RAW MATERIALS AND CHANGES IN SOCIOCULTURAL
COMPLEXITY: PINEDALE, ARIZONA Two seasons of work in the Pinedale, Arizona area indicate
that the archaeological remains are representative of a sociocultural system that developed from
a State of lesser to greater complexity. Reflecting this change, likely to be observable in the ar-
chaeological record are changes in the use of lithic raw materials and the type and sources of
materials utilized. Density of raw material types and Stages of manufacture are examined
through time and with respect to site type to determine the nature of changes in the utilization of
raw materials during a period of increasing sociocultural complexity in this area. (27)

prehistory by identifying (1) the nature of the social unit reflected by Yagi and similar sites and (2)
the subsistence technology upon which they rested. In addition to these results, as a cooperative
undertaking the Yagi project affords an opportunity to elucidate and assay the methodological

ferred from bone remains provides insights into pre-Clovis peoples’ lithic production potential.
When the technological transfer concept is taken into account and the repertoire of
technological concepts available for artifact production is reconstructed, greater continuity can
be seen between pre-projectile point and projectile point traditions. (45)

Bronitsky, Gordon (Texas-Permian Basin) ECONOMIC CHANGE IN THE RIO GRANDE VALLEY
The late prehistoric period of the Rio Grande Valley is one of increasing variability and uncertain-
ty due to population increase and local climatic fluctuation. Trade serves to expand the agricul-
tural niche of local populations by increasing resource diversity. At the same time, reduction in
agricultural land bases leads to greater resort to craft specialization, mass production, and bank-
ing of crop surpluses in “luxury goods.” The model is evaluated in terms of regional data and
ability to explain other regional phenomena and account for differential survival of local pop-
ulations. (21)

Brooks, Alison S. (George Washington) and John E. Yellen (Smithsonian) DETERMINANTS OF
SITE PATTERNING AMONG KALAHARI SAN Further studies of land utilization by Kalahari San
have shown that distinctive types of sites occur and that differences between them are condi-
tioned primarily by activity differences. However, within these sites or classes of sites, the pat-
terning of remains continues to be determined primarily by social factors such as group size and
composition, functional considerations playing a lesser role, In this paper, we discuss different
types of sites and factors that govern archaeological visibility, intrasite patterning, and intersite
differences for each of them. (33)

: Brown, J. A. and R. K. Vierra (Northwestern) KOSTER SITE RESEARCH: AN OVERVIEW This paper
reviews the cultural-ecological approach that has directed research of the Koster site, and it
evaluates the progress made toward explaining the many changes observed in the ar-
chaeological record found in the sequence of Archaic Period components (ca. 8700-4000 B.P.).
Our position has been that (1) a shift in subsistence patterns through time, (2) a trend toward

: greater commitment to permanent facilities, and (3) a trend toward multiseasonal occupation of
base camp settlements are the result of the shift in hunter-gatherer strategies in response to the
expansion in resource potential of the aquatic and riverine habitats in the Ilinois River Valley dur-
ing the mid-Holocene. The basic model underlying this position will be compared with other
models of hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement change. (15)

Brown, Ken (Houston) ECOLOGY AND SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS N THE GUATEMALAN
HIGHLANDS Two major settlement system types have been identified ethnographically and ar-
chaeologically within the Highlands of Guatemala. Vacant center systems are characterized by
large centers with only a very small “permanent” resident population. The remainder of the sup-
porting population is scattered throughout the rural hinterland. Nucleated systems are
characterized by nucleated settlements that usually include a hierarchy of size and density. Two
valley systems within the Highlands of Guatemala have received intensive systematic ar-
chaeological/ecological surveys: the Valley of Guatemala and the Quiche Basin. Data from these
areas demonstrate the pre-Columbian development of these two settlement systems. The paper
attempts to demonstrate that the major set of determining factors in their development was the
ecology of the two valley areas, specifically the distribution of basic research (agricultural land,
water, lithic raw materials). (9)
Bruder, J. Simon (Arizona State). PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT/SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES IN
THE UPLANDS OF CENTRAL ARIZONA The formulation of a settlement/subsistence mode! ap-
plicable to the late prehistoric period in the uplands of Central Arizona is discussed. The project
area may be viewed as a specific case of a widespread archaeological situation that appears to
reflect similar events in a number of mountainous zones located on the peripheries of the
Gila/Salt River Basin during the twelfth through the fifteenth centuries A.D. Specifically, it is pro-
posed that a population shift resulting from stress in adjacent lowlands caused production levels
in the mountain zone to increase to greater intensity than that usually associated with wild food
collectors. (8)
Brunson, Judy L. (Arizona State) CORRUGATED CERAMICS AS INDICATORS OF INTERACTION

based on Black-on-white ceramic studies are compared with those based on corrugated ceramics
and the symmetry, directionality, and duration as well as magnitude of the interaction spheres in-
volved are discussed. (8)
Bryan, Alan (Alberta) A DIRECTED SEARCH FOR “PRE-CLOVIS” MAN Realization that several
technologies in addition to Clovis were present in various parts of America by 11,000 B.P. means
that the search for immediate technological origins for paleo-Indian complexes in the contem-
porary Siberian Upper Paleolithic may be nonproductive. Instead, several advanced “Upper
29
, paleolithic-like” technologies evidently developed indigenously in various parts of America.
Substitution of a model of indigenous multilinear development for the generally accepted model
of migration and/or diffusion to explain the immediate technological antecedents of paleo-Indian
complexes would stimulate establishment of a directed search for stratigraphically secure
evidence for nonstandardized tool forms and simple manufacturing techniques brought by the
earliest American colonists, which formed the basic tool kit from which several more complex
and Standardized technologies developed in various parts of America. (45)
Bryant, Vaughn M. and Glendon H. Weir (Texas A&M) PREHISTORIC DIETS IN THE AYACUCHO
REGION OF PERU: THE COPROLITE EVIDENCE Over 100 coprolites were examined from
deposits in Pikimachay and other nearby archaeological sites in the Ayacucho region of Peru
covering a time span of more than 7,000 years. Pollen, plant, and animal remains from these
coprolites suggest a food economy centered primarily on the gathering of wild plant foods with
some hunting of small mammals. Certain economic plant types can be recognized, but coprolite
evidence for the widespread use of agricultural plants is lacking. (1)
Budy, Elizabeth and Lonnie Pippin (Social Sciences Center, Nevada) RESEARCH AND DESIGN IN
CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY: AN EXAMINATION OF TWO SAMPLING DESIGNS Archaeological
Sampling procedures under conditions of large-scale mitigation projects are necessarily con-
strained, to one extent or another, by contract requirements; however, these constraints should
not preciude systematic research objectives. Two distinct sampling designs, employed on ar-
chaeological surveys undertaken by the Social Sciences Center, are critically examined in terms
of specific contract restraints and individual research objectives. A design that elicits only
descriptive information is contrasted to one that is well suited to problem-oriented research, i.e.,
the IPP Powerline Survey and the Nevada Test Site Cultural Resource Management Program. (4)

IN PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT-SUBSISTENCE SYSTEMS TO CLIMATIC CHANGES IN NORTH-
CENTRAL OKLAHOMA The role of climatic change as a causal agent for culture change has long
been an important topic in southern Plains prehistory. North-central Oklahoma, because it spans
an ecological transition area, presents a good opportunity to study the interaction of climate and
cultural behavior. This paper will be directed toward the construction of a preliminary mode!
relating changes in prehistoric settlement-subsistence systems to data for climatic change in
north-central Oklahoma, Although certain changes in settlement-subsistence activities seem to
represent an adaptation to environmental change, others do not. (50)

Burley, David V. (Simon Fraser) SPECIALIZATION AND THE EVOLUTION OF COMPLEX SOCIETY
IN THE GULF OF GEORGIA The Coast Salish cultural pattern is viewed as a specialized hunting
and gathering adaptation that has evolved out of a more generalized format. It is suggested that
the potential for, and incentives behind, the beginnings of this transition would occur first at the
western edge of the Fraser Canyon. However, it is also maintained that the full development
could not take place until positioned in a coastal setting. Providing an evolutionary model to ac-
count for the Salishan pattern, the interface between the Marpole and Locarno Beach culture
types (cirGa 400 B.C.) is taken to be the actual point of transition. Archaeological data provide par-
tial documentation for the proposed developments. (43)
Butzer, Karl W. (Chicago) THE SCOPE OF GEOARCHAEOLOGY Geoarchaeology represents arch-
aeological research using earth science techniques. It is not a body of techniques but a matter of
geoscience (geography, pedology, geology) methodologies that contribute both empirical infor-
mation and conceptual approaches to understanding the multiscale setting and environmental
dynamics of prehistoric groups, i.e., context. Geoarchaeologists must be able to evaluate diverse
data and then apply them toward multidisciplinary modeling of subsistence-settlement systems.
A more effective contextual paradigm of archaeology, in which geoarchaeology would serve as a
central approach, must evolve from within the discipline. (47)
Byland, Bruce E. (Penn State) A LOCATIONAL APPROACH TO CULTURAL EVOLUTION IN THE
MIXTECA ALTA REGION OF OAXACA, MEXICO Diachronic locational analyses of cultural and
environmental data derived from a recent archaeological survey conducted in the Tamazulapan
valley in the Mixteca Alta are used to generate a new model of the evolution of sociopolitical and
economic complexity in the Mixteca Alta between 1300 B.C. and A.D. 1520. The evolution of rank-
ing and stratification in the area is viewed as a product of both internal development and external
contact. A history of alternating periods of relative isolation and extraregional integration gave
rise ultimately to the complex array of semiautonomous cacicazgos encountered by the Spanish
at the time of the conquest. (9)

, Byrd, Brian F. (Arizona) SURFACE AND SUBSURFACE ARTIFACT VARIABILITY An understanding
of the relationship between surface and subsurface artifact variability in terms of size, horizontal
distribution, frequency, and classes of artifacts represented requires identification of both the
natural and cultural formation processes operating upon a site and the magnitudes of the effects
of such processes. Without this knowledge, behavioral inferences derived from surface artifact
assemblages are suspect. The size effect model (House and Schiffer 1975; Baker 1978) attempts
to explain one aspect of site variability. Additional insights on this problem are presented, based
on data obtained from Az P:14:176, a single-component site excavated by the University of
Arizona in 1978. (38)
Cable, John S. and Rachel Most (Arizona State) THE BIPOLAR TECHNIQUE: ERROR OR ADAPTA-
TION? When first recognized in the archaeological record of North America by Binford and Quimby
(1963) at several Late Woodiand sites in Michigan, the bipolar technique was considered
something of a novelty. With time, however, the geographical distribution and temporal context
of the phenomenon have been significantly expanded. A strong case can be made that the bipolar
technique as an observational phenomenon has existed in the archaeological record since at
least the Pleistocene-Holocene transition and probably on a continent or worldwide scale. (42)
Campbell, Sarah (Washington) LATE PREHISTORIC STURGEON PROCUREMENT ON THE
LOWER COLUMBIA RIVER: THE EVIDENCE FROM HAMILTON ISLAND, SKAMANIA COUNTY,
WASHINGTON Archaeological investigations in Skamania County, Washington, provide
: evidence that sturgeon fishing was a stable and important prehistoric subsistence activity. Oc-
cupational debris recovered from Hamilton Island spanning the fourteenth to seventeenth cen-
turies is characterized by abundant weights and sturgeon bone. Intercomponent analysis in-
dicates no significant functional change through time, while functional contrasts with other sites
establish that this locale is a distinct seasonal station. Cessation of sturgeon fishing on
. Hamilton Island before contact may indicate a general shift in resource use and account for the
discrepancy between the ethnographic and archaeological records on the importance of
sturgeon procurement. (3)

Carlson, Catherine EARLY NON-SHELL COMPONENTS FROM PORT HARDY, BRITISH GOLUM-
BIA The content and meaning of lithic assemblages from two nonshell strata underlying a classic
shell midden site on the northern end of Vancouver Island (Hardy Bay) are described and ex-
plored. The earliest of the nonshell zones is associated with a raised beach deposit and consists
of a prepared flake industry with leaf-shaped points. The younger nonshell zone underlies the
shell deposit on the lower terrace of the site and is associated with present-day sea levels. This
zone contains evidence of both chipped stone and bone industries. Also present are fish, land
mammal, sea mammal, and bird remains. The relationship of these components to others of the
same period Is explored. (34)
Carlson, David L. (Illinois State) MOBILITY STRATEGIES AND SITE STRUCTURE AT KOSTER A
model for hunter-gatherer mobility strategies is developed in terms of the environmental and
demographic processes determining differences in mobility. The implications of the model for
Site structure are discussed in order to relate shifts in mobility to shifts in the organization of
Space within the site. The distribution of various categories of debris for 12 components at Koster
(Horizons 8 through 10) is then examined for the presence of the postulated distinctions in site
organization. Principal components analysis is utilized to isolate patterns in debris by-products.
The presence of a base camp in Horizon 8C (7000 B.P.) is discussed in terms of its implications
for the Midwestern Archaic. (15)
Carlson, Roy L. THE EARLY PERIOD ON THE CENTRAL COAST OF BRITISH COLUMBIA Unlike
all other periods of Central Coast prehistory, the Early Period is typified by a high frequency of
flaked stone tools. These assemblages include tools of diverse types: pebble tools, leaf-shaped
bifaces, microblades, macroblades, and prepared (Levallois-like) flakes and cores. This paper ex-
plores the question of both the external affinities of these industries and their relationship to the
way of life during the period. (34)
Casteel, Richard W. (Simon Fraser) ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY AND A TEST OF SOME BASIC ZOO-
ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRECEPTS Ethnoarchaeological data are used to test the accuracy of
predictions made from zooarchaeological devices. The results indicate that taxonomic lists from
archaeological faunas are equal to or better than those from ethnographic sources. In addition,
biases in rates of identification and recovery of faunal remains may be discovered and adjusted
for. Ordinal abundance of taxa from archaeological faunas is generally positively correlated with
ethnoarchaeological data. Behavior of various MNI indices is also examined, and the results in-
dicate rejection of both Ducos' (1975) and Gromova's (1948) theses. (25)

at the Cambio site in west-central El Salvador revealed the existence of a complex stratigraphic
sequence of three distinct prehistoric occupations “sandwiched” between ash deposits from
four volcanic eruptions. Data recovered from the excavations have provided insights into
diachronic culture change at Cambio and have aided in the interpretation of sites recorded during
the Zapotitan Valley survey. Soils analyses have provided valuable data on the changing agricul-
tural potential of prehistoric soils; these data are of special importance to the understanding of
human recovery from the impacts of volcanic eruptions in the Zapotitan Valley. (11)

Choyke, Alice M, (SUNY-Binghamtom) ANALYSIS OF BONE/ANTLER TOOLS IN A METAL USING
SOCIETY Little work has been done on the role of bone/antler tool industries in metal-using
prehistoric society. Bone and antler are not such amorphous raw materials as either stone or
metal. The study presented here attempts to work out the numerous classification problems
associated with a tool category where the tool function and form is so closely linked to the
original bone type. From there the study goes on to a consideration of the role of bone/antler
tools in the Bronze age. The previously unanalyzed material comes from Pakozdvar, a major hill-
fortress occupied during the middle Bronze age in Hungary. (23)
Ciolek-Torrelio, Richard (Arizona) LATE MOGOLLON SETTLEMENT IN CENTRAL ARIZONA The
thirteenth-century occupation of the mountain region south of the Mogolion Rim and north of the

Museum in two small basins in this region provide essential information about other aspects of
the system. Comparison of these data with that of other surveys in the region makes possible a
trial reconstruction of the regional settlement system. The development of this system and its im-
plications for regional subsistence and exchange are discussed. (8)

IN BRITAIN Although the U.K. lacks legislation comparable with NEPA or Moss-Bennet, British
archaeologists have advanced further than their U.S. colleagues in one important aspect of
cultural resource management. An archaeological input is now regularly taken into account in
most planning decisions. Planning law in the U.K. is comprehensive: as a result of successive
legistation since 1947, official approval is required for almost any action that involves the land-
32

,
, Scape. There is an elaborate structure of planning authorities, from central government down-
wards, and provision is made for public consultation at most Stages. Long-term strategies and
shorter-term plans are constructed by these authorities, and archaeological constraints are in-
creasingly being incorporated into these plans. (39)

Cook, Thomas Genn (Indiana) KOSTER SITE: MIDDLE ARCHAIC CURATORIAL BEHAVIOR A
mode! for prehistoric curatorial behavior is tested using fabricated, incremental, and incidental
tools recovered from five Archaic occupations at the Koster site. In general, fabricated tools
(hafted forms) are recovered in broken or worn-out condition while usable ones were system-
atically removed (curated) in prehistory. Incremental tools (manos) are left behind for potential
future use (cached). Incidental tools (utilized flakes) are simply discarded. Implications for

trum of activities performed on a prehistoric living floor. (15)
Cordell, Linda S. (New Mexico) DETERMINISTIC VS. STOCHASTIC SIMULATION OF ANASAZI
HABITATION SITE LOCATION AND LAND USE Simplified flow diagrams illustrate two kinds of
simulation models designed to predict changes in the location of Anasazi residential sites and
the amount of land needed to support them. The simulations mode! survey data from Mesa Verde,
Colorado. Examples of generated output suggest that simple deterministic models are frequently
more productive for archaeological questions unless investigators are explicitly concerned with
the long-term effects of variables that are known to behave in a stochastic manner or when
generated data are to be used for testing specific techniques of statistical analysis. (20)
Cowan, C. Wesley and Richard |. Ford (Michigan) EARLY AGRICULTURE: EVIDENCE FROM
CLOUDSPLITTER ROCK SHELTER, KENTUCKY Cloudspitter Rock Shelter, located in the Red
River Gorge in eastern Kentucky, has yielded a sequence of normally perishable plant and animal
data resulting from sporadic seasonal occupations beginning ca. 8000 B.C. to A.D. 1200. A long
Archaic sequence produced two varieties of Squash (Cucurbita pepo and C. pepo var. Ovifera) and
bottle gourd (Lagenaria siceraria), perhaps antecedent in this complex stratigraphic deposit to
the native cultigens sumpweed (/va annua var. macrocarpa), sunflower (Helianthus annuus),
goosefoot (Chenopodium bushianum), and maygrass (Phalaris caroliniana). Theoretical issues
and practical considerations of preceramic hunting, gathering, and gardening in the evolving
Mixed Mesophytic forest will be discussed. (29)

: Cowgill, George L. (Brandeis) POLITICO-ECONOMIC FACTORS IN THE DISINTEGRATION OF
EARLY STATES Politicoeconomic factors are commonly mentioned among causes for disintegra-
tion of early states but sometimes given insufficient attention. There may be a one-sided em-
phasis on environmental disasters as prime causes of sociopolitical disasters, as in recent
discussions of the collapse of Old Kingdom Egypt. However, Chinese history illustrates politico-
economic processes that lead to political disaster even without environmental disasters. These
Processes were probably also present in Old Kingdom Egypt, and they may have been at least as
important as environmental events in bringing about the collapse, The methodological implica-
tions are relevant for all early civilizations. (46)

, Cox, Steven L. (Smithsonian) THE LARGE AND THE SMALL—A VIEW OF DORSET ECONOMY In
1966 W. E. Taylor characterized Eskimo economy in general, including Dorset, as being fund-
amentally omnivorous and flexible. The degree of flexibility of Dorset economic adaptations has
important implications in relation to current models of Dorset population expansion and extinc-
tion, as well as to questions concerning the replacement of Dorset by Thule in the eastern Arctic.
In this paper various aspects of the Dorset economic system, including resource utilization, set-
tlement pattern, and extractive technology, are examined with particular reference to the degree
of variability and flexibility present within the system. Data from northern Labrador and
Southampton Island constitute the primary basis of the analysis, although other areas will also
be considered. (35)
Crawford, Gary W. (North Carolina) THE PALEOETHNOBOTANY OF COASTAL OSHIMA PENIN-
SULA, HOKKAIDO Plant remains from four Jomon sites representing seven archaeological com-
ponents spanning 5,000 years in the coastal Oshima Peninsula are reported. The large quantity
and variety of plant remains recovered by flotation reflect human-environmental interactions that
help explain the successful Jomon adaptation in southwestern Hokkaido. Hypotheses regarding
site disruption, increased sedentism, plant husbandry, and Hokkaido Jomon subsistence pat-
terns are examined from a diachronic perspective. Early through Middle Jomon subsistence
ecologies are quite similar and contrast with the subsistence ecology of the Initial Jomon. Her-
baceous weeds, riverine plants, and forest-edge plants were most important for food from about
4000 B.C. on. (36)
Creamer, Winifred (Tulane) REPORT ON PRELIMINARY SURVEY IN THE UPALA AREA (ALA-
JUELA) COSTA RICA A short survey sponsored by the Museo Nacional! of Costa Rica conducted
by the author in July 1978 is reported. The area surveyed is little known and is located in north-
central Costa Rica on the coastal plain south of Lake Nicaragua and north of the Guanacaste .
mountains. Preliminary analysis of the materials collected through quadrant sampling proce-
dures indicates that a substantial population was present in this area during pre-Hispanic times.
Most of the locations sampled appear to date later than A.D. 300. (28)
Croes, Dale R. (Washington State) OZETTE VILLAGE AND HOKO RIVER WET SITES: 3,000 YEARS
OF NORTHWEST COAST PREHISTORY Two Northwest Coast wet sites, representing approx-
imately 3,000 years of Washington Coast prehistory, are being jointly investigated. The Ozette
site is a complete section of a Northwest Coast village. including numerous plank houses, that
was covered and preserved by a massive clay mudslide approximately 500 years B.P. The nearby
Hoko River site is a “seasonal” fishing station where numerous layers of offshore deposits con-
tain preserved perishable artifacts. The site represents a time span from approximately 3000 to
1000 years B.P. Comparative analyses of both sites demonstrate considerable temporal continu-
ity for major Northwest Coast hunting and fishing procurement techniques as well as woodwork-
ing and basketry technologies. (37)
Cross, John R. (Massachusetts) SEASONALITY OF SHELLFISH UTILIZATION IN BOSTON HAR-
BOR Shellfish represent a predictable, year-round food resource for hunter-gatherers. There are
reasons to expect only seasonal use of these resources: the need for a dependable food source
before fhe anadromous fish runs in the early spring; heat efficiency of protein metabolism in
winter; and avoidance of paralytic shellfish poisoning in summer. Interpretations of daily growth
lines in shells of Venus mercenaria and Mya arenaria recovered from Boston Harbor middens pro-
vide the framework for determining the seasonality of shellfish utilization and for understanding
the nature of shell midden accumulation. (24)

Davis, Anthony M. (Toronto) POLLEN ANALYSES FROM HOKKAIDO JOMON SITES Pollen from
the Hamanasuno and Yagi sites has low concentration and small variety. The limited recoveries,
partly caused by high soil pH (6.5), are largely attributable to the lack of a palynological perspec-
tive in the selection of materials for analysis. However, some useful conclusions regarding
regional and local vegetation can be made. A mixed conifer-hardwood regional vegetation is sug-
gested. Local pollen assemblages imply open sites dominated by weeds and shrubs. No cultigen '
pollen was identified. The paper considers the problems of collection and processing, discusses
the results of the preliminary analyses, and suggests strategies for future research. (36)
Davis, Hester (Arkansas Archeological Survey) THE PROBLEMS AND ETHICS OF BUDGETS AND |
COST ACCOUNTING Visions of unlimited funds for archaeology have sometimes gone to the ar-
chaeojogist’s head, Lack of experience in real worid budgeting has caused people to estimate
budget proposals unrealistically; items may be included in budgets that are neither appropriate
nor legal. Rising competition in contracting sometimes means unrealistically low budgets are
presented in order to ensure getting the contract. Being accountable for what is spent is also a
34
, new world to archaeology. Many of these practices are damaging the credibility of archaeology
and sometimes damaging the resources. Many of them are illegal, or unethical, or both. (17)
Deal, Michael (Simon Fraser) RITUAL-USE POTTERY IN AN ONGOING CULTURAL SYSTEM
Ethnoarchaeological data from the Central Chiapas Highlands show that the Mayan family altar
provides a useful context for distinguishing ritual-use pottery in archaeological households. It is
also possible archaeologically to distinguish ritual-specific types other than the incense burner.
These include locally made plainwares such as specialized colanders, large fiesta cooking pots,
and candle-making cups, which are associated with high cargo positions. Other criteria, such
as degree of curation, type frequencies, and reuse and industrial replacement behaviors, are also
useful for recognizing ritual pottery types. (26)

PRODUCTION IN THE SOUTHWEST: A PRELIMINARY VIEW While different forms of ceramic pro-
duction have been documented for the Southwest, the conditions that lead to these differences
remain obscure. To address this problem, characteristics of group organization that supported
specialized manufacture in the Southwest are studied through a comparative analysis of ceramic
production in several different regions. The resultant patterns are discussed, and inferences for
the general study of the development of craft specialization are considered. The analysis is
evaluated in terms of the limitations of data and methods, and suggestions are made for future
. work. (14)

Dekin, Albert A., Jr. (SUNY-Binghamton) PREDATORY ARCHAEOLOGY: TERRITORIALITY AND
THE RESOURCE BASE A predation model of contract archaeology is appropriate for two reasons.
First, contract archaeologists are consumers of the cultural resource base. Second, they tend to
establish research domains or territories. These factors lead to ethical judgments in matters of
consumption and of territorial defense and encroachment. With active responsibility for cultural
resources shifting from local archaeologists to federal managers, ethical conflicts increase, and
ethical judgments become more complex, reflecting the competing interests of individuals and
institutions involved with cultural resource management, The present ethical chaos will continue
until explicit and measurable standards for the process and product of archaeological research
are adopted, (17)
Del Bene, Terry A. (Connecticut) HANDEDNESS AND BURIN MANUFACTURE: AN EXPERIMEN-
TAL STUDY It has been suggested that an examination of the orientations of burin spall removals
can be employed to determine the overall handedness proportions of an aboriginal population. In
order to test this assumption, populations of modern flintworkers were sampled, and the results
compared with archaeological samples. Results indicate that modern flintworkers tend not to
reveal any indication of population handedness. However, a number of archaeological samples
Suggest that there may have been more of a tendency for orienting flakes in a certain manner dur-
ing spall removal. Whether this indicates population handedness or not requires further study,
since a number of other factors may affect flake orientation during spall removal. (42)
Deniro, Michael J. and Samuel Epsigin ;Galtech). ANALYSIS OF THE USE OF MAIZE AS A
DIETARY CONSTITUENT FROM THE ~C/'*C RATIOS OF COLLAGEN IN FOSSIL HUMAN BONE:
TEHUACAN VALLEY, MEXICO AND VIRU VALLEY, PERU Variations of '°C/12C ratios of collagen
in human bones from the Tehuacan Valley and the Viru Valley are interpreted in terms of changes
in the dietary utilization of maize. In Tehuacan, the data Suggest that maize was introduced and
became an important food source between the E| Riego and Coxcatlan phases and that its contri-
bution to the diet remained constant from the Coxcatian through the Venta Salada phases. In the
Viru Valley, there is isotopic evidence for the introduction of maize by the Mayazgo period and for
its heavy utilization as a food source from the Puerto Moorin through the Moche periods. (1)
Dent, Richard J, (National Colonial Farm) ECOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY AND THE AGGRES-
SIVE FIELD LABORATORY This paper specifically addresses an aspect of the aggressive field
lab: the task of preserving ecological information, which is increasingly being extracted from ar-
chaeological sites. Quite clearly, it is also making a statement about responsibility to produce
competent scientists for the collection of these data as well as the need for basic ecological data
sets, which must be collected from every archaeological site because of the nonrenewable
nature of the discipline’s information base. Collection of ecological data in conjunction with the
Upper Delaware Valley Early Man Project is employed to illustrate this manifesto. (30)
Dibble, Harold L, (Arizona) DEVELOPING MOTOR PATTERNS OF UPPER PLEISTOCENE
HOMINIDS: EVIDENCE FROM THE ANALYSIS OF LITHIC MATERIALS FROM TABUN CAVE
(ISRAEL) Differential motor capabilities represent one potential factor contributing to lithic
35
, variability. Recent controlled experiments in lithic technology make it possible to begin to under-
stand the relationship between stone artifacts and the motor patterns of those who made them.
On the basis of these results, this paper examines Upper Acheulian and Mousterian materials re-
covered from the Tabun Cave and demonstrates how certain aspects of the variability existing
among these assemblages can be placed into the context of developing motor capabilities of the
hominids in that area. (23)

GUATEMALA: AN APPLICATION OF LINEAR PROGRAMMING TO THE SIMULATION OF AN AR-
CHAEOLOGICAL PROBLEM Estimates of the size of the population during the Late Classic
period at the Lowland Maya site of Tikal, Guatemala are reviewed. Linear programming is sug-
gested as a method for simulating the agricultural carrying capacity of the site and inferring the
center's potential population. The results of 20 computer runs with linear programs, calculating
the maximum population supportable by different combinations of milpa, intensive farming, and
arboriculture, are discussed. Results tentatively suggest a mixed subsistence strategy, that com-
bined ramon seed arboriculture and intensive root cropping supplemented by kitchen gardening,
hunting, gathering and trade might have supported a population as high as 70,551 people within
the Tikal sustaining area during the Late Classic period. (20)
Dieh|, Richard A. (Missouri-Columbia) MEXICAN GULF COAST SETTLEMENT PATTERNS: PROB-
LEMS AND SOLUTIONS Settlement pattern studies of Formative Mexican Gulf Coast societies
encounter problems that make it more difficult to reconstruct sociopolitical organization from
settlement data than is the case in the Mexican highlands. These problems are illustrated by the
Rio Chiquito, Veracruz, survey of Formative and modern communities. They include incomplete
survey, absence of surface remains, site invisibility and alteration, and inadequate chronological
control. Alternative interpretations of the same data sets illustrate the potential range of confu-
sion. Solutions include judicious use of contemporary settlement pattern and landscape forma-
tion data, remote sensing, monitoring construction activities, maintenance of close contact with
local residents, and systematic use of test pits for chronological control. (9)
Dirst, Victoria (Wisconsin-Oshkosh) FAUNAL REMAINS FROM SAUER RESORT The Sauer Resort
site in east-central Wisconsin has yielded a large quantity of faunal remains. Preliminary
analysis of this collection substantiates the belief that the Lake Winnebago phase of the Oneota
made seasonally intensive use of fauna dwelling in and near the marshes and lakes of this
region. Economic pursuits suggested by the faunal remains include the spearing of large fish; the
hunting of birds, beaver, raccoons, deer, and elk; the procuring of turtles and frogs; and the use of
scapula hoes and other bone tools probably manufactured during the winter at a separate camp.

Dobyns, Susan (Arizona) IDENTIFYING ETHNICITY IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD Several
of the social sciences have addressed the issue of ethnicity, but rarely has this problem been ex-

chaeology through (1) a critical review of social sclence understanding of ethnicity, particularly
the relationship and utility of extant data for archaeological identification and explanation of
ethnicity and (2) an examination of potentials for ethnicity-archaeology research. (12)
Dolphin, Lambert (SRI International) GEOPHYSICAL PROSPECTING IN ARCHAEOLOGY A joint
team from SRI International and the Egyptian Organization of Antiquities has been working
together since 1974 to apply both newly developed and traditional geophysical techniques in
Egypt. During three sessions’ fieldwork at Giza, Saqqara, and Luxor, the team has employed
ground-penetrating radar, acoustic sounding, resistivity, and magnetometry for several unusual
exploration tasks. The value of such methods Is that they can guide the archaeologist and im-
prove his efficiency in subsequent excavations. Acoustic sounding appears to be useful in study-
ing the interior of structures such as the Pyramids or locating missing tombs in the Valley of the
Kings. (47)

MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER. Geology provides a useful physical framework to aid in inter-
preting archaeological sites. At Meadowcroft Rockshelter, three sources, rock fall, attrition, and
sheet wash, contribute sediments to the colluvial pile that contains cultural material. Spatial and
36
, temporal changes in amount of sediment from the three sources reflect both climatic and living
floor topographic change. Placement of rock fall episodes and thickness changes of the 11
natural Strata on the excavation grid allows reconstruction of paleotopography for successive liv-
ing floors. (47)

Donahue, Randolph E. (Michigan State) LAND-USE OF THE “HIGH COUNTRY" IN NORTHWEST
CALIFORNIA The “High Country" has long been considered a sacred area by the Northwest
California Indians. An archaeological survey was recently completed to determine the extent of
religious, economic, and social activities that had occurred there in the past. Using ethnographic
data, six hypotheses were proposed as to the use of the study area. These include its use for
religious activities, the exploitation of salmon, acorns, and large game animals, as a refuge from
epidemics in the lowlands, and for intertribal councils. Preliminary results indicate that this area
was used to a much greater extent than previously suspected. (32)

Doyel, David E. (Arizona State Museum) PUEBLO II PERIOD SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE
IN THE UPPER LITTLE COLORADO REGION, EAST-CENTRAL ARIZONA A high density of Pueblo
il period (A.D. 900-1750) settlements was discovered to exist in waterless areas located some
distance from the major drainages in the vicinity of Springerville, Arizona. Locational,
technological, palynological, and botanical data recovered through excavation and survey are
employed to demonstrate that settlements were located in the area to take advantage of exten-
sive sand dunes, which were used for farming. Speculation is presented about why these dune
fields were utilized only during the Pueblo I! period when much greater time depth occurs in near-

: by areas. Implications for regional settlement system models are discussed. (48)

Drucker, Philip (Baylor) A TECHNO-ECOLOGICAL MODEL OF NORTHWEST COAST RESOURCE
EXPLOITATION This mode! analyzes the interaction of three distinctive Northwest Coast

4 technological subsets; subDsistants, water transport, and large structures, through which raw
resources were converted to winter stores. It is hypothesized that co-occurrence of all three
subsets was essential to the food-storage procedure that made possible multigroup winter
villages, winter ceremonials, etc., the distinctive features of ‘classic’ Northwest Coast culture of
ethnohistoric/ethnographic accounts. An ethnographic case, a Niska account of Ts’ets’aut
salmon fishery, and two historic events, impact of destruction of two (Tlingit) Kuiu and Hutsnuwu
villages, support the hypothesis. Archaeologic relevance of the model and its derived hypothesis
is demonstrated in the conclusion. (43)

This program is also intended to provide information about archaeological sites and districts.
The information available and legal status of the sites should be used to develop research

used is discussed in this paper. (4)

Dyson, Stephen L. (Wesleyan) PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES IN THE RECONSTRUCTION OF
ROMANO-ITALIAN SETTLEMENT HISTORY Roman history presents a good example of a society
whose imperfectly preserved literary record has tended to distort and downgrade the use of ar-
chaeology as an independent social science tool. Only in the last 25 years have archaeologically
oriented settlement studies been undertaken by British, Canadian, and American groups. These
have forced a serious reevaluation of the history of Roman agriculture. They have also shown the
extent of regional variation and raised numerous methodological problems. There is. a need fora

Earle, Timothy (UCLA) THE CENTRALIZED ECONOMIES OF STRATIFIED SOCIETIES This paper
examines the evolution of the centralized economic systems characteristic of chiefdoms and ar-
chaic states. It will be shown that these centralized economies function both to maximize the
mobilization of resources to the political superstructure and to minimize fluctuations in sub-

: sistence resources available to the local dependent populations. Specific cases discussed in-
clude the Inca empire state and the advanced Hawaiian chiefdoms. Differences in the structure
and capacity of the economic systems are outlined. (21)

ANALYSIS OF TURQUOISE ARTIFACTS AND RAW MATERIALS FROM SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS
Turquoise beads have been recovered from six Mississippi period sites of the Caddo cultural
tradition in the trans-Mississippi South. One hypothesis, with some archaeological and docu-

mentary support. concerning the source of the beads suggests a Southwestern origin. An alterna-
tive hypothesis based upon geological evidence is also proposed. Trace elements analysis using
X-ray fluorescence was performed on the beads and on raw turquoise collected from three Arkan-
Sas locations. Results of the analysis were compared with data from Southwestern turquoise
sources. Preliminary results suggest the beads may have been made from turquoise of local
origin. (32)

Embree, Lester (Duquesne) THE NEW ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE NEW PHILOSOPHY OF
SCIENCE In contrast to the long-dominant logical empiricism, a new tendency in philosophy of
science emphasizes the history and sociology of scientific communities in the attempt to under-
stand how science is actually done. By virtue of its recency and size, the so-called new ar-
chaeology is perfect for such an approach: its literature can be mastered by one person, and vir-
tually all of its advocates are still alive and thus able to provide oral history. This paper is being
presented partly in order to assess the mood of the archaeological community to be investigated
in this way. The new philosophy of science and some of its results will be sketched, and then the
problems and approaches for a case study of the new archaeology will be presented, in the hope
for lively discussion. (79)
Emerson, Thomas E. and Patrick S. Willey (South Dakota) WARFARE AMONG 15TH CENTURY
AGRICULTURALISTS IN THE MISSOURI RIVER VALLEY OF SOUTH DAKOTA Recent Salvage ex-
cavations by the authors in the fortification ditch of the Initial Coalescent site of Crow Creek
(39BF 11) revealed the remains of from 200 to 300 men, women, and children. The bodies, which
had been thrown into the ditch, were partially disarticulated, many showing signs of scalping and
mutilation. With the new evidence available, it can be observed that warfare here in the A.D. 1400s
was on a large scale between peoples of different ethnic affiliations, included ritual mutilation,
and may have developed out of competition for limited resources. (32)

all of the work being done today is successful. Where do we go from here? What kinds of ques-
tions can now be asked? In this paper we try to anticipate what archaeological research will be
like in the twenty-first century—after the lithic technologist has done his “thing.” (42)

Ericson, Jonathon E. (Harvard) CALIFORNIA OBSIDIAN HYDRATION RATES 14 hydration rates of
California obsidian are presented. The results indicate that defining the source leads to a refine-
ment of the hydration rate. Although a set of chemical and physical factors that influence the
change in rates has been determined, it is not expected that this line of research will be par-
ticularly fruitful in defining worldwide hydration rates. The results of these studies indicate that
the hydration process does not fit a linear or experimental model; i.e., hydration is complex. It is
suggested that future research should concentrate on environmental variables. (7)
Evans, June (American) THE SITE-SPECIFIC LAB AND FIELD MANUAL: A GUIDE FOR THE
PERPLEXED A site-specific lab and field manual, produced jointly by lab and field staff, can
facilitate the functioning of an archaeological field lab as an interactive part of both the initial
research design and the field methodology of an archaeological project. The purposes of the
manual are to make explicit and to standardize site-specific lab and field methodologies and to
clarify staff roles and responsibilities in the project. An example of a site-specific lab and field
manual is one developed for the Upper Delaware Valley Early Man Project's Shawnee-Minisink
site, It demonstrates how a compilation of instructions, guidelines, and procedures such as
those for the computerized methodology used at the site can provide valuable direction for both
lab and field personne! and can serve as a teaching aid for field schools. (30)
Evans, Susan T. (Penn State) SETTLEMENT AND LAND USE IN THE LATE HORIZON
TEOTIHUACAN VALLEY The Late Horizon (A. D. 1350 to 1521) in Mesoamerica marked a return of
political hegemony to the Valley of Mexico, where a dense, circumscribed population was
distributed among distinct polities, based on territorial, segmentarily organized ethnic enclaves.
This paper presents a structural analysis of the interaction of environment, settlement pattern,
land-use Strategy, and political relations of the Teotinuacan Valley subsystem to investigate the
etnnohistorically documented trend toward marked differentiation of access to key resources, as
the peasant population is distributed over the most marginal agricultural land and elites secure
access to the most productive areas. (9)

Feinman, Gary (Arizona State) CHANGES IN THE ORGANIZATION OF CERAMIC PRODUCTION
IN PRE-HISPANIG OAXACA, MEXICO. Recent interpretation of the settlement pattern data col-
lected by the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project has suggested that the political
organization of the region changed markedly during the pre-Hispanic period. A diachronic study
of the relationship of settlement locations to land-use zones has suggested that the loca! ex-
change system underwent significant changes as well. Several lines of analysis have also Sug-
gested that the organization of ceramic production within pre-Hispanic Oaxaca changed through
time. An interpretive model that relates the changing organization of pre-Hispanic ceramic pro-
duction to changes in the political and economic networks will be proposed and evaluated. (5)

Mexico. With the support of various groups, including the Navajo Nation, the Pueblo of Zuni suc-
cessfully initiated action to block the sale of this body and to ensure that it was properly dis-

> posed of by reburial. The development of legal theory, the process of invoking relevant state laws,
and the final disposition of the body are discussed. The utility of this action as a precedent for
cultural resource management and its implications for the archaeological profession are con-
sidered. (8)

Fernstrom, Katharine (Southern Illinois) THE EFFECT OF SUBSISTENCE STRESS ON EXCHANGE
NETWORKS Exchange networks are viewed as dynamic systems that are affected, in a predic-

exchange networks. It is posited that in a period of subsistence stress, systemic reorganization
will be reflected in a significant decrease in nonlocal lithic materials found on sites. (38)

REPORT AND PRELIMINARY CONCLUSIONS A comprehensive two-year survey of northern
Labrador between Okak and Hudson Strait was completed successfully in 1978. This research,
building on work farther south, considerably expands information on such questions as culture
history and ethnic identity, prehistoric populations, boundaries, cultural relationships, and en-

‘ vironmental considerations. Highlights from the 1978 field season are presented together with
preliminary conclusions from research to date. The use of these data for approaching problems
of Eastern Arctic and Subartic archaeology is considered and the relative merits of scale in re-
search of this type. (35)

clear than originally thought. (43)

systems analysis of the hafted lithic artifacts from the Hoko River wet site. This method of
analysis is particularly applicable to wet or frozen site conditions where several subsystems of
one lithic system may be preserved. Replicative systems analysis involves replicating tne entire
technological lithic system from the selection of raw materials, reduction of raw material into
preconceived tools, hafting of selected tools through functions of the hafted tools. Aboriginal ar-
tifacts are employed as experimental controls. This specific technological system has been
named the “Hoko Systemic Bipolar Microlith Technology." (37)

Site the Lachane site GbTo-33 at Prince Rupert B. C. were examined. Analyses and a comparison
of the biodeterioration and from physical and chemical characteristics of the woods are
presented. The analyses suggest (1) that it is possible to separate woods that are site con- ‘

suggests differences due to the different burial environments.(37)

Foley, Robert (Durham, Great Britain) A REGIONAL APPROAGH TO THE STRUCTURE OF AR-
CHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS The traditional archaeological bias towards sites as the ap-
propriate frame for sampling and study has continued to manifest itself even within relatively
sophisticated spatial studies and approaches to prehistoric energy capture systems. This bias ef-
fectively excludes from consideration a vast realm of behavioral information relevant to the very
issues addressed in such studies. Recently, however, a number of archaeologists have turned
their attention to so-called off-site or non-site archaeology. This paper seeks to outline the types
of information implicit in artifact distributions not normally viewed as “sites” by the ar-
chaeologists. A behaviorally based model for the regional structuring of archaeological material
will be presented.(33)

Ford, Richard |. (Michigan) STORAGE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL GOLLECTIONS Many ar-
chaeologists regard storage facilities as garbage compactors: as long as the modules are the
same, it does not matter what goes in them. In fact, archaeological evidence is quite .
heterogeneous, and storage facilities should reflect this variability. Similarly, accessibility to
Stored collections is time dependent: some are used daily, others occasionally, and a few rarely.
By planning in advance for how a collection will be used and under what circumstances, ap-
propriate storage areas and facilities can be built or reorganized with a considerable saving of
staff time and money for curation. (31) *

Francis, Julie E. (Arizona State) THE USE OF LOG-LINEAR MODELS AS AN ANALYTIC TECH-
NIQUE FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA Although the Chi-square test for independence is prob-
ably one of the statistical tests most widely used by archaeologists, relatively little attention has
been directed toward a series of more useful analytic techniques that elaborate upon the Chi-
square test—log-linear models. Log-linear models can be used to analyze associations between
two or more multistate, nominally scaled variables. An outline of the technique is presented, in-
cluding assumptions, models, and test statistics. Log-linear techniques are used in a functional
analysis of chipped stone artifacts from a small habitation site in central Arizona. The utility of
log-linear methods to archaeological data is evaluated. (12)
Freeman, Leslie G. (Chicago) RESEARCH ON EARLIER MAGDALENIAN LIFEWAYS IN CAN-
TABRIAN SPAIN Excavations were begun at the Cantabrian cave site of “el Juyo"” in 1978, to
determine whether suggestions of an earlier Magdalenian shift in subsistence strategies and
related activities provided by earlier excavations there and elsewhere in Cantabria could be
proved or disproved. The top four Magdalenian li! levels in the deep stratigraphy have now been
sampled. In addition to large faunal and artifact collections, the top two levels contained hearths
and large dugout structure complexes. The three top levels differ in faunal and artifact represen-
tation, and clear differences in the spatial distribution of recovered materials are also evident.
The fourth is a true shell midden. This work is clarifying the original problems posed, and com-
parison of data from this and other sites will permit eventual placement of e! Juyo’s horizons in
an overall picture of regional Magdalenian subsistence/settlement strategies. (23)

a floodplain setting offer one of the most complex environments for understanding the contexts
of archaeological materials. Interpretation of surface and buried artifacts in such a setting must
consider the evidence for geomorphic change in the floodplain in general and at a site in specific.
This is illustrated by examination of an area of the Mississippi floodplain in the vicinity of East
St. Louisswhere (1) Archaic materials may be found on the present surface and in buried contexts,
while C'* dates in this time range derive from up to 60’ below the present surface, and (2) Archaic
material is found in deposits stratigraphically above Woodland and Mississippian contexts,
Resolution of such apparent conflicts is best served by the collaboration of the geomorphologist

site analyses tend to be unidimensional, with emphasis on status distinctions. Explanations for |
differentiations are seldom determined. A shift toward a multi-dimensional framework using
polythetic definitions is necessary. This is most easily accomplished by using space as the
organizing principle. Various spatial-analytic techniques are critiqued, and one that is more ap-
propriate for mortuary analysis is presented. Several levels of spatial analysis are needed, each
of which represents a different level of relationships. Using Mississippian as an example, the ap-

similar kinds of tasks were performed in all components but with different frequencies. (1)

Gordon, Claire C. and Jane E. Buikstra (Northwestern) SOIL PH, BONE PRESERVATION, AND

ingly important in the scientific investigation of cultural and biocultural interactions and change,
sampling errors at these sites have become a primary concern. Though acidic soil is frequently
cited as a major contributor to sampling bias through poor preservation of inhumed remains, few
if any researchers have attempted to quantify this relationship for predictive purposes. It is sug-
gested here that a pH-preservation relationship can be quantified and should be used by re-
searchers in choosing mortuary sites that, if properly excavated, will yield a maximum of skeletal

between social and technological dimensions of industry through use of an analytic framework
that is also applicable to similar study of extinct protoindustrial craft organizations. The frame-

Gorski, Linda A. (Missouri-Columbia) MICROSTRATIGRAPHY AT THE CARLSTON ANNIS SITE
Some archaeologists have assumed that shell middens have no stratification because dif-
ferences in soil color and texture are not apparent. Although the soil matrix may be undifferen-
tiated, the objects in it—shells, rocks, artifacts, and other materials—were not deposited
simultaneously. In such a case, the stratification must be inferred from the deposition of the ob-
jects themselves. Pressurized water, misted over the profiles, heightens color and textural
distinctions and clarifies the depositional angle of objects. Detailed drawings of objects in the
profiles delineate the major stratigraphic layers within the midden, and a depositional sequence
can be hypothesized. (16)
Grabert, Garland F. PEBBLE TOOLS AND TIME FACTORING Pebbie tool assemblages have for
many years been one of the more puzzling lithic groups in the Pacific Northwest. They have been
viewed as Chronological markers, as indicators of task-specific sites, and as remains of distinct
cultural entities. They sometimes seem to be the only visible part of certain regional site com-
ponents. A variety of lithic tools often accompany the pebble tool complex. Assemblages of both
kinds have been recorded and examined by the writer in both littoral and upland sites. Pebble
tools need not be chronological markers. While coastline changes may have occurred in post-
glacial times, several of these sites have always been within a few hundred meters of a coast
though the elevations above sea level have changed. Experiments are under way to determine
43

trolled before temporal factors can be expressed. (34)

STANDING ARCHEOLOGICAL SITE FORMATION: A SIMULATION APPROACH. Recently ar-

associations between ethnohistoric or ethnographic statements or direct observations of
behavior and their material by-products. The behavioral associations are assumed to be capable
of explaining archaeological observations. However, without a theoretical foundation linking the
particular and the general, these particular observations cannot be used to interpret prehistoric
remains. Instead, by developing explicit theoretical models relating behavior to site formation,
expected archaeological outcomes can be simulated. These outcomes are controlled experimen- -
tal data sets that can, by comparing the expected and the observed, provide information about a
prehistoric site’s activities. (2)

spite of the fact that both the spirit and the letter of the law were to protect sites from vandals. Re-
cent legislation permitting large sums of money to be spent on archaeological investigations has
produced good archaeology. But it has also permitted many nonscientific, mechanical investiga-
tions as well as very expensive, narrowly Conceived research programs, neither of which is in the
spirit of the legislation. Clearly the ethical dilemma has to be resolved by bringing the letter and
the spirit of the pertinent legislation together. (17)

the population. Simulations are used to compare the alternative operation of optimizing and
satisficing decision criteria as determiners of standards of living and population regulation in

may operate in mixed-goal decision making to determine rates of population change given

that may buffer populations from resource shortages in homeostatic population regulation. (20)

late Holocene archaeologic sites in the Southern Plains have resulted in dated pollen diagrams
from only three sites, all in northeastern Oklahoma. The pollen record from these sites, represen-
ting the time interval A.D. 300 to 1250, indicates an oak forest vegetation such as exists at these
localities today. Increased hickory pollen frequencies during the period A.D. 400 to 1050, with
maximum hickory abundance occurring about A.D. 600, may reflect a period of more moist
climate. The decline of hickory beginning A.D. 600 shows a return to drier conditions, a climatic
trend that may have persisted to the present. Dated pollen records from both archaeologic and
nonarchaeologic sites in the Southern Plains are essentially absent for the time periods A.D. 1300

, nature of subsistence activities at a portion of the Crescent Beach midden dating A.D. 600-1500.
Given the nature of the local environment and ethnographic subsistence patterns, it is possible to
predict the types of cultural debris expected from subsistence activities at different seasons. A
wide area excavation isolated 31 stratigraphic layers, seasonal groups of layers exhibiting
marked differences in types of cultural remains and hence inferred subsistence activities. The
isolation of depositional units and determination of accurate seasonality dates from clam growth
rings facilitated reconstruction of archaeological subsistence patterns and predictions about the
nature of subsistence patterns of earlier periods. (24)

Hatch, James W. (Penn State) STATUS-SPECIFIC NUTRITIONAL STRESS IN A MISSISSIPPIAN
CHIEFDOM The examination of a burial population from the Dallas phase, a series of Mississip-
pian period chiefdoms from eastern Tennessee, has revealed significant individual variation ina
spatially and temporally sensitive network of social status relationships.

Given this organizational backdrop, three dimensions of physical variation are examined for
each status category: status, growth arrest (Harris) lines, and certain trace elements (through
neutron activation). Hypotheses will be tested regarding possible status-specilic vectors of nutri-
tional stress, comparing the results with existing models of chiefdom-level economics that em-
phasize chiefly altruism or deprivation in the community-wide circulation of foods. (13)

Hauck, F. Richard (Archeological-Environmental Research Corp.) ESSENTIALS AND POTENTIAL
OF THE RESEARCH-ORIENTED INDEPENDENT ARCHEOLOGICAL FIRM Private archaeological
research firms are often stereotyped as being small project-oriented, uninterested in pursuing
research objectives, and primarily motivated by financial opportunism. In certain instances, this
identification has been correct. The private corporation can develop research capability and can
initiate specific research designs. The archaeological data and funds needed for such an orienta-
tion can be obtained through industrial consulting and government contractual projects with
careful planning. The purpose of this paper is to identify the methods that permit the private insti-
tution the latitude for conducting the complete range of archaeological research without loss of
its inherent commitment to industry. (4)

, Hayden, Brian (Simon Fraser) INTERACTION THEORY: ANOTHER MISSING LINK Given that the
development of interaction theory is essential for adequate interpretation of behavioral pattern-
ing in archaeological remains, a framework for the development of interaction theory is pre-
sented within the context of ethnoarchaeological research conducted in the Mayan Highlands.
Principal distinctions include interactions between vs. within communities, varying reasons for
interacting, and varying types of interaction. Intercommunity interactions can be characterized
usefully according to community types, and a kinship-free analysis of interaction within commu-
nities is explored. (26)
Hediund, Gerald C. (Green River) LITHIC MATERIALS FROM INLAND CULTURAL SITES ON THE
ENUMCLAW PLATEAU IN WESTERN WASHINGTON Five sites have been excavated, tested, and
systematically surface collected on the Enumciaw Plateau. Numerous artifacts and chipping
detritus have been found and studied. The most common functional class of artifacts found were
utilized flakes. Other tools, such as scrapers, points, cobble-core choppers, edge-ground cobbles,
perforators, burins, and gravers, were also common. The number of burins and gravers may in-
dicate the use of bone and wood industries that have not been preserved. A variety of techniques
were used to make these tools, including the Levallois Core method, microblade cores, and poly-
hedral blade cores. (42)

determinants of the aggregation pattern are also discussed. (8)
Henry, Donald O. (Tulsa) QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS OF A LITHIC REDUCTION SEQUENCE The ap-
plication of quantitative observations to a lithic reduction sequence enables the lithic analyst to
define the parameters of reduction stages precisely and to identify curation modes accurately. A
fundamental advantage of a quantitative approach to lithic reduction over the traditional use of
qualitative attributes (cortical elements, noncortical elements, etc.) is in being able to measure
levels of core and biface exhaustion. (38)
Henry, Kathleen Cooper (Oklahoma) THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENTIAL RECOVERY STRATEGIES
ON CHIPPED STONE ASSEMBLAGES Experimental data indicate dramatically different interpre-
tations of faunal and botanical assemblages resulting from the use of recovery strategies utiliz-
ing fine-screen mesh. It has been shown that the use of fine-screen mesh affects the recovery
precision of archaeological materials, but the impact of fine-screen recovery on lithic technolog-
ical interpretations has not been considered. It is important that lithic analyses reflect the propor-
tional distribution of elements within a site. Assemblages obtained through 6-mm and 4-mm
meshes do not reflect this distribution. Therefore, a sampling strategy utilizing 1-mm mesh
should be employed in excavations utilizing larger meshes to obtain an assemblage from which
valid inferences can be made. (38)
Hett, Charles E. S. (Canadian Conservation Institute) PLANNING A FROZEN SITE EXCAVATION:
A CONSERVATOR’S VIEWPOINT This paper outlines the benefits of considering the conserva-
tion of artifacts before excavating frozen sites and the advantages of including an archaeological
conservator at the stage of a preliminary survey before undertaking any sizable project at a frozen
site. Planning for the provisions of adequate housing of recovered artifacts immediately upon ar-
rival at their destination is shown to be a possible anc essential part of their preparation for
fieldwork. Some practical recommendations are made tor the packing and labeling of organic
materials in the field. (37)

Hodder, lan (Cambridge) REFUSE AND MODELS OF WITHIN-SITE SPATIAL PATTERNS Recent .
work on the patterning of artifacts within settlements has concentrated on the behavioral and ac- A
tivity factors that cause variation in such distributions. But refuse disposal can only be fully
understood by reference to the mental structures that impose an order on the outside world. This
is shown by ethnoarchaeological examples in Britain, Zambia, and Sudan, and the application of |
structural models to archaeological site data from the British Iron Age is demonstrated. (49)

,
, fishhooks from the Hoko River wet site (45CA213) represent the oldest assemblage of perishable |
fishhooks found on the Northwest Coast. For a better understanding of the function of these

fishhooks, experiments were conducted in their replication, Guided by Makah Indian elders, they

were then used to fish for halibut and other bottom fish at traditional fishing beds. Consequently,

through the use of archaeological and ethnological data, specifically the direct information

gained from both the replications and the experience of Indian fishermen, a greater insight was

achieved in the technological as well as the cultural aspects of these fishhooks. (37)

Hoffman, Michael P. (Arkansas-Fayetteville) CHANGING MORTUARY PATTERNS IN THE LITTLE

RIVER REGION, ARKANSAS Mortuary variation between A. D. 800 and 1450 in the Little River

region, Arkansas, based on a sample of over 200 burials and five archaeological phases, is
documented and explained. It is postulated that the importance of individual sites in settlement

hierarchies and social ranking of individuals account for much of the mortuary variation, By the

Mineral Springs phase, the Caddoan culture possesses several attributes defined as ar-
chaeological correlates of chiefdoms by Peebles and Kus. The changes in Caddoan
sociopolitical organization observed by Brown in the Arkansas River appear to be paralleled in

the Little River region. (32)

Holley, Gerald A. (Washington) MICROWEAR: AN OBSERVATION OF SCALE Microwear studies

are becoming a major method for the investigation of use-wear patterns on lithic artifacts. Major
assumptions of many who use this method include (1) the utilization of smaller and smalier

scales of observation allows for the observation of an increasing amount of information concern-

ing use-wear, and (2) the greater evidence observed allows greater precision concerning spatial
relationships between worn objects. A lithic assemblage was examined macroscopically and at

| varying microscopic levels in order to determine the validity of these assumptions. (42)

they can be classified according to their primary functions within the framework of Aztec military

policy. Various Relaciones Geograficas also reveal the nature of local supply relationships be- |
tween the garrisons and towns in their immediate vicinity. The nature of the Codice Mendoza gar-

Holtzman, Richard C. (Minnesota Geological Survey) MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD ESTIMATES OF .
RELATIVE ABUNDANCE IN VERTEBRATE FOSSIL ASSEMBLAGES The major methods of

estimating the relative abundance of species in vertebrate fossil assemblages are maximum

likelihood estimates. They differ from one another in their inherent assumptions about the
assemblage and its relation to the sample being analyzed. Monte Carlo simulations suggest that

in most cases estimates based on weighted abundance of elements provide greater accuracy than

estimates based on minimum number of individuals. A consideration of these assumptions and

quantitative errors pinpoints areas of needed research that could greatly improve the accuracy of
relative abundance estimates as applied to fossil vertebrates. (25) |
Hurley, William M. (Toronto) and Masakazu Yoshizaki (Hokkaido) RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

THE YAG! AND HAMANASUNO SITE Two Early Jomon sites located on the Oshima Peninsula of
Southwestern Hokkaido have been subjected to long-term salvage (Hamanasuno) and the begin-

ning of a three-year research (Yagi) program. The two sites are 4 km distant from one another and .
are Situated on similar terraces. Yagi is the earliest, dating from ca. 5000 to 4000 B. C., and
Hamanasuno dates from 4100 to 3100 B. C. These two large Neolithic villages exhibit unexpected-

ly complex settlement patterns, ceramic continuity, and similar environmental adaptations in an

area previously suggested as too severe for any pattern other than simple hunting and gathering
communities. (36)

of seismic lines provide a sampling of various biotic communities in a narrow transect similar to

linear transect techniques used in research-oriented surveys. Seismic line surveys in

FROZEN HISTORIC SITE IN THE CANADIAN HIGH ARCTIC In 1853 a British naval search and
rescue expedition constructed a stone storehouse off the coast of Melville Island, Northwest Ter-
ritories, Canada. This storehouse was stocked with a complete inventory of provisions and sup:
plies used in mid-19th-century Arctic exploration, many of which survive to this day in remarkable
condition, because of the High Arctic climate. The history of the site and the interdisciplinary

Jennings, Calvin H. (Colorado State) PROTON MAGNETOMETER APPLICATIONS IN OPEN
HUNTER-GATHERER SITES Proton magnetometers have been employed with acceptable results
in the survey of open campsites in Northwestern Colorado. The procedure requires the use of two
sensing stations, which are triggered simultaneously. Data can be hand analyzed in the field.
Automated data processing is recommended, however, because of the ease with which graphic
aids to interpretation of anomaly signatures can be produced, The success of the application is
in part the result of the low magnetic noise environment in which the surveys are made. (38)
Jewett, Roberta A. (Arizona State) THE EFFECT OF DROUGHT ON PREHISTORIC AGRICUL-
TURAL POPULATIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST: AN OVERVIEW Arid regions are typically "
precarious environments for practicing agriculture. Modern preindustrial and ethnohistoric
agricultural populations have varied in their perception of and adjustment to drought conditions.
This variation is examined in an attempt to develop models for prehistoric agricultural adjust-
ment to similar precarious environmental conditions. Principal components of the models are
variation in perception due to drought duration and timing and differential labor allocation for
agricultural pursuits, demographic factors, and environmental variation. (48)

base for an examination of the use of space at a Postclassic ceremonial center in the Southern
Maya Lowlands. Comparison with contemporaneous sites shows similarities in both architecture
and site plan. Intrasite analysis is based on a series of metric variables that allow the formulation
and testing of specific hypotheses about spatial organizations. Conclusions dealing with
building function and social stratification are drawn from the analysis. (46)

PROJECTILE POINTS FROM THE SOUTHERN GRAND CANYON REGION A recent ar-
chaeological reconnaissance of the Tusayan Ranger District of the Kaibab National Forest in
northem Arizona produced a large number of projectile points. Attempts have been made to
classify these points using groups with known Anasazi, Cohonina, and Archaic affiliations. The
integrity of the groups with known association was initially tested using discriminate analysis.
With proper group identity, artifacts that were found in isolation are classified using the discrimi-
nant functions. The final analysis focuses on the distributional patterns associated with the pro-
jectile points. (41)
Judge, W. James (National Park Service) MINIMUM IMPACT SURVEY IN A MANAGEMENT CON-
TEXT Modern archaeologists are faced with an inherent conflict between professional research
demands on the one hand and managerial demands on the other. Professional research usually
involves the destruction of at least some portion of the archaeological data base. Managerial
demands emphasize, at least ideally, the conservation of that same data base. Whether all ar-
chaeologists feel this potential conflict equally at the moment is immaterial—it is indeed real
and will not diminish with time. The concept of ‘minimal impact survey” provides an excellent
opportunity to examine this conflict in some detail, to isolate some of the problems involved, and
to suggest possible solutions. This paper attempts to do this by reviewing noncollective ar-
chaeological survey as a minimal impact technique and examining both its potential and its
limitations from the empirical and theoretical standpoints. (17)

, project in the Choke Canyon area of southern Texas provide the basis for this paper. Analyses in-
dicate only slight changes in adaptation during a several-thousand-year period. Cultural
materials are remarkably homogeneous throughout the reservoir area despite significant
microenvironmental differences, Subsistence activities were centered on the exploitation of
vegetal resources, which were supplemented primarily by terrestrial mammals and aquatic
resources. Settlement patterns are explained using a model that incorporates seasonal availabili-
ty of food resources and hydrological data. The paper also examines the cognitive processes
underlying the model. (40)
Justen, Anne B. (Tulsa) MICROWEAR PATTERNS ON BIFACES The class “biface” includes con-
siderable morphological and inferred functional variability. This microwear study was designed
to address the problems of functional and morphological correlations in the class and to deter-
mine the point in the reduction sequence where bifaces came to be used as tools. A large number
of bifaces from sites within the Hog Creek Valley, Central Texas, were selected for study using a
Bausch and Lomb stereoscopic microscope with a precision microphotographic apparatus. A
scheme for classificaiton and interpretation of edge damage was devised, and the microwear at-

of ancient Mesopotamian Ubaid and related ceramics using polished thin section petrography,
electron microprobe, X-ray diffraction, and SEM methods have identified site mineral
assemblages, levels of technology, and in turn trade patterns, chronological development of
ceramic methods, and technological communication by itinerant potters. Each of the many
analytical methods now available can produce information, but no single technique can result in
a complete picture. An understanding of the strengths and limitations of each method is
necessary in devising the best combination for a specific problem. (22)
Kamp, Kathryn A. (University of Arizona) ETHNICITY IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD The ar-
chaeological methods currently utilized for delineating ethnic groups are discussed, and the
literature on the subject is critically evaluated. Previous attempts to discern ethnic groups are
deemed particularly inappropriate for the analysis of complex societies, because they make im-
plicit or explicit assumptions about the predominance of home manufacture, the spatial contigui-
ty of utilized areas, and the insignificance of intergroup variation in either wealth or sub-
sistence/residence strategies. A new perspective, based on behaviors probabilistically
associated with ethnic group membership, is described, and a research strategy that combines
ethnoarchaeology, tradtional archaeological analysis, and the examination of pertinent historic
Near Eastern texts is presented. (38)

Kent, Susan (Washington State) THE USE AND REFUSE OF ACTIVITY AREAS: SPATIAL
PATTERNING THROUGH TIME AND SPACE Specific assumptions utilized by anthropologists
concerning the use of space were assessed through ethnoarchaeological research. Navajo
spatial patterning was observed and contrasted with reconstructions of recent Navajo ar-
chaeological sites. The influence of culture, socioeconomic status, and residence (rural versus
urban) on spatial patterning was examined by reference to cross-cultural ethnographic data. In-
teresting results from the preliminary analysis suggest that many loci identified as work areas at
archaeological sites may instead have been storage areas. In addition, the analysis revealed the
important role dogs have in creating apparent activity areas. (12)

ETHICS AND OBLIGATIONS Although a curator's chief professional concern may be with his or

ble management of museum collections and accompanying ethical standards has become ob-
vious in recent years. It is significant that the membership of the American Association of
51
, Museums made professional standards their first priority in a Survey of future objectives. The
curator of archaeological collections has potential ethical problems in a number of areas, in-
cluding maintenance, acquisition and disposal, availability, disposition of human remains, and
ownership and publication of scholarly material. (31)
King, Thomas J., dr. (Bureau of Reclamation) A PARTIAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF
SAGUARO MONUMENT (EAST), ARIZONA An archaeological survey of 31 km of proposed horse
trails in Saguaro National Monument (East), Arizona, has been completed for the National Park
Service. The survey located 62 new archaeological sites. Two new Cochise culture sites, one AMI,
two AMIl sites, and numerous ceramic era sites were identified. Ceramics recorded ranged from
an incised Snaketown red-on-gray, Pioneer period (A. D. 300-500) sherd to proto-historic Papago
Red and Sobaipuri sherds. Ceramic data suggest the survey area was most heavily occupied in
the Sedentary period (A. D. 900-1200). Lithic remains indicate notable quarrying, large flake pro-
duction, and tool-making localities. Economic activities and three potential settlement pattern
scenarios are discussed. (8)
Kirby, Foster E. (Tulsa) GASTROPOD EVIDENCE FOR LATE HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTS IN
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS Aquatic and terrestrial gastropods have been recovered in the
thousands from archaeological sites in the Hog Creek Valley, central Texas. These were analyzed
to species level with habitat extrapolated based on current collections. Detailed radiocarbon
determinations have allowed a tight chronology to be developed with the change to more mesic
conditions beginning about A. D. 600, when an increase in tree-cover density is hypothesized.
Data from the northern section of the Southern Plains indicate that the shift in this area was
toward more xeric conditions. Several synchronic climatic expressions are likely to have oc-
curred throughout the Southern Plains. (50)
Klein, Richard G. (Chicago) DERIVATION AND INTERPRETATION OF AGE PROFILES FOR HYP-
SODONT UNGULATES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL FAUNAL SAMPLES The simplest and most
economical method of establishing age profiles in osteological samples of hypsodont ungulates
is probably the measurement of crown heights. In combination with demographic and behavioral
data available on various extant ungulate species, crown-height-based age profiles of several
species as represented in one European and two African Paleolithic sites suggest that the oc-
cupants of the sites generally stalked individuals of some species but regularly captured whole
groups in others. In combination with knowledge of the relative abundance of various species in
the sites and their probable relative abundance on the hoof, the age profiles also suggest that the
particular hunters involved took very few individuals from the populations of large ungulates they
hunted. (25)

caused significant changes in what had been a primarily historical discipline. Archaeologists
began to look upon themselves increasingly as “scientists,” consistent with the objectives of
isolating variability in the archaeological record and attempting scientific explanation. Can we
trace the spread of these ideas in the academic community? This paper attempts a content
analysis of abstracts of papers delivered at the 1963, 1968, 1973, and 1978 meetings of the Socie-
ty for American Archaeology. The results are placed in the framework of changing archaeological
goals and their relevance to holistic anthropology. (19)

processes. The Contextual Analysis Project at Cuello was intended to gather information that,
combined with conventional stratigraphic analysis, can be used to better answer questions con-
cerning the genesis and tater disturbance of archaeological deposits. The densities and sizes of
artifactual, floral, molluscan, and faunal remains were measured. In addition, artifacts were ex-
amined for degree of wear and abrasion. Some preliminary results from the analysis of these data
are presented. (10)
Kraft, Jonn C. (Delaware) GEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF COASTAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SETTINGS
The application of some basic geological techniques to the study of coastal change may be used
to form paleogeographic reconstructions of archaeological sites. Throughout the Holocene
52
_
, Epoch (past 10,000 years), ongoing geological change of coastal environments has greatly af-
fected man's occupancy of the coastal zone. Paleogeographic studies are useful in interpreting
the reasons for location of archaeological sites that now seem “out of place” with their present
geography. (77)

Kukan, Gerald J. (Toronto) PROGRESS AND VARIABILITY IN TOOL DESIGN DURING THE OLD
WORLD PALEOLITHIC The theory presented in this paper provides an understanding of certain
aspects of formal variation in lithic artifacts. This theory explains how lithic tools or tool com-
ponents were designed or structured to magnify human or hominid muscular force in task ac-
tivities. Techniques of tool design are perceived to have become increasingly efficient during the
Paleolithic. Technological “progress” is manifested in design innovations pertaining to
miniaturization, standardization, improvement in prehensile surface design, and longevity of
tools or tool components. (2)

Kus, Susan M. (Michigan) ARCHAEOLOGY AND SYMBOLIC PRODUCTION As a conceptual tool,
the notion of “mode of production,’ which encompasses not only “forces of production” but also
“relations of production,” has salvaged things cultural from an impoverished material deter-
minism. As a result the theoretical burden is now placed on the definition of the “relations of pro-
duction.” To consider the “relations of production" simply as social rules of production, distribu-
tion, and consumption of goods and information while ignoring their representational aspect
within a cultural system of meaning perpetuates a layer-cake model of culture. It leaves
“ideological” matters as superstructural residue, reflected in, though not critical to, the creation
of the archaeological record. The ideational aspects of the “mode of production” are discussed
in relation to their “visibility” in the archaeological record. (12)

Lamp, Frederick J. (Yale) SAHAGUN RECONSTRUCTED: A LEGEND OF FIVE SUNS The Historia
general de jas cosas de Nueva Espana by Fray Bernardino de Sahagun strangely appears to pre-
sent no “Legend of the Suns,” so prominent in contemporary sources. This paper is concerned
chiefly with Chapter 29 of Book X, where a history of Mexican migrations ostensibly is given. The
structure of key passages suggests that the entire account was recited originally as a standard
oral tradition in the form of dyadic verse. Through reconstruction of the account, a series of five
eras emerges with time sequences, presiding deities, color symbolism, and cardinal orientation
corresponding to other versions of the “Legend of the Suns.” (46)

Latta, Martha A. (Scarborough College, Toronto) A CERAMIC PARADIGM: DECORATIVE MOTIFS
IN THE ONTARIO IROQUOIS TRADITION Studies of Iroquoian ceramics have traditionally used

decorative attributes as primary indicators of chronological and social variables within the tradi-
tion. Attempts to systematize the notation of these attributes have been hampered by underlying
theoretical inconsistencies influencing the communication of data and the comparability of
analyses. This paper presents a paradigm based on the act of creating the motif rather than on
the motif itself. By focusing on the sequential decision structure inherent in the production of a
given motif, we may isolate levels of choices, mutually exclusive or inclusive attributes, and
aspects of design modification that contributed to the creation of the finished decorative motif.

occupied the upper Rio Grijalva basin at the time of the Spanish Conquest, are now almost ex-
tinct. Their identification and study have been carried out by ethnohistorical, archaeological,
linguistical, osteological, and ethnoarchaeological methods. The demise of this group can be
traced directly to an acculturation process in three phases: Conquest, Suncretic, and Necrotic.
This process is a direct consequence of the Coxoh conquest, subjugation, infection, and ex-

However they differ in architectural style and village layout. The postulated presence of two
distinct cultural groups in the area, Mogollon to the east of Clear Creek Canyon and Sinagua to
the west, may account for these observed differences. The role of natural boundaries in determin-
ing patterns of settlement and interaction between groups is investigated. Preliminary results in-

Belize, analyzes chipped stone recovered from Preciassic house floors and contemporaneous ex-
terior surfaces corresponding to “household clusters.”” Because Cerro Maya has been described
by Freidel as a trading port, inspection of lithic tools and debris attempts to identify “tool kits”
used in the manufacture of (1) wooden objects (which would include canoes important for coastal
trade), (2) rough fibers (e.g., for ropes), and (3) possible exports, such as worked shell. The distribu-
tion of production at the site is examined for implications about social organization. (14)
Lewis Johnson, L. (Vassar) MANUFACTURING SEQUENCES VS. STONE TOOL USE: AN EVALUA-
TION OF PROSPECTIVE SUCCESS IN PREHISTORIC INTERPRETATION Studies of stone tool
manufacture and use have increased markedly in the last few years. An examination of the
results of these studies indicates that the former enjoy a greater degree of success than the latter
and that experimental manufacture has had considerably higher predictive value than experimen-
tal use. It is argued that this difference is due to the complexity of variables involved in relating
experimental results to the archaeological record and that, therefore, use studies cannot, except
under extraordinary conditions of preservation of archaeological materials, attain the surety of
manufacturing studies. (42)

, settlement system composed of one large central site and several small outlying settlements is
viewed as one response to local inconsistencies in the yields of domestic and wild resources. To
evaluate whether a cluster of large/small sites functioned as a subsistence/settlement system, a
design analysis on black-on-white ceramics is undertaken. (21)

Liman, Florence F. (St. Louis) A MAYA BALL GAME VASE A polychrome Maya vase in the St.
Louis Art Museum is one of the few depicting the playing of the ball game. Stylistically it is not
related to any vase of comparable subject matter, but to one concerned with a scene of human
sacrifice. The correspondences indicate that both were done by the same artist or workshop,
although the provenance of one is given as Belize and of the other as Bonampak. This paper will
consider the pictorial decoration, the glyphic inscriptions, and the ceramic pots themselves as
evidence for this conclusion. (22)
Limp, W. Frederick (F.1.A.) RESOURCES AND RATIONALITY: ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC
ANALOGUES A basic anthropological question is the nature of the articulation between
biophysical and cultural systems. Of particular interest are the specific processes involved in the
relationships between resource distributions and the location of prehistoric activities. An ex-
amination of these relationships is conducted using an axiomatic choice theory framework. The
basic characteristics of axiomatic choice theory are discussed along with a computer-based
operationalization of the theory. The results of application of the theory and method to
prehistoric activity distributions in a portion of the Ohio River Valley are discussed. (21)
Lincoln, Charlies Edward (Tulane) THE STRUCTURE OF MAYOID SOCIETY, BASED ON EXCAVA-
TIONS AT TRAVESIA. Recent excavations at Travesia in Honduras explored the architecture of
the site. The results are described and compared with other Ulua-Yojoa sites. It is suggested that
Travesia was the central integration point for a large sociopolitical and economic unit that en-
compassed the entire Ulua-Yojoa culture area. This suggestion is evaluated and examined in
light of presently available data about the Ulua-Yojoa or “Mayoid” culture. Architectural evidence
is used as the primary basis for comparison and inference. (46)
Lindsay, Alexander J. (Museum of Northern Arizona) and Glenna Williams-Dean (Boston) AN
EVALUATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTIONS MANAGEMENT PRACTICES In 1978 an
American Anthropological Association project assessed the present state of curation of federally
owned archaeological collections. Federal laws, regulations, and collection management objec-
tives were reviewed, and a field study was made of 20 institutions to assess curation practices
and the physical state of the archaeological collections. Recommendations and guideline
Statements to assist in the achievement of adequate curation of archaeological data have been
proposed and will be discussed. (31)

Longacre, William A. (Arizona) KALINGA POTTERY, AN ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDY
Assumed sources of stylistic variability in pottery have been used by archaeologists to make in-
ferences about the organization and behavior of extinct societies. To assess the validity of these
assumptions, 12 months of fieldwork were conducted among the Kalinga of northern Luzon,
Philippines. Kinship and learning frameworks among the potters and participation in work groups
were studied, and a collection of nearly 300 vessels from a controlled sample of potters was
made. Stylistic variation in Kalinga pottery is more complex than expected, It is related not only
to the learning frameworks but also to work group participation and season of production. (22)
Lorenz, Thomas H. (Washington) TURNER OVERLOOK FAUNA An arctic fauna collected during
July 1978 by archaeologists from the Alaskan Fish and Wildlife Service is characterized and ex-
amined by SPSS and SYMAP techniques. This Eskimo caribou harvest locality was apparently oc-
cupied seasonally during the middle of the last century. Technologically, the fauna belays the im-
pact of metal blades on animal processing. Graphic mapping of spatial characteristics of the
fauna yields a predictive model that can be tested through further investigation. Excellent bone
preservation helps track the spatial relationships linking cultural artifacts and fauna. (44)
Lubensky, Earl H. and William R. Fowler, Jr. (Missouri Archaeological Society) POSTCLASSIC
CEREMONIAL STRUCTURES OF CENTRAL EL SALVADOR Excavations of ceremonial struc-
tures, mainly at the postclassic site of Cihuatan in central E| Salvador, are discussed, with
special emphasis on indications of sudden departure of the innabitants from the sites. Smashed
incense burners at the base of the Western steps of the structures, apparent purposeful place-
55
, ment of obsidian blade fragments near the incense burners, and burnt remains of structural
| materials, especially wattle and daub, all in a matrix of a probable volcanic ash deposit, tell a
story of catastrophe. Speculation allows a vision of ritual “desanctification” of the religious
structures at the sites upon forced abandonment. (27)
MacDonald, George F. and Richard Inglis (Archaeological Survey of Canada) CHANGE AND CON-
| TINUITY IN NORTH COAST, BRITISH COLUMBIA, WOODWORKING: A THREE THOUSAND YEAR
| PERSPECTIVE The development of woodworking on the North Coast of British Columbia, the
historic territory of the Tsimshian and Haida people, is studied through the analysis of carving
tools and/or wooden artifacts from three time horizons: the prehistoric period between 3000 B. C.
and A. D. 1800, the contact period, and the late historic period. The implications for the time span
of the development of the Northern Style and “crest art” are seen to parallel the development of
ranking in northern Northwest Coast societies. The influx of Europeans during the contact period
intensified but did not alter the basic pattern. (43)
MacDonald, John (Oregon) and Richard Yerkes (Environment Consultants) THE LARGE MAMMAL
REMAINS FROM THE CLAH-CLEL-LAH SITE (45-SA-11), NORTH BONNEVILLE, WASHINGTON
The analysis of the remains of large mammals from 45-SA-11 provides data useful for understan-
ding the utilitzation of different areas of the site at different times of the year and in monitoring
changes in the cultural patterns of the aboriginal population who were in contact with Anglo-
Americans. The numbers of individuals of each species, the size, age, and sex of these in-
dividuals, and the parts of the bodies used for food, tools, or shelter provide insights into the ex-
ploitation of the fauna and the methods of animal butchering and processing. (3)

from 1969 to 1974. It will also summarize our plans for future publications—all six volumes—as
well as further programs of research. A brief summary of the sequence, the dates, the geological
findings, and the cultural implications of the preceramic will also be given. (7)

and there will be a discussion of some of the new breakthroughs in techniques and methods that
occurred, as well as a criticism of some of the faults of the researches. (19)
Marcotte, James R. (Colorado State) MANUFACTURING AND USE WEAR PATTERNS WITHIN A
SINGLE PROJECTILE POINT TYPE Within a single projectile point type, variations in mor-
phological attributes, edge wear, and fracture patterns are shown to represent various sequential
manufacturing stages and differential use. A sample of over 70 specimens from a single Archaic
component of the Porcupine Peak Site in central Colorado (elevation 3,000 m) provides a unique
opportunity for analysis. A five-stage manufacturing model best explains artifact groups
recovered from the site. Behavioral implications are discussed in view of these patterns. (41)
Marquardt, William H. (Missouri-Columbia) and Patty Jo Watson (Washington-St. Louis) SHELL
MIDDEN FORMATION AND DEFORMATION: A CASE STUDY The Green River shell middens, long
important to interpretations of eastern U.S. prehistory, have yielded cucurbits dating to 2500 B.C.
in an otherwise “forest efficiency” subsistence context. However, the depositional processes
responsible for the formation of these and similar sites are not well understood. Explanations of
changes in Archaic subsistence at this important time period necessitate a detailed understan-
ding of relevant physical and cultural site formation factors. A project combining geological,
paleoecological, and archaeological perspectives is described, and the contributions, both sub-
stantive and methodological, of the succeeding four symposium papers are explained. (16)
Marquardt, William H. (Missouri-Columbia) SHELL MIDDEN FORMATION PROCESSES: |M-
PLICATIONS FOR THE GREEN RIVER ARCHAIC The previous papers (in this symposium) have
reported the results of detailed archaeological, paleoecological, and geological research in-
tended to contribute to the understanding of shell midden formation and deformation processes.
Advances in our understanding of the sites, coupled with data previously gathered in western
Kentucky by project members and other colleagues, are summarized and brought to bear on
these related hypotheses: (1) the context of the oldest cultigens in the shell middens is a “forest
efficiency’ subsistence pattern; (2) as suggested by Caldwell, the impact of the cultigens on sub-
sistence was very slight because the forest environment was rich in wild food resources. (16)

, Marshall, Alan G. (Lewis-Clark) THE SOCIOECONOMIC BASES OF NEZ PERCE SETTLEMENT
AND SETTLEMENT PATTERN Economic inferences about southern “American” plateau ar-
chaeological sites suffer from the lack of an adequate ethnographic model of settlement and set-
tlement pattern. The dispersal of individuals in early-19th-century Nez Perce settlements was
largely governed by kinship and tenure. Nez Perces recognized two kinds of settlements: winter
villages and established camps. The locations, distribution, and internal structure of the habita-
tions reveal major economic parameters. (32)
Marshall, Sydne B. (Columbia) THE LAND MANAGER AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY LAB The context
of a lang managing agency often places demands on the agency archaeologist that differ from
those of the academic researcher. Laboratory facilities in the traditional sense of places for ar-
tifact processing and curation are not often included within the scope of a public agency’s
responsibilities. The agency archaeologist must plan cultural resources management projects in
accordance with agency goals, available facilities, and public responsibility. (30)
Maslowski, Robert F. (Corps of Engineers) MOOREHEAD GAVE: AN EXAMPLE OF
COAHUILTECAN CONTINUITY IN TRANS-PECOS TEXAS Moorehead Cave is a typical
rockshelter occupation in the Amistad area of Trans-Pecos Texas. The Amistad archaeological
assemblages represent cultural stability for thousand of years. While projectile point styles
change, the basic basketry, sandal, and cordage technologies persist, indicating a continuity in
cultural populations. Review of the historical, ethnographic, and linguistic data for southern
Texas suggests the Amistad area was occupied by Coahuiltecan bands. Several decorated peb-
bles from Moorehead Cave represent anthropomorphic figures with motifs similar to tatoos
and/or body paintings recorded for historic Coahuiltecan bands. (32)
Mathews, William GLACIAL CONDITIONS LIMITING HUMAN HABITATION ON THE NORTH-
WEST COAST During the period 29,000 to about 21,000 B.P. on the C.C. coast, ice tongues
from the higher mountains reached down to sea level (e.9., Strait of Georgia). These ice tongues
and the associated adverse climate contributed to a hostile environment for human migration
and occupation. During the period 21,000-13,000 B. P. (apart from a short interlude about 18,000
B. P.), glaciers overwhelmed most of the lowland areas, and occupation was possibly precluded.
From 13,000 to 11,000 B. P., the climate was ameliorating, and glaciers were withdrawing. The two
periods of high relative sea level would have barred human occupation of many of the lowland
sites. From 10,000 to 5,500 B. P. relative sea level was somewhat lower on the B. C. coast than at
present, and shoreline sites then occupied may subsequently have been destroyed by the later
rise of the sea. In Washington State the glaciers at their maximum were much less extensive than
in B. C., but the fluctuations in climate and associated changes in vegetation may for a time have
rendered occupation difficult. (34)

Matthews, Meredith H. (Colorado) THE CEREN SURVEY AND TEST EXCAVATIONS AT C-2 Con-
current with the excavations at the Ceren site, a cruciform transect survey was completed, using
the Ceren site as the focal point of the survey area. The major objectives of the survey were settle-
ment patterns, chronology, and site function within the localized Survey area. A brief testing pro-
gram was conducted at one of the three sites recorded in the Survey area (C-2), located approx-
imately 1.35 km SSW of the Ceren site. Test excavations at C-2 were conducted to establish the
chronological position of the site within a generalized regional culture period and within a
relative position to the Ceren site. Inherent in the objectives of the survey and testing program
was the establishment of a spatial and temporal context within which the Ceren site could be
placed, to avoid evaluating the site in a cultural vacuum. (11)
Maxwell, Moreau S. (Michigan State) SITE VARIATION ON SOUTHEASTERN BAFEFIN ISLAND
Many Dorset sites on the south coast of Baffin |sland, though occupied over long periods of time,
have produced few indications of residence structures. The paper will discuss the evidence that
does exist in its geographic and ecological setting, correlate it with faunal and artifactual re-
mains, and compare it with Dorset information from other locales. !n this context changes in set-
tlement systems, in site utilization, in hunting practices, and in population concentrations
through time will be interpreted and discussed. (44)
May, J. Alan (Missouri-Golumbia) SHELL MIDDEN FORMATION PROCESSES:
METHODOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE Anthropological descriptions of shell middens are known
from many parts of the world. These shell accumulations are thought to result from a subsistence
pattern characterized by seasonal occupations of hunting/gathering groups. Certain shell mid-
Gens in western Kentucky may aid in the understanding of cultural and noncultural mechanisms
of midden accumulation and erosion. Approaches utilized to Study these mechanisms include (1)
WPA excavation records, (2) soil augering, (3) water erosion of profiles. (4) horizontal mapping of
57
, shell orientation. These data have been used to construct and evaluate explicit models of midden
| formation. Results from the 1978 season are illustrated, and specific and general conclusions are
presented. (16)
Mayer-Oakes, William J. (Texas Tech) CONCEPTS OF THEORY IN OPERATIONAL AR-
CHAEOLOGY The theoretical framework for an operational approach to archaeology is based on
the explicit statement of “objectives” and appropriate “operations” in all stages—background,
planning, implementation—of a total archaeological research process design. These paired
“core” concepts are used at the levels of theory, where problems are stated, of method, where pro-
jects are designed, and of technique, where tasks are listed. This “OB-OP Hierarchy” is the
theoretical nucleus of our approach. Attention is given to the differences between activities as
| planned and as actually done, and the effects these differences can have on research results. It is
| noted that information about such differences and details of operations are rarely given in ar-
chaeological research reports. (39)

island is an area of high marine productivity, and the prehistoric bowhead whale fishery is one of
the richest known for the central Arctic. Early Thule whale hunters living here had indirect trade

McMillan, Barbara A. (Dartmouth) THE INTERPLAY OF ARCHAEOLOGIST AND CONSERVATOR
More archaeologists need to consult trained conservators, experts In material technology and the
conservation of artifacts, in order to preserve excavated data. The conservator should be utilized
| not only on historic sites but on any sites that yield vulnerable, perishable materials. For an-
thropological purposes this professional can stabilize materials without wiping away clues to
past cultural significance and can interpret these clues for the archaeologist. The conservator
should be an integral part of the setting up and processing of materials in the lab, be called upon
for emergency field situations, and advise on the proper storage and display of materials. (30)
McPherron, Alan (Pittsburgh) THE INTELLECTUAL MILIEU OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF AR-
CHAEOLOGY To what extent has archaeology developed in isolation of developments in other
disciplines? Most treatments of the history of archaeology do not devote much attention to the
contemporary trends in thinking, apart from the interdependence of archaeology and geology in
Britain and France or archaeology and ethnology in the U. S. in the early days. In fact, ar-
chaeology developed into a science in a milieu of intellectual activity that also involved the social
and earth sciences. The mutual interplay is examined through citation analysis of journals deal-
ing with archaeology, history, geology, and geography. The light that such work throws on the
history of archaeology is discussed. (19)

sites in southwestern Wyoming have added substantially to the catalogue of faunas indicative of
prehistoric Pronghorn (Antilocapra americana) utilization. Bone and projectile point assemblages
from camp and butchering sites indicate a continuity in Pronghorn use throughout the Late
Prehistoric Period. Radiocarbon dates ranging from about A.D. 600 to 1700 support this concliu-
sion. Similarities in butchering patterns are noted throughout the time period. Intermountain
tradition ceramics first appear in assemblages about A. D. 1100. Evaluation of the role of Prong-

EVIDENCE FROM NORTHERN BELIZE. Archaeobotanists working in wet, tropical regions have |
always been plagued by the problem of poor organic preservation. In order to recover carbonized
plant remains too small to be seen in excavations, water flotation was tested in the 1978 field
season at the Cuello site in northern Belize. The experiment proved successful in recovering
evidence of maize, yam, and cocoyam cultivation dating to the later third millennium B.C. The 4
samples also produced cohune nuts, wild gourd rinds, and over 30 kinds of identifiable wood
charcoal. (10)
Miller, Glenda F. (Catholic) FIELD RECOVERY AND PRESERVATION Archaeological specimens
are in continuous, systemic interaction with their environment, which includes each other. Ac-
curate assessment and treatment of specimens in the field can make the difference between
preserving the specimen and its information or not. Treatment depends upon the composition of
the material recovered and the conditions of soil, air, and water under which it has existed. Field
preservation techniques for materials such as wood, bone, various metals, fibers, hides, and
other organic residue will be discussed with respect to such factors as soil pH, presence of
chemicals, exposure to air and water, and temperature. (30)

both chronological and functional classifications. Several environmental variables are con-
sidered as factors potentially influencing site locations, and these variables are used to suggest
(1) change in settlement pattern through time and (2) the influence of site function upon the selec-
tion of a site location in a particular environmental setting. (41)

DYNAMICS ON AN URBAN FRONTIER Successful application of a frontier model to historic site
data and methodological developments in town plan analysis Suggest new directions of inquiry
into the sociological implications of recent settlement. At the level of individual sites, functional
components of the frontier model and their relationship to site structure may be isolated and
usefully employed to better understand postcolonial community settlement patterns, both
through a reworking of the model to enhance its applicability to early national contexts and
through consideration of settlement morphology from perspectives developed by urban
geographers. (32)
Minnis, Paul E. (Michigan) AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE ON FOOD STRESS Increasing
archaeological interest has focused on the role of food stress in cultural dynamics. This is par-
ticularly true for research in the American Southwest. Generally, food stress has been considered
as acute, episodic events—famines. This paper broadens the definition of food stress and con-
siders how food shortages relate to food stress and how food stress is related to cultural system
change. The concept of famines is enlarged to a perspective on food consumption variation. Ar-
chaeological and ethnographic examples are provided to illustrate the points raised here. (48)
Minor, Rick (Oregon) SITE DESTRUCTION OR SURVIVAL; LIMITING FACTORS IN INTER:
PRETING LOWER COLUMBIA PREHISTORY The destruction or survival of archaeological
resources is an important limiting factor in attempts to learn about the past. Yet the “complete-
ness" of the archaeological record is a subject rarely considered in most regional studies. The
‘mportance of this variable is most acute in studies involving river systems, as riverine en-
vironments are extremely susceptible to alteration as a result of both natural and man-related
causes. Focusing on the situation in the Lower Columbia River region, this paper discusses the
effects of the factors of site destruction or survival on current efforts to understand the prehistory
of the region. (3)

, resource as the only focus of a procurement system, jumping “annual round” and ‘division of
labor” under “scheduling,” and the a priori assumption of specific relationships between cultural
and environmental variables, “Procurement complexes” are proposed as the archaeological in-
dicators of procurement systems. Quantitative techniques, ethnographic analogs, and ecological
analogs are used to detect procurement complexes in a Northwest Coast site. The inference of
procurement systems from procurement complexes is discussed. (40)

Moore, James A. (Massachusetts) TERMINAL ARCHEOLOGY: THE USE OF COMPUTER SIMULA-
TION IN THEORY BUILDING Optimality models have generated a series of insights into the
variables that may structure subsistence and settlement behavior. However, one basic assump-
tion of optimality models for subsistence and settlement is the condition of perfect knowledge
among the decision makers. This is a simplifying assumption we know to be faise. Given the
violation of a basic assumption, how robust is the theory? Simulations of several experimental
information-sharing networks result in a divergence from the predicted optimal settlement pat-
terns. This case shows how simulation can efficiently and elegantly reveal the strengths, limits,
and blind spots of our theories. (2)
Moreau, Jean-Francois (Montreal) THE “INLAND” OCCUPATION ON THE PACIFIC COAST OF
PREHISTORIC NORTHWESTERN COSTA RICA Previous reports on 4 small noncoastal shell mid-
den in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, dealt with the marine mollusca remains and evidence
for seasonal occupation of the site that could be inferred from their analysis. The present report
presents the ceramic, lithic, and faunal data from the site, which offers a particularly good
analytical sample because it was slightly more than 50% completely excavated. Noncoastal
shell middens are an important settlement aspect of the Late Polychrome (A.D. 1200 to 1520)
period in Pacific coastal Costa Rica. (28)

Morlan, Richard E. (National Museum of Man, Ottawa) UPPER PLEISTOCENE ARCHAEOLOGY,
PALEONTOLOGY, AND STRATIGRAPHY IN NORTHERN YUKON TERRITORY The earliest known
evidence of human occupation in eastern Beringia can be evaluated in a stratigraphic and paleo-
environmental framework spanning more than 100,000 years and in the light of experimental
replications of a distinctive technology based in part on the percussion flaking of bone. Radio-
carbon dating supports the hypothesis that human populations entered Beringia before 50,000
years ago, and this early age implies that fully modern man may not yet have emerged in western
Eurasia when the initial peopling of the New World took place. The East Asian mainiand appears
increasingly likely as the area of origin for the first Beringians. (45)

cloth and socioeconomic and political growth. Political aspects of the demand for nonsub-
sistence goods will be explored, as will the organizational forms such production took and the
consequences of increasing production in further socioeconomic change. (14)
Morris, Elizabeth Ann and Daniel R. Mayo (Colorado State) CURRENT RESEARGH AT THE LIGHT-

in the Plains-Rocky Mountain ecotone. Cord-marked ceramics and Hogback projectile points in
association with several hearth styles overlie scattered Late and Middle Archaic remains. Eight
radiocarbon dates from the former range from A.D. 180 + 115 to A.D. 1160 + 120. One date from
an Archaic hearth is 3440 + 165 B.C. (UGa-1388). Notable is a large slab-lined Hogback age hearth
packed with charcoal and fragmented burned bone. Investigation of this feature, faunal analysis,
and the potential for archaeomagnetic dating will be the foci of 1979 research. (41)

OF THE USEFULNESS OF BORDES’ MOUSTERIAN CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM While Bordes'
classification system for the Mousterian marked a major advance in systematized Paleolithic
studies, the behavioral basis for many of the indices used remains unknown but is assumed to
have a “cultural” basis. The requirements for using and applying Bordes' system are evaluated for
the Levantine-Mousterian and found wanting. The determinants of a number of Bordes indices
are evaluated using data from a small area in southern |srae! where we have some control over in-
trasite variability, resource availability, curation, and occupation duration at sites. We conclude
that Bordes’ system can be dropped without harm to Mousterian studies. (23)
Muto, Guy R. (Oklahoma) EDGE DAMAGE: THE OTHER POSSIBLE CAUSES Edge damage to
lithic artifacts has been used to infer prehistoric use, behavior patterns, manufacturing tech-

in archaeological analysis and interpretation. However, edge damage is not always the product
of human behavior, nor is it always the product of prehistoric human behavior. Two other possible
causes need to be examined; natural agencies, such as pedoturbation, and recovery/post
recovery damage including screen wear, shovel retouch, and sorting spalls. Results of observa-
tions and experiments are presented that point out the problem, and a model is developed to in-
itiate the process of factoring out the other possible causes of edge damage to lithic implements.

from 42 of 143 squares revealed vertical shifts in flake size, materials, and morphology. The same
attribute covariation occurred horizontally (square by square). A factor analysis based on vertical
trends scaled the 42 squares in relative sequence. Factor scores correlated with square flake fre-
quencies and were assigned to remaining squares using Jinear regression. Mean artifact factor
scores were compared for selected groups using the f test. Trends in artifact size and morphology
are compatible with the flake sequence. (29)

, whereby they may be protected and managed. The applicability and problems of aerial photo-
graphic techniques employing conventional methods and NASA imagery will be discussed, as
will the problems of logistics and below sea level excavations in the marshlands. (37)
Neusius, Sarah W. (Northwestern) FAUNAL REMAINS, FLOTATION AND SAMPLING AT KOSTER:
METHODOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS Since modern archaeological excavation includes thorough
recovery of faunal remains, efficiency in analysis should become a central concern of the ar-
chaeozoologist. At Koster, flotation samples from the Middle Archaic horizons alone contain over
two million pieces of bone and shell. The sampling strategy developed for these materials has im-
portant implications for archaeozoological method. First. it indicates that efficiency involves not
only a reduction in the number of pieces examined but also an awareness of the number and
nature of attributes that need to be recorded. Second, at Koster important information is being
gained from sample attributes other than species composition. (15)
Nichols, Deborah (Penn State) PREHISPANIC IRRIGATION AGRICULTURE AND SETTLEMENT
PATTERNS IN THE BASIN OF MEXICO: A TEST CASE A major theoretical controversy in Meso-
american archaeology concerns the role of hydraulic agriculture in the evolution of settlement
systems in the Basin of Mexico. Evaluation of this hypothesis has been difficult because of lack
of archaeological data on pre-Hispanic irrigation, but preliminary results of a research project,
Settlement Survey in the Basin of Mexico: New Methodological Procedures (1977), indicate that
such subsurface remains can be detected with infrared aerial photography. Investigation of a
subvalley of the Guadalupe Range has provided new data on pre-Hispanic irrigation and its incep-
tion during the Middle Formative. These data are discussed in relation to the evolutionary history
of the local settlement system, which reflects wider processes of change in the pre-Hispanic set-
tlement systems of the Basin of Mexico through the Aztec period. (9)
Nichols, Jacqueline (New Mexico) THE DEMANDS OF AN EFFICIENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD
LAB The archaeological field lab is no Jonger a laundry for washing/marking artifacts, norisita
holding station for temporary processing/conservation. Today's research projects are frequently
long-term, regionally wide ranging, or both, demanding an efficient locus of information process-
ing, immediate analysis, and routine field testing. The ability to organize and maintain such a
locus requires skills equal ot that of field director. It is proposed, therefore, that the status of lab
director should be upgraded. Further, such a lab will, of necessity, make demands on fieldwork.
This interaction will have positive effects on the research, (30)

CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS The usefulness of effec-
tive regional research designs to the archaeological profession and federal agencies concerned
with the management of cultural resouces is considered in this paper. The development of such
designs from large-scale contracts dealing with cultural resource overviews and sample-oriented
inventories is explored through the use of specific examples. Advantages and disadvantages of
regional research designs are identified, and their effects upon the management of cultural
resources and the designing of specific projects within a given area are discussed. (4)

future objectives are noted. (28)
Novick, Andrea Lee (Institute of Archeology and Anthropology, South Carolina) CURATION OF
DOCUMENTATION The increasing growth of archaeological research and contract work has
resulted in a tremendous increase of archaeological collections. Often these collections have
been viewed as a means to an end, artifacts to be collected, reported, and then stored at an in-
stitution. Records documenting site location, field notes, artifact analysis, and collection origins
are often left incomplete. It is imperative that archaeologists realize that these collections are the
future data base. In the coming years these collections wil! be analyzed and reanalyzed in light of
a number of different research designs and problems; therefore accurate documentation is
essential. (31)

Nowak, Michael (Colorado College, USFWS) OCHER AND OCEAN BAY Excavations at KOD 224,
a stratified site on Uganik |sland (part of Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge) turned up evidence that
suggests that the red-stained deposits often associated with Ocean Bay | are due to deliberate
cultural activity rather than the natural weathering of hematite. Recovery of a concave grinding
slab filled with ocher and four grinding stones on a heavily ocher-stained floor suggest this in-
ference. The site sits at the conjunction of an open bay and a lagoon system, providing access to
both littoral and deep-sea resources. (44)
O'Connell, James F. (Utah) SITE STRUCTURES AND DYNAMICS AMONG MODERN ALYAWARA
HUNTERS Recent investigations of intra-site spatial organization among the Alyawara, a central
Australian hunting population, are reviewed in detail. Individual household camps and special ac-
tivity areas are described, and the factors that determine their distribution within sites are iden-
tified. The Alyawara pattern is compared with that described by Yellen for the !Kung, and the
results are expressed in a modification of Yellen’s Ring Model. Implications of the changed
model for current approaches to the analysis of prehistoric intrasite spatial organization are iden-
tified and discussed in terms of specific examples drawn from the literature. (33)
Odell, George H. (Brown) THE EXPERIMENTAL USE OF STONE PROJECTILE POINTS: SOME IM-
PLICATIONS FOR THE FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF PREHISTORIC ARTIFACTS Although a con-
siderable amount of experimentation has now been performed on damage accruing to stone tools
from utilization, very little basic experimentation has been done on the results of projectile point
usage. This paper describes a series of experiments in which various lithic raw materials were
employed to provide points on arrows and spears, then tested by firing them into objects of
various kinds. Results suggest a wide range of damage forms and a consistent difference be-
tween the portion of the point under the hafting device and that outside it. (72)

the English ALT. This constitutes a primary step to be followed by additional ones in order to ex-
plain the differential level of technology between the two. (23)
Oliver, James S. and David W. Von Endt (Smithsonian Institution) A HISTOLOGICAL PROCEDURE
FOR IDENTIFYING THE ANTLERS OF CARIBOU, MOOSE, ELK, AND VIRGINIA DEER: A NEW
TOOL FOR ARCHAEOLOGISTS A histological study of skeletal bones, ivory, and four types of
cervid antler demonstrated that each possessed a unique vascular structure. The vascular canals
of caribou antler are oriented in a parallel (plexiform) manner. The canals of elk are distributed
longitudinally and oriented along the vertical axis of the antler. Virginia deer antler exhibits a
reticular structure with slight parallel patterning toward the cortex. Moose antler displays a well-
developed reticular structure with many canals running perpendicular to the cortex. These find-
ings have been tested by taking small sections from several archaeological tools and identifying
the raw material. (25)

Olson, Gerald W. (Cornell) EFFECT OF VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS UPON SOME MAYA SOILS IN EL
SALVADOR The area affected by the llopango volcanic eruption in El Salvador shows evidence of
the deterioration of the soil resources. Sites are buried under two volcanic eruptions: one 1,000
years ago and another 1,000 years earlier. A widespread superior deep (1-2 meters) weathered
clayey reddish soil was discovered at a depth of several meters under the present landscape
formed during a period of geologic stability (extending from about 40,000 to 2,000 B. P.), and then
was buried. In places at least three superimposed soi! profiles with Maya artifacts have
developed in the different tephra layers. (4)
Olszewski, Deborah and Alan H. Simmons (Arizona) DIFFICULTIES WITH THE ANALYSIS OF
SOUTHWESTERN LITHIC ASSEMBLAGES A consistent and detailed \ithic analysis concen-
trating on technological attributes was applied to a series of assemblages from central Arizona
representing a wide geographic and temporal span. The analysis included total assemblages,

63
, although the emphasis was on debitage. Lithic analysis in the Southwest has long overempha-
sized tools and yet frequently lacks clear criteria for defining formal types. Our analysis Suggests
that many of the assemblages observed are opportunistic and contain but few formal tool types.
An analytical procedure involving debitage analysis that emphasizes technological variability is
seen, therefore, as a profitable avenue of investigation. (8)

IDAHO Test excavations at the Braden burial site have revealed new evidence of possible multi-
ple interments of secondary burials. This discovery casts some question on the age of a previous-
ly dated “mass” burial feature. The question now is whether the site contains multiple burial
components of different ages. The 1978 excavations also encountered heavy concentrations of
red ochre and a few metallic crystals, common Archaic burial expressions. The summer's
fieldwork was supplemented by archival and museum research to document related private col-
lections in western Idaho. (41)

Paynter, R. W. (CUNY-Queens) FROM SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS TO SETTLEMENT PATTERNS: A
STUDY IN NON-EXPERIMENTAL CONTROL Prehistoric settlement analyses usually assume a
simple relation between geographic models of human locational behavior and archaeologically
recovered settlement patterns. This hypothetical simple relation is studied for the settlement pat-
terns of stratified societies. Data are drawn from the relatively well controlled domain of historic
archaeology—particularly the Connecticut River Valley. The spatial distribution of an ar-
chaeological index is compared to the spatial distribution of variables more closely related to
geographic models. Particular attention is paid to how these relations change across a range of
stratified societies. The results are suggestive of the nature of this relationship in various
prehistoric cases. (2)

Perlman, Stephen (Virginia Commonwealth) OPTIMUM FORAGING BEHAVIORS AND NUT
RETURN RATES Predictive models have generated implications for temperate forest hunter-
gatherer settlement patterns. These models have stressed the impact of meat protein on site
location. This situation reflects the return information available to the archaeologist and not
assumptions that vegetation is unimportant. To fill this gap, the behavioral correlations
established by optimum foraging strategy models and tests will provide a framework for
generating general expectations for gathered nut returns. A nut gathering experiment verifies the
value of these behavioral correlations for man. The results of the experiment establish some im-
plications for hunter-gatherer subsistence strategies and associated behavior. (2)

be older than 3,000 years, gaps in the record of the last 3,000 years, a lack of broad surveys for
studies of settlement patterns, and needs for more large-scale excavation of sites, botanical and

prehistoric cultural development, “phases” are frequently established as convenient time-

and implements from four components assigned to a single cultural phase of the Ayacucho se-
quence are examined in detail to establish kinds and ranges of technological behavior

Plog, Fred (Arizona State) DEALING WITH SITES: PRESERVATION OR ARCHAEO-POKER?
Although the conceptual framework of cultural resource management has developed rapidly,
confusion and/or implicit disagreement on a number of critical issues remains. This paper ex-
amines three such issues: the relationship of management information to research, the relation-
ship between preservation and data recovery programs, and student participation in contract pro-
grams. Academic and agency archaeologists share responsibility for these problems. Their
resolution will come not from theoretical discussions of the meaning of such concepts but from
substantive applications, more thorough explorations of concepts such as preservation in rela-
tion to comprehensive summaries of the cultural resource base in specific areas. (17)

Plog, Stephen (Virginia) MEASUREMENT ERROR IN ANALYSES OF CERAMIC VARIATION
Ceramic variation is increasingly being analyzed as a means of measuring variables such as site
function. The analyses frequently are based on attributes that are difficult to measure and thus
are very much subject to measurement error. However, little is actually known about the
magnitude of such error. An attempt is made to assess the importance of measurement error in
explaining variation in ceramic attributes. (22)

Pomerantz, Howard J. (SUNY-Buffalo) THE ORIGINS OF DOMESTICATION: AN EXPLICITLY OB-

that neither the “Childian” climatic determinant model nor the “Binfordian” demographic theory
is Independently sufficient to explicate the process. Rather, a complex interaction of the two
variables provides a much more acceptable model of the situation observed in the Levant, one of
the earliest centers of cereal domestication. The method and results presented here have ap-
plication and important implications for solving the basic problem of the development of
agriculture. (38)

Portnoy, Alice W. and William J. Mayer-Oakes (Texas Tech) DETERMINING ARCHAEOLOGY:
AGENCY ORIENTATIONS Many federal and state agencies are instituting contracts with profes-

ciés oriented to clearance/compliance, “management-oriented” agencies (e.g., National Park Ser-
vice, Interagency Archeological Services, Bureau of Reclamation, Corps of Engineers). Most ar-
chacologists are unaware of how these different orientations affect the discipline of archaeology
itself in many important ways, including types of service, contract, and project; quality of work;
results of research; use of data; and level of agency direction of research in planning and controll-
ing. Various agency orientations and their effects on archaeology are discussed. (39)

Discriminant analysis will be employed to test this proposition. The nonstructural variables will .
then be used to predict the presence of structures on all unexcavated sites in the eastern lease
area of Black Mesa. (38)

the Lower Falls of the Winooski River and the lake, serves as a test case for a proposed Middle

multidisciplinary contributions permitted formulation of the model, which involves seasonality
and selective resource exploitation through time. (40)

traverses historical buried remains, including the earliest shipbuilding yards on the Great Lakes,

quences derived from geomorphic and archaeological investigations are related to general pat-
terns of subhumid and arid deposition, taking into account regional and local contributions to a
basically aggradational pattern. Local structural controls that produce variable deposition are
described. Depositional data indicate a climatic shift at about A. D. 1000 involving adjustments in
the annual rainfall cycles from well-distributed to poorly distributed storm patterns. This is sup-
ported by ancillary data from pollen and snail analyses, including local and regional materials.

Purdy, Barbara A. and Raymond F. Willis (Florida) RECOVERY, PRESERVATION, AND STUDY OF
WOODEN ARTIFACTS IN FLORIDA Since the 1890s, when the Key Marco Site was excavated,
many sites with similar preservation conditions have yielded a variety of wooden objects pro-
viding unquestionable evidence that the prehistoric inhabitants of Florida were skilled wood-
working technologists. Recent drought conditions have drastically lowered water levels of lakes
and rivers, exposing strata with entombed canoes and other wooden items. Recovery, dating,
storage, preservation, and study of these specimens are imperative, but logistics problems exist.
These difficulties are weighed against the overall benefits to be derived if the problems are
solved. such as knowledge about stylistic variations, manufacturing techniques, and wood
preferences and properties. (37)

, —— a
on and is acted upon by culture. By devoting more analytical time to elucidating environmental
systems, archaeologists also clarify cultural systems. An independent model of the past environ-
ment is required, based on the present environment, the known past environment, and ecological
principles. Comparing independent cultural and environmental models clarifies both and thereby
the nature of the cultural adaptation central to the research. Research on climatic variability in
modern Yugoslavia will be applied to a model of Neolithic behavior. (21)

Rathje, William L. (Arizona) DENTAL MUTILATION AND THE CLASSIC MAYA The interna! struc-

interesting characteristic of Maya burials is dental mutilation, which occurs in the form of both
filing and intaying of teeth. Patterns in dental mutilation from several Classic Maya sites will be
compared. Specific types of filing and inlaying will be related to specific role positions in Classic
Maya society, and differences in patterns between sites will be related to a general model of
social mobility and resource diversity. (13)

Reagan, Michael and Ralph Rowlett (Missouri-Columbia) AN EARLY MAN SITE IN NORTHWEST
MISSOUR! Two early assemblages were recovered from the Shriver site, from two different
loesses of the last glaciation. The paleo-Indian occupations at 8690 + 1000 B.C. and 12,855 +
1500 8.C. are dated by thermoluminescent analysis. On the basis of geologic correlation, lithic
analysis, and cultural stratigraphy, an age older than 13,000 B.C. is proposed for the Lithic stage
occupation. Artifacts of the Lithic stage assemblage, including tools struck from prepared cores,
and artifacts of the paleo-Indian assemblage are compared with artifacts reported for other early
sites. (45)

Reid, J. Jefferson (Arizona) WHEN ARCHAEOLOGY FAILS A critical look is taken at potential ex-
cesses in contemporary archaeological research. Major misdirections discussed are when
research is treated as methodological virtuosity, as a literary form, as little more than fieldwork,
and as a duplication of conventional wisdom. Mention is made of the “Mr. Roger’s Effect.”
Design, data collection, analysis, and reporting are emphasized as equally crucial phases of the
research process, The point is made that while small-scale research projects can absorb the ef-
fects of naive and overzealous misdirection, large-scale programs run the utterly dismal risk of
abject failure. (38)
Reidhead, Van A. (Missouri) HUNTER-FARMERS IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICAN PREHISTORY:
THE LIMITS TO GROWTH This paper uses economic models to examine some of the ecological
Geterminants of population growth and adaptation among agricultural peoples in prehistoric

respect to the total growth potential of populations. (40)
Reynolds, Georgeanne L. and William S. Laughlin (Connecticut) PHASE ANALYSIS OF
ANANGULA CORES AND ITS APPLICATION TO LITHIC STUDIES Phase analysis is viewed as an
analytical method in the categorization of certain lithic tool classes. Traditional methods are of
value but lack insight into the “lifetime” of the artifact, tending instead to “freeze it in time.” All
phases of manufacture are present in the series of cores from the 1974 field season on Anangula
tstand in the Aleutians. The collection is analyzed, accounting for the wide range of variation pre-
Sent and including those specimens not conveniently typed. Traditional typologies are ques-

are presented on the size and configuration of Maya occupation within the savanna region,
together with a preliminary chronological framework for the evaluation of settlement dynamics

Rice, Glen E. (Arizona State) MODELING MICROENVIRONMENTAL REDUCTION The transition
from a seasonal round to a sedentary intensive agricultural system involves increased sedentism
and a reduction in the diversity of the resource base. One aspect of this process of “microen-
vironmental reduction” (Flannery and Coe 1968) is simulated using a monte carlo technique. The
model is then applied to a twelfth-century settlement pattern change in the Mogolion tradition as
an alternative to explanations citing such processes as environmental deterioration (Zubrow
1971), population growth (Plog 1974), drought, or warfare (Danson 1957; Bluhm 1960). (48)
Rice, Prudence M. (Florida) SOME CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE STUDY OF SPECIALIZED POT-
TERY PRODUCTION Craft specialization is hypothesized to be a process of regularizing
behavioral and material variety in extractive and productive activities. The paper discusses
criteria for archaeological recognition of products of specialized pottery manufacture and
presents a model of the evolution of such specialization. Pottery specialization is hypothesized
to begin in the area of prestige/ceremonial goods, manifested earliest through standardized
paste attributes. In complex societies pottery manufacture is increasingly an exercise in stan-
dardized mass production, and elaboration exists chiefly in elitelceremonial goods. (14)

PROBLEMS AND SOLUTIONS IN ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF BIRD BONES
Bird bones are an important component of archaeological fauna; yet their study was often
neglected in the past. In recent years there has been a vast increase in the capability of identify-
ing bird bones, and archaeological interest in these vertebrates has intensified. Even when pre-
sent in small numbers, bird remains can often provide valuable evidence of site seasonality, hun-
ting strategies, and habitat utilization. This paper considers two critical problems in the study of
avian faunal remains: identification and seasonality. (25)

NORTHWEST COAST Radiocarbon dates on marine shells are reliable and accurate data for con-

dissolved marine bicarbonate (the reservoir age). New radiocarbon analyses of prenuclear
twentieth-century marine shells indicate a reservoir age correction of —801 2 23 years for
Oregon and Washington coasts and the northern Puget Sound and —680 + 15 for the California
coast. We apply reservoir age corrections to several archaeological shel! dates from the southern
Northwest Coast and obtain excellent agreement with extant chronologies based on charcoal
samples. Reservoir age corrections for other coasts are summarized. (7)

MORTUARY SITES Adena, whether seen as a mortuary complex, culture, style zone, or time
period, has been poorly understood since its definition in 1920. Much of the variability within
Adena has been ignored or linked purely to temporal sources. This study examines several
variables in a number of Adena mortuary sites, with the aim of discerning whether (a) Adena
represents a single cultural and social phenomenon and (b) social structures of equivalent levels
of complexity are apparent throughout the Adena area. Sources of variation are also considered.

Rogers, Anne F. (Georgia) VARIATION IN MAGDALENIAN LITHIC ASSEMBLAGES Recent
analysis using statistical techniques has indicated that variability in Magdalenian lithic
assemblages is only partially attributable to temporal and spatial differences, Analysis of tool
counts from 135 assemblages resulted in the formation of five major clusters, each containing
assemblages from diverse locations and time periods. These groups were then examined to
determine the underlying variability responsible for the assignment of assemblages to clusters,
resulting in the discovery that certain tool types differed in relative frequency from one group to
68
>
, another. The recognition of this aspect of variability in these assemblages provides new informa-
tion concerning technological differences that existed during this period of the Upper Paleolithic.

Ross, Richard E. and Sandy L. Snyder (Oregon State) RIVERINE ADAPTATIONS ON THE CEN-
TRAL OREGON COAST The Umpqua site (35D083) is located near the mouth of the Umpqua River
on the central Oregon coast. It is one of the few known sites in this area that shows sequential oc-
cupational layers over a relatively long time. There is some evidence to suggest that the site was
utilized as a semipermanent base, as opposed to many of the shell middens along the coast,
which were occupied for rather short durations. The earliest material, consisting of a few lithic
tools, lies directly on the alluvial clays of the terrace. Later portions of the site show refuse activi-
ty, including small shell concentrations. The shell in the site has helped the preservation of bone
material; so a good collection of perishable artifacts and identifiable faunal material have been
recovered. This phenomenon, as in many other coastal sites, allows for relatively detailed
analysis of aboriginal resource utilization by the inhabitants. (24)
Foss, Richard E. (Oregon State) and Esther Stutzman (Coss Indian Tribal Council) INDIANS AND
ARCHAEOLOGISTS: AVOIDING THE CIRCLED WAGON TRAIN SYNDROME Native Americans
and archaeologists are interested in many of the same questions about peoples in the
Americas—when they got here and the kind of adaptation strategies that were subsequently
employed. The two groups of people have generally approached these problems from very dif-
ferent perspectives. More recently, however, the two groups have been faced with situations
where mutual involvement is critical. It is our belief that Native American and archaeological
goals and resources are quite similar. This paper examines the resource (archaeological sites)
from two viewpoints while trying to identify some of the mutual interests. (39)

Runnels, Curtis N. (Indiana) LITHIC TECHNOLOGY IN THE IRON AGE OF THE OLD WORLD The
hypothesis that chipped stone tools were completely replaced by metal ones in the tron Age is
refuted. The data include published evidence of recent tool use (glass, gun flints, threshing
sledges, medieval artifacts) as well as unpublished assemblages from Iron Age sites in Greece.
The competing uses of stone and metal tools are stated, and the survival of stone tools is ex-
plained in analytical economic terms. The utility of stone is stated as a functionof the price of
metal, which is directly proportional to the distance of use area from distributional center. (23)
Rutier, Nathaniel W. (Alberta) LATE QUATERNARY CLIMATIC RECONSTRUCTION OF THE
AYACUCHO BASIN AREA OF THE CENTRAL PERUVIAN ANDES Paleoclimates were determined
for the late Quaternary. Surface soils vary from lithosols in low, dry, hot areas, through several
varieties of chernozems in middle elevations, to soils similar to Arctic Browns in high, moist, cool
areas. Buried soils are progressively better developed with increasing age than their surface
counterparts in the same ecological zone. Two periods of valley glaciationare detected in the
nigher elevations. Results, aided by pollen analysis, suggest that the climate has become slightly
arier during the past 14,000 years. Ecological zones have remained about the same with perhaps
2 slight upward shift in elevation. (1)

located along the south coast of Baffin Island, N.W.T., are analyzed to clarify ecological relation-
ships underlying Neo-Eskimo adaptations from ca. A.D. 1100 to the beginning of the present cen-
tury. Long-term stability and continuity in the organization of subsistence technology, settlement
patterns, and resource procurement are noted. Adaptation to broad-scale regional environmental
characteristics, based upon flexibility in exploitative orientation, group structure, and
demographic arrangements permit strategic responses to short-term environmental! fluctuations
without major structural changes in subsistence organization. (44)

in order to round out a previous analysis based on the marine remains of the island. The main
goals of this study were (1) to determine if there was intraisland variation in the utilization of

areas or ethnohistorical sources. The excavated materials provide some insight into the various
different cultura! influences that impinged on the area. Of special interest are the close affilia-
tions of the Early and Middle Woodland assemblages to those of central and northern New York
and the Upper Hudson Valley as opposed to the geographically closer cultures of the coastal

Sanger, David (Maine-Orono) TOWARDS A MODEL OF MARINE ADAPTATION: RESEARCH IN
THE GULF OF MAINE In various parts of the world, societies with a hunting-gathering economy
have flourished in marine environments. Five key factors will usually be present where high
human density marine adaptations are found: (1) high plankton concentrations; (2) animals (con- |
verters) predating on the plankton; (3) suitable capture and storage technology; (4) estuarine set-
tings with significant intertidal zones; (5) a supportive terrestrial environment to compensate for
periods of low marine productivity. These five criteria serve to outline a model that can guide
research strategies and serve as a predictive device for locating areas suited to marine hunters
and gatherers. (24)
Santley, Robert S. (New Mexico) PRICING POLICIES AND THE DECLINE OF TEOTIHUACAN :
CIVILIZATION Teotihuacan is regarded as having exerted far-flung influence throughout pre-
Columbian Mesoamerica. Recent research at Teotihuacan has demonstrated that a large amount i
of activity was devoted to obsidian working. In this paper the discriminatory pricing model is ap-
plied to obsidian industry and exchange system centered at Teotihuacan, since it provides a
measure ef the capital returned to Teotihuacan from exchange ventures abroad. Implications
concerning the internal dynamics of Teotihuacan-dominated exchange and Teotihuacan's col-
lapse are drawn; the Teotihuacan system is found to be too hypercoherent, with effective com-
petition from other manufacturing/trading loci providing the stresses necessary for systemic
decline. (9)
Sappington, Lee (Idaho) THE LYDLE GULCH SITE: OBSIDIAN SELECTION AND PROCUREMENT
IN THE NORTHERN GREAT BASIN Analysis of the Lydie Gulch site in southwestern Idaho in-
dicates that this prehistoric open site was typical of temporary hunting camps In the Northern
Great Basin periphery. The artifact assemblage shows an occupation from Archaic through Late
Prehistoric periods, a span of 5,000 years. Approximately 80% of the lithic material is obsidian,
although the nearest source is 40 miles away. X-ray fluorescence analysis indicates the use of 11
obsidian sources, although only a few were favored throughout the entire occupation, Other
results include a minimal use of exotic material and continuity in selection and procurement
despite technological changes. (41)
Saxe, Arthur A. (Ohio) NAN MADOL ON PONAPE, EASTERN CAROLINE ISLANDS, MICRONESIA
The presence of relatively complex sociocultural systems in the small and scattered Caroline
island chain in the Pacific is yet to be explained. Recently such research has been initiated on
several fronts. Nan Madol appears to have been the administrative center of Ponape !siand and of
several islands. It is sometimes referred to as the "Venice of the Pacific” because of its location
on approximately 100 man-made islands. Linkages between oral tradition, the monumental basalt
architecture of Nan Dowas (largest above-water structure), and the mortuary architecture of high-
ranked bureaucratic tombs facilitated the task of bounding the site. (13)

occupation level lies unconformably below a level dated at 10,170 + 250 (RL 641) years B.P. Sup-
port for pre-Clovis occupation comes from the combination of the stratigraphic context, unques- .

recovery in the Zapotitan Valley was effected with the recolonization and reestablishment of site-
to-source access during the Classic Period. The basic industry is the same, but some procedures
and products differ. Nonecologic factors explain the changes, for the changes reflect general
Maya industrial developments rather than adaptive adjustments to changed circumstances in the

Lithic data from the early thirteenth-century occupation of Salmon Ruin and from a lithic
workshop site in the four corners area is used here to hypothesize certain aspects of lithic
resourcetexploitation and social organization of some prehistoric Southwestern agriculturalists.
Initial and secondary reduction steps of “Tchamajilia” manufacturing were being carried out at
the resource outcrop, and the resultant tools were being transported to Salmon Ruin and other
permanent habitation sites a considerable distance from the resource acquisition area in a
“finished” or near-“finished” stage. Results based upon resource exploitation patterns and use
parameters of “Tchamajilla” manufacturing and maintenance debitage support the generalized
model that some "“Tchamajillas” were being produced by a group of full- or part-time specialists.

Classic Maya farmhouse and adjacent cultivated fields. The excavations have also revealed
substantial amounts of several varieties of polychrome ceramics, as well as a lump of hematite
and hand-molded clay, in situ on the house floor. Previous Mesoamerican archaeology has
tended to equate polychrome ceramics with the elite. Physical similarities between the raw
materials and the polychrome ceramics are now being assessed by petrographic and

Spurling, Brian E. (Simon Fraser) RESOURCE INVENTORY AND ASSESSMENT IN THE BOREAL
FOREST This paper presents a field-tested methodology designed explicitly for inventory and
assessment of cultural surface cover. The inventory aspect of this sampling strategy involves (1)
the stratification of the study area, (2) the selection of random 500-m-a-side quadrats for each
stratum, and (3) a subdivision of every quadrat into 100 equal sized subunits each of which
receives examination by the placement of a 1 mx 1m randomly selected test unit excavated until
a C horizon or basal gravels are encountered. The assessment side of this sampling strategy is
founded upon the same three principles. However, the size of the quadrat is reduced to 100 m per
side, and the placement of quadrats is made non-randomly, i.e., the smaller quadrat (quadrito) is
positioned over a known find spot. The output from quadrito excavation units informs upon the
shape, volume, structure, and contents of individual cultural resources. Both strategies have
been successfully employed over a two-year period in a watershed of northeastern British Colum-
bia approximately 149 km 2 in area. To date approximately 12% of this region has been examined
using the above techniques. (12)

INNOVATION The use of bibliographic citations provides a basis for studying the development of
American archaeology. Analysis of bibliographical references in American Antiquity from 1946

through 1978 clarifies and demonstrates changing trends in archaeological research and makes

explicit the marked increase in works emphasizing a processual orientation. The “life-cycle” of .
the published work is illustrated. Citation networks, constructed through the coupling of co-cited

works and the development of these patterned data, results in a modeling of the intellectual
structure of a developing idea. Such networks can serve as indicators of specializations within a
discipline, clarify changing relationships between and within specialties, and point to new ;
research directions within the discipline. (19)

‘og views of Native Peoples that archaeologists have held. In the nineteenth century, Native
Peoples were regarded as unprogressive savages, a view reflected in the “Mound Builder” myth,
which held the earthworks to be the work of non-Indians. In the first half of the twentieth century, |
there was even less concern with Native Peoples, coinciding with declining interest in functional
m@erpretation of archaeological data and loosening of ties with ethnography. The New Ar-
smaeology continues to treat prehistoric Native Peoples as objects rather than subjects of
research. (19)
Trombold, Charles Dickson (Illinois) TOWARD AN EMPIRICAL DELINEATION OF SETTLEMENT
MIERARCHIES IN COMPLEX SOCIETIES This paper explores a methodological framework to
enable the ethnographer and/or the archaeologist to delimit a settlement's hierarchical order on
te Dasis of functional content alone, specifically on the order of entry or threshold of any given
Seonomic function. This framework involves the almost perfect congruence of Guttman scaling to
seth Christaller's conditional order of entry principle and Losch's area-serving principle in terms
2 differential allocation of incremental functions. In addition, the Guttman technique may be of
great value in studying individual site-functions in terms of their relationship to population ag-
gegates. (46)

reviews both pipes and calumets, indicates their changing associations and significance, and
considers a rapid postcontact diffusion of certain aspects of their use. Finally, a case study
Gawn from seventeenth-century documentation is used in conjunction with Wallace’s discus-
Son of revitalization movements to support the contention that extensive calumet ceremonialism

THE USE OF ROCK SHELTERS IN THE AYACUCHO VALLEY, PERU. The analysis of the sub-
sistence remains from two deeply stratified rock-shelter sites in the Ayacucho Valley, Peru, sug-
gests that the occupants of these sites were practicing different resource-selection strategies,
One site indicates that the occupants were dependent on small mammals and most probably
plants while the other site in a different environment has remains of mostly cervids and camelids.
It is suggested that these different strategies relate to seasonal differences and that, for the An-
dean environment in general, rock-shelter occupations are more apt to be seasonally specific
locations. (1)

isted in Inca and probably earlier periods. Empirical observations of looms and loom parts and
the presence of high-quality early historic textile fragments recovered from village churches fur-

other, “amorphous” assemblages are characterized by systematic unifacial curating of unifacial-

employed by business firms are desirable and necessary. Archaeologists dealing with conserva-
tion projects are held accountable to taxpayers, employees of the project, and the sponsoring
firms or agencies for the quality of their research. The utilization of proven management prin-
ciples will not preclude high-quality research but, with strategic application, will always assist

pret their meaning in a functional behavioral sense. An alternative approach is offered here,
which includes (1) the examination of features in their contextual setting and (2) the use of
analogy as a method for deriving propositions about feature interpretation as opposed to an ex-
planatory element. (15)

term agriculture frequently resembles an almost taxonomic attempt to define a particular type of
economy. Agriculturalists within various broad geographical contexts are viewed as fairly
| homogeneous populations engaging in similar subsistence activities. In the American
- Southwest, this homogeneity involves the cultivation of major food crops such as corn, beans,
and squash. The labor expended in the successful procurement, propagation, and preparation of
these crops assumes certain forms described as characteristic of southwestern farmers. This
generic ence fails to consider (1) the extent to which agriculture was a significant com-
ponent of the overall economy and (2) the possible variation in southwestern agricultural prac-
| tices even in contiguous areas. Using archaeological data from Arizona, New Mexico, and Col-
| orado, these problems will be discussed. (48)

‘Semy Corps of Engineers, have revealed the depressions of several semisubterranean plank
Muses at 45-SA-11. The formal features of these excavated plank houses and the material from
er fills are examined and compared with ethnographic descriptions of Chinook plank houses.
_ The results of these studies are used to discuss the adaptations of the native inhabitants of this

‘TRE CASCO BAY REGION, SOUTHWESTERN MAINE Maritime hunter-gatherers in New World in-
Suiar settings have developed effective exploitation of both intertidal and offshore resources. |
_ Establishing the nature of prehistoric settlement patterns in insular settings depends upon (1) re-
Genstructing prehistoric shorelines to determine their position and coastal gradient; (2)
_=srimating the biomass of intertidal resources available; (3) evaluationg areas as rookeries for
sea mammals and birds; (4) assessing the location and concentration of upwelling Zones; and (5)
Getermining the degree to which other resources might serve as population buffers. In archipel-
‘S905 with smaller islands, such as the Casco Bay region of southwestern Maine, semisedentary
- settiement patterns were the rule. Effective exploitation of such archipelagos relied on fragmen-
280m into microbands. In such a situation, the degree of sedentism possible depended on local
| Sde patterns and food storage techniques. For this reason, the island area-population size cor-
‘=2hons of island biogeographers cannot be Strictly applied to such systems. (24)

_ SA POST-ERUPTIVE ECONOMY The 1978 Protoclassic Project recovered a total of 137 ground |
Store artifacts, including 14 (10%) from the Ceren site, 27 (20%) from the Cambio site, 89 (65%)
em the Zapotitan Valley survey, and 7 (5%) from the Ceren survey. Analysis was oriented toward
SPecy of both morphology and utilization, the latter involving wear pattern analysis and ethno-

SSIN. EL SALVADOR The Cerén site is a Classic period residential site, buried during its occu-
petron by four to five meters of tephra ejected from a nearby volcano, A house— including stand-
" wells and columns—was preserved, as was a nearby platform. An associated milpa, with
szsts of immature maize plants, was discovered near the structures. At least eight activities |
‘ = activity areas may be postulated for the inhabitants of Cerén, owing largely to the unusual

a DATA The paper considers criticisms leveled against catchment analysis at the practical and
arétical levels. To incorporate these criticisms, the function of the analysis is redefined. Three
w2yS are proposed to render the method more powerful and comprehensive: introducing ecologi-
‘tely defined but culturally significant measures such as niche width; constructing predictive
ecels of site location; comparing features of natural environment with those reflected in site .
_Setcnmments. Difficulties associated with extension of the analysis in these ways are discussed
