, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(2) PLUNDERERS, PROFITEERS AND PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY: PRACTICAL APPROACHES
TO PREVENTING THE LOOTING OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AND THE TRAFFIC OF
ANTIQUITIES.

How did Indiana Jones get away with it? This symposium presents a provocative examination of
the cultural values in the United States and Canada which affect those who would plunder and profit
by the looting of archaeological sites. Practical approaches used by state or provincial archaeology
offices and local organizations to deal with this problem are explored and their relative success
evaluated. The symposium will focus on programs which deal effectively with looting and the sale
of artifacts taken from sites located on private, state, provincial or municipal lands. The programs
feature the strong enforcement of antiquities laws, prosecution of violators, public education, and
@etreach.

.*) THE EARLY UPPER PALEOLITHIC: EVIDENCE FROM EUROPE, THE NEAR EAST, AND
NORTH AFRICA.

The purpose of this symposium is to focus attention on the early Upper Paleolithic as a distinct
emmy in the archaeological record, yielding important contrasts with both the Middle and later Upper
Paleolithic. The papers range from topical concerns (e.g., fauna or art) to areal syntheses for various
parts of Europe and the Mediterranean Basin. Temporal boundaries vary geographically, but through-
at these regions transitions in the archaeological record may be identified at 40,000-35,000 B.P. (or
semewhat earlier) and 25,000-20,000 B.P.. The possible implications for human social, economic, and
eelrural behavior during the intervening period are explored.

5) RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOHISTORIC RESEARCH IN THE STATE OF
OAXACA: A STUDY OF AN ANCIENT CORE AND ITS PERIPHERIES.

This symposium reviews on-going archaeological, art historical, and ethnohistoric research from
several environmentally diverse regions in the state of Oaxaca, Mexico. Important historical and
@tganizational differences in prehispanic patterns of change and development are noted between the
Walley of Oaxaca core and other areas in the state. Various perspectives (including environmental
comsiderations, macro-regional approaches, and historical analyses) are employed to interpret these
@stinctive evolutionary trajectories. A broader understanding of ancient Oaxaca and its prehispanic
@versity should result.

) GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE ANDEAN COAST: RECENT ADVANCES.

Over the past decade, there has been an increasing awareness among archaeologists working on the
Andean Coast of the interrelationships between alterations in the climate and the physical environ-
ment on the one hand and prehistoric society and culture on the other. This awareness has been
accompanied by a number of important, sometimes controversial, new studies integrating geological
and archaeological data. Contributors to this symposium address processes such as coastal uplift, sea
level change, beach ridge formation, and the El Nino phenomenon from the perspective of both
geological studies and archaeology, in order to understand better the relation of people to environment
== the Andean past.

7) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SOUTH ALASKA: SUBSTANTIVE AND THEORETICAL
CONTRIBUTIONS.

This symposium will be concerned primarily with the presentation of substantive data from a
member of current research projects conducted in the southern Bering Sea, Aleutian, and Kodiak
segions of south Alaska. Contributions will examine the time span from the earliest known inhabit-
wets to the Russian-American era. Ethnohistorically this region was once solely occupied by distantly
selatred Yupic-speaking Eskimos and Aleuts, who, in combination, far outnumbered related cultures
tamging from northwestern Alaska to Greenland. Traditional and recent theoretical concerns will
adress such issues as the evolution of complex hunting societies or “affluent foragers”; model
building; the reconstruction of ecology, demography, and settlement patterns; the evaluation of the
soles of migration, diffusion, and in situ development; and the relationship of human biology, language,
aed culture over time and space.
®) INTERREGIONAL INTERACTION IN PREHISTORY.

The purpose of this symposium is to provide an overview of approaches to the question of what
sele interregional interaction plays in prehistoric processes of social change. This broad subject has
excited considerable interest among archaeologists of late as seen, for example, in the development

39

of trade, world system, and peer polity interaction models. Participants in the symposium will use

their diverse research experiences and theoretical perspectives as 2 base for considering the strengths

and weaknesses of different approaches and the variety of interaction processes attested from different

parts of the world.

(9) DIXIE CUPS AND CROWN JEWELS: ANALYTICAL APPROACHES TO THE

ORGANIZATIONAL PROPERTIES OF STONE TOOL TECHNOLOGIES.

The concepts of curation and expediency have been defined as extremes in acontunuum of planned
organization of technologies (Binford 1979), While these ideas are widely referenced, most researchers
continue to rely on post hoc definitions and expedient analytical critena in studying them. In this
symposium, researchers studying lithic data from a yanety of contexts will critically explore common
themes: 1) the utility of concepts such as curation and expediency 15 interpreting the archaeological
record, 2) methods for investigating the organizational properties of prehistonc technological systems,
and 3) the relationship between subsistence system, rsw material availability, and planning in the

production and use of tools.
(11) THE FOREIGN RELATIONSHIPS OF TEOTIHUACAN.

Although its influence was widespread in Middle Honzon Mesoamenca, Teotihuacan should not
be viewed as a monolithic force in its interactions with other societies. Its effects took a number of
forms, and may have been mediated through a vanety of agents: state emissaries, traders, military
adventurers, refugees, etc. Symposium participants will explore the evidence for Teotihuacan influ-
ence in their areas, and will assess the impact of Teouhuacan oo loca] cultures and on their devel-
opmental trajectones: The reflexive effect of these interacnans on Teouhuacan itself will also be
discussed.

(14) DESERT AND OASIS: HOLOCENE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE WESTERN DESERT OF

EGYPT.

Archaeological and palaeoenvironmental investigations in the Westem Desert of Egypt highlight
the role of desert regions in agricultural ongins and human responses to the changing post-glacial
climate. The symposium aims to present some of the move recent and dramatic discoveries from the
beginning of cattle management during the early Holocene to she Sgharan origins of Nilotic food
production, interregional diversity and connecnens, chrooology. palacoclimate and cultural change.
(18) GOVERNMENT PROCESSES AND THE COAL INDUSTRY: CAN ARCHAEOLOGISTS

ADAPT?

Surface coal mining operations affect hundreds of aschacolog:cal sites every year. Most coal mining
— operations in the United States, especially in the East, are permutred by State mining authorities, not
the Federal government, although the Office ot Sustace Mining reviews and approves those State
' programs. Federal laws protecting histonc resources trom Federal acuons do not apply directly. If
archaeologists are'to have 3 positive effect on the treatment of resources affected by coal mining, they
must learn to use the review processes that do apply to the permitting of coal mining. The papers in
this symposium discuss these processes from the Federal, State and private points of view, and present
two cases of archaeological work done under State mining programs.

(20) HUNTER-GATHERERS AT THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM: THE GLOBAL RECORD.

Contemporary questions about past human adaptatioas and cultural practices call for the control
of data on large spatial scales. This symposium will otter comparative data on paleoenvironments
and the distribution and adaptanon of hunter-gatherer in the world at a particular climatic moment

- the last glacial maximum around 18,000 B.P_ Papers will present a synthesis of available data on

different regions of the Old World and nete and consider the significance of discontinuities in the

record, The discussants will commentos 1) the problems faced in attempting a global survey including

questions about how data are collected and the comparability of different data sets 2) the status o

groups in the New World, and 3} offer suggestions on the directions for future research to take.
(21) ECONOMY & SOCIETY IN THE MEDIEVAL NORTH ATLANTIC.

The session centers upon the archaeology of the Scandinavian North Atlantic, with an emphasi
on environmental/economuc approaches adopted recently by North American and Scandinavian work
ers. The session includes papers 08 the bref Vinland settlement, the now extinct Norse colony ¢
Greenland, Iceland, and the commercially successful Shetlandic community. Several papers wi
discuss the complex interplay of Little Ice Age climatic change with regional politics and changin
trade networks, combining social and environmental explanations. All papers present new data trot
a region and period attracting increasing attennon from anthropological archaeologists.

, \23) Radiocarbon Update 4]

(23) RADIOCARBON UPDATE: PROGRESS AND PROBLEMS IN RADIOCARBON DATING.

Recent advances in radiocarbon dating techniques such as accelerator mass spectrometry and high-
peeczsion calibration have virtually revolutionized the field. Undersized samples such as seeds or
celngens, blood residues, and bone fragments, formerly unsuitable for dating, can now be dated with

peccssion and speed. Dendrochronological calendars have been extended back in time to about 13,000

years B.P. and across continents, from the west coast of the United States to continental Europe. New

calibration curves are now available for the highest precision in dating. Progress in radiocarbon dating
sechmuques have also led to new problems, for daters and users, in managing and utilizing the mounting
sechacological data.

(28) THE EFFECT OF VISIBILITY ON THE INTERPRETATION OF SETTLEMENT PATTERNS.

Owe of the first questions students always ask archaeologists is “How do you know where to dig?”

Sevatiably, the answer involves something about pertinent previous research. But how pertinent is

rus research? New detection techniques and ethnoarchaeological guidelines from many parts of

whe world suggest that preconceived ideas about where to dig may cause serious biases in data
election. This symposium presents a set of case studies offering new insights on the interpretation

@ achacological settlement data. Ethnoarchaeological studies from Nigeria, Greece and Honduras

@er 2 broadened perspective on interpretation, while innovative techniques reported from China,

Stee, Jordan, Central America, and the southwestern U.S. suggest some new answers to the old

@@estion of how archaeologists decide where to dig.

28) AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE VARIABILITY IN THE PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST.

Past studies of prehistoric agriculture have tended to examine the evolution of agricultural strategies

 eophasizing a single type of land-use, such as water management systems. This symposium will

S@mess the interaction of labor availability, resource concentration, and economic considerations that
Seey heve been responsible for the diversity of land-use strategies in the northern and middle Rio
Seende Valley in New Mexico. In order to highlight this diversity papers focus on the role of limited
Semewity sites within these agricultural land-use strategies.

7) SITE STRUCTURE AND SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF SEDENTARY COMMUNITIES

See Structure and the organization of space are important analytical concepts that have been

seepfered primarily in hunter-gatherer studies. Analyses of activity arrangements, however, can also

(eters significant insight into the material record of non-mobile societies. This symposium explores
‘he Lectors that condition the location and execution of activities in sedentary communities. Papers
Seem om the unique scheduling requirements and spatial constraints affecting task performance, An
‘pes is placed on linking activity structure and spatial arrangement in sedentary settings to their
Seeeeral consequences in the archaeological record.
= CURRENT ISSUES IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE NORTHERN ANDES.

_ Tiss symposium will showcase new investigations in the Northern Andes (Southern Colombia,
‘ed and Northern Perv) by both established and younger scholars. The work reported contributes
we enderstanding of basic regional chronology and culture history in this poorly-known but
‘Selly important region, and illuminates prehistoric subsistence strategies including water man-
“Sent, and patterns of exchange and inter-regional contacts in an environmentally complex geo-
epee! area lying between Mesoamerica and the Peruvian culture area.

States and offers examples of solutions to this dilemma.
(33) PROBLEMS IN ONTARIO PREHISTORY
This session illustrates a range of theoretical and methodological approaches current in Ontano
prehistoric archaeology. There ts a0 emphasis on the time depth and cultural diversity present in this
geographically diverse region which stretches from New York to Minnesota and from the Great Lakes
to Hudson Bay. There will be consideration of problems of research and of cultural resource manage
ment in regions of difficult access, and a consideration of the effects of accessibility on the perception
of prehistoric resources.
(35) APPROACHES TO DATING NORTH AMERICAN ROCK ART.
The chronological position of rock art in vanous North American culture areas remains an unre-
solved problem. Within the past decade, a number of divergent approaches to dating rock art have
begun to appear. This symposium will present research results trom a range of archaeological studies,
including the chemical analysis of pigments and patination, the composition and physical detenora-
tion of rock art, dating rock art by associated archaeological materials, the distribution of historic
period artistic motifs, and the use of oral history, ethnography and ethno-archacological sources for
dating. The speakers conduct their work in California, British Columbia, the Great lakes area,
Wisconsin and Ontario.
(38) BEYOND COUNTS, CAT. ALOGS AND CHRONOLOGIES: NEW DIRECTIONS IN ROCK
ART RESEARCH.

Traditional analyses of prehistoric rock art have provided little archaeological or anthropological
inference and interpretation. New work from three continents, presented here, takes three comple-
mentary directions to £0 beyond this traditional impasse. Ethnohistorical/ethnographic approaches
provide a fuller picture of what the art represents and its role in society. Formal methods of studying
the geometry and internal systematics of engravings, not dependant on an ethnographic context, give
information of a different character. Ethnography of communication-based studies analyze the art as
an archaeological artitact of prehistoric ritual, attempting to place the nature of the ritual, and thereby
the meaning of the art, ina soci0-religious context.

(40) EXCHANGE SYSTEMS IN NORTH AMERICA: CONNECTIONS AND INTERFACES.
Native North Amencan peoples were constantly moving commodities across regional boundaries.
Such interactions had social, economic, and epidemiological impacts on the various exchange groups.
_ The emphasis of this symposium is on the types of commodities traded, the intensity of interaction,
and the structure of these exchange systems. To better understand these systems’ dynamics prior to
: and after the time of contact, the participants of this symposium will examine exchange systems
both temporally (from Paleoindian through protohistoric periods) and spatially from Canada to Costa

Rica. Such coverage represents our current knowledge concerning the connections and interfaces

between aboriginal peoples throughout North America.

(41) PROVINCIAL INKA: PROBLEMS AND MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION.

Within the short span of 100 years, the Inka conquered and incorporated large numbers of ethnicall
diverse groups into a single empire, Tawantinsuyo. The historical development of Tawantinsuyo ha
been reconstructed from various Inka and Spanish sources, but documenting this development archae
ologically has been problematical. In particular, identifying Inka-induced changes 1n provincial area
is difficult, because the distinctions between Inka and pre-Inka material culture are not well-defines
The papers in this symposium provide data concerning the Inka presence in provincial areas and the
ramifications for interpreting the cultural interactions between the conquerors and the conquered.
(42) THE GARDENS OF PREHISTORY: A LOOK AT CULTIVATION NEAR THE RESIDENCE
FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE ARCHAEOLOGIST.

The symposium examines recent research by archaeologists and geographers conceming near re:
dential gardening (including kitchen and door yard gardens) and prehistoric agriculture. The pape
concentrate on: the definition of different systems of infield cultivation based on their form a
content, the identification of garden areas 1n prehistoric contexts using chemical and conventior
archaeological methods, and ethnoarchaeological research targeted at understanding the gardens
an important component of ancient settlement and site structure. The papers range areally from

American Southwest, through Mexico and Central America, to northern South America. The disc
sants offer critiques from the perspectives of archaeology and geography.
, |44) The Interpretation of Spatial Patterns 43
»@#) THE INTERPRETATION OF SPATIAL PATTERNS WITHIN STONE AGE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES.
ietra-site spatial analysis has been dominated by a variety of quantitative methods for the recog-
qeeeen of spatial patterning. Of equal importance is the development of a body of theory for interpreting
spatial patterns. This symposium will examine a selection of both stone age archaeological and modem
Qeepter-gatherer sites, focusing on behavioral, depositional, and other aspects of site formation. The
Qreeram will be organized to trace through the paleolithic record, the size of sites, the number,
Sessity, size, shape, and composition of scatters of material remains, and possible interpretations of
Se events that formed the spatial patterns. Ethnographic data will be used to examine the relationship
‘etween spatial patterns and the processes that formed them.
~&®) EASTERN PALEO-INDIAN LITHIC RESOURCE UTILIZATION.
The theme of this session is eastern Paleo-Indian treatment of lithic resources as a key for inferring
weber aspects of their cultural systems and to understanding their adaptations. Besides making sub-
Semmtive contributions to our knowledge of Paleo-Indians from Florida to Ontario (such as the sourcing
@ Gehics and its implications for settlement mobility and exchange), the papers examine important
SSeoretical questions of interest to a wider range of archacologists. These include: the causes of lithic
Qeecurement patterns; the effects of technological organizational factors like mobility and lithic
lSec= access on inter-assemblage variability; and the explanation of change in lithic industries.

= DEMOGRAPHY, PRODUCTION, AND EXCHANGE IN THE EVOLUTION OF COMPLEX
_ S@CIAL ORGANIZATION IN LATE PREHISTORIC EUROPE.
‘The cultures of Europe since the end of the Bronze Age, that is in the last millennium B.C. and the
‘Se millennium A.D., were marked by the evolution of increasingly complex social systems. At
Sees times and places such manifestations as towns and social stratification appeared and disap-
but the overall trend was toward the establishment of these forms on a widespread basis and
kena of the pattern that was to characterize historical Europe. This symposium will evaluate
“Qe ~s=portance of varying factors which may have promoted or limited this development. The
@eewetical difficulties of approaching this problem will be analyzed, and then the different forms
we’ complex societies can assume will be examined in relationship to causal factors.

plishments on the other. Archaeologists must respond by critically evaluating past accomplishments
and planning the future accordingly. Topics discussed in this symposium are pertinent to refining
cultural resource management, They include evaluating past efforts at overviews, data bases, modeling
and planning; pursuing research on nationally important topics; and addressing the limitations of
planning-based approaches.
(55) POST-PROCESSUAL STUDIES IN PACIFIC ISLAND ARCHAEOLOGY AND
ETHNOHISTORY.

Recent research on several different islands and archipelagoes in the Pacific is presented in this
symposium. Extending naturally from the idea of islands as “laboratories” for the study of cultural
processes, the central organizing theme pursued is the exploration of alternative strategies for mod-
eling the documented diversity of social, political and ideological conventions framing these island
societies. General symbolic and structural principles are assembled and examined within the contex-
tual framework of restraints and consequences of the natural and social environment. Reference to
the historical inheritance of particular cultural traits 1s seen as 4 fundamental element of contextual”

archaeology-
(56) INEQUALITY AMONG HUNTER-GATHERERS.

The symposium and following discussion among archaeologists and ethnographers will focus on
the usefulness of the concept of inequality and power relations in the study of hunters and gatherers.
The myth of the egalitarian hunter-gatherer has permeated work on these groups to the exclusion of
the study of their power relations and inequality. While there 1s some danger that such studies will
lead to the view that inequality 1s universal, the monolithic view of egalitarian hunter-gatherers
misses the diversity and the dynamics present in the power relations of hunter-gatherers, whether
prehistoric or more recent.

(59) NEW PERSPECTIVES ON NORTHERN BOREAL FOREST LIFE.

Recent years have seen steady progress in research on the archaeology of boreal forest areas. New
approaches, such as ethnoarchaeology and related studies in linguistics and oral history; new data
from the ethnohistoric record; and funding from land claims investigations and cultural resource
management requirements have all contributed to this effort. In this session, researchers will present
and discuss some of the current methods and resulting new perspectives for studying late prehistoric
contact, and historic period dwellers of the northern boreal forest in western Canada and Alaska.

(60) STRUCTURAL AND SYMBOLIC STUDIES IN TEXT-AIDED ARCHAEOLOGY.

The recent growth of interest in symbolic and structural archaeology has had mixed result:
Prehistoric studies have found the identification of meaning in the archaeological record to be prot
fematie-and have been open to charges of abstraction and unverifiability.

This session therefore attempts to explore the potential of such approaches in a range of areas whe!

« archaeological information may be combined with texts of various forms. A structural approach
seen as useful in integrating these data, while conversely such studies demonstrate the true potenti
of such forms of analysis.

Ackerman, Robert E. (Washington State)
THE EARLY CULTURAL HORIZONS OF INTERIOR SOUTHWESTERN ALASKA.
The earliest cultural horizon (c. 11,000-8,000 BP) is represented by sites containing artifact assem-
blages of the Paleo-Arctic/Beringian Tradition and an as yet poorly defined projectile point tradition.
These sites are found on the foothills of the Kilbuck and Kuskokwim Mountains beyond the extent
of Pleistocene glaciation and probably represent a periglacial occupation during the early warming
phases of the Late Wisconsin. This cultural horizon was followed by a shift in the hunting patterns
fom the foothill zone to the previously glaciated mountain uplands. Assemblages of this period are
gsouped under the Late Tundra Tradition |c. 8,000-6,000 BP). These two cultural horizons will be
explored in terms of site and assemblage relationships against a background of changing paleoenvi-
penmental conditions.|7)

NEW EVIDENCE FOR THE DIFFUSION OF THE NUMIC SPEAKERS IN THE GREAT BASIN.
Analysis of the extensive perishables assemblage from Dirty Shame Rockshelter in that part of the
morthern Great Basin in southeast Oregon has revealed several major shifts in artifact occurrence and
teguency that are most parsimoniously explained by a population replacement model. Changes in
two major cordage types, the disappearance of all three major sandal types, and, perhaps most impor-
tamt, the appearance of coiled basketry at the site appear to signal the arrival of Numic-speaking
populations, probably the Northern Paiute. This interpretation of the perishables is supported by the
tethics and other data from this site as well as by data from other Great Basin sites, notably the
Monitor Valley caves in Nevada and information from the August, 1986 excavations at Danger Cave,
Ussh. Collectively, these data appear to offer convincing artifactual evidence for the advent of the
Nemnic speakers in the Great Basin and the chronology of that event.(51)

SLAVERY IN LATE PREHISTORIC EUROPE: RECOVERING THE EVIDENCE FOR SOCIAL
STRUCTURE IN IRON AGE SOCIETY.

Most of our information regarding social structure in the early Iron Age is based on cemetery
evidence which represents only a fraction of the total population and scant regional settlement data.
There are three important issues to be investigated: (1) Can some continuity be assumed from the
early to the late Iron Age, and if so how can it be archaeologically corroborated? (2) How can new
questions be asked of the existing archaeological data to clarify this aspect of early Lron Age society?
(3) What research directives do the findings generated by these questions suggest?(48)

CULTURAL PROCESS AND CHANGES IN CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY IN TICUL, YUCATAN,
MEXICO.

It is widely believed by archaeologists that changes in ceramic technology are reflective of broader
cultural changes in the society. How are changes in ceramic technology related to cultural processes?
Using a model of feedback processes described elsewhere (in Ceramic Theory and Cultural Process,
Amold, 1985}, this paper will explore the relationship of various cultural processes and the changes
in ceramic technology that occurred in Ticul, Yucatan, Mexico, between 1965 and 1984.(32)

A SITE STRUCTURAL APPROACH TO MODELING CERAMIC PRODUCTION.

The spatial and temporal distribution of activities within a household provides important clues
into the behavioral constraints affecting domestic task performance. Ceramic production, a common
activity among sedentary communities, is also subject to these limitations. Ethnoarchaeological
research among Mexican potters is used to develop a model of production behavior as reflected in the
utilization of space and activity scheduling. Emphasis is placed on the material consequences of
activity organization, and the transition in the archaeological record as production becomes more
intensive.(27)

ETHNICITY AND ADAPTATION: PREHISTORY IN NORTHERN HIGHLAND ECUADOR.

Autochthonous development is the single most pervasive characteristic of prehistoric societies of
| northern highland Ecuador. This is in stark contrast to the customary view of social development for
this area, which emphasizes inter-regional ties and diffusion. Recent research in northern highland

Ecuador is reviewed from the period of the earliest known agriculturalists until the advent of the

Incas. The insular character of the prehistoric societies of this area is argued to be a predictable result

of adaptation to inter-group and intra-group competition, which is expressed in terms of well-defined
social boundaries and ethnic markers.(28)

A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE CERAMIC SITUATION IN THE LOWER MOPAN-MACAL
TRIANGLE, BELIZE.
Adjoining the prehistoric archaeological community of Baking Pot on its upriver southwest is that
of Buenavista del Cayo. Encompassing some 175 km? of the pentagonal valley bottom defined by the
lower Mopan and Macal Rivers, this realm includes the regal-ritual palace-centers of Xunantunich
and Cahal Pech as well as many smaller sites and the major urban administrative center, Buenavista.
Based on recent excavations and earlier work, this paper outlines a preliminary ceramic sequence for
the Buenavista community and discusses its relationships to those of neighboring polities in Belize
and Guatemala. The sequence stretches from the seventh century B.C. into the tenth or eleventh
century A.D.(57)

This paper explores human exploitation of two quarnies in the central Mojave Desert. Technological
analysis and cation-ratio dating of refitted core/flake Sequences indicate that despite major changes
a technology and human mobility, raw material selection, and reduction strategies, the range of
objects removed from these sites remained constant throughout prehistory. Changes occurred in the
rates at which the sites were exploited and in the kinds of objects emphasized in production during
different periods. These results indicate that human use of these sites was conditioned by several
factors in addition to settlement pattern, including raw material quality and abundance and quarry
location.(9}

relationships among facilities, artifacts, and refuse. Variability in household structure and camp layout
is strongly seasonal. Linear rather than circular camps at Kua San dry season camps contrast with

THE MEDITERRANEAN LEVANT DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM,

Cold and dry conditions prevailed over most of the Levantine Region. The three vegetationa! belts
recognized today as Mediterranean, Trans-Turanian and Sahara-Arabian had different spatial distri-
butions. Palynological and geomorphological evidence points to the expansion of deserts, and the
retreat of shrubland and woodland associations to the coastal ridges and plain. The small number of
known Epi-palaeolithic sites exhibit considerable local typological diversity which may express a
degree of sedentism which originated under stress conditions. Exchange of Mediterranean marine
shells for personal ornaments and similarities in lithic reduction techniques testify to regional net-
works. However, when compared with preceding and succeeding periods, this time span indicates a
diminution in the overall occupied territory, reduction in interregional contacts and possibly a
decrease in population size.(20)

EXCHANGE AND OBSIDIAN: CHANGING TRADE STRUCTURES IN THE SOUTHERN

PLAINS.

The study of archaeological obsidian from a series of southern Plains sites has revealed some rather
interesting results. Prior to A.D. 1400 (from Late Archaic through Early Plains Village periods),
obsidian artifacts have been traced to northwestern Plains and/or Plateau sources. After A.D. 1450
\during the Middle Plains Village period), this material is derived almost exclusively from South-
western sources (especially sources within the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico). This paper will
examine the changing dynamics of southern Plains exchange using climatic, ecological, and social

DOMESTIC SPACE AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN THE OSMORE DRAINAGE OF

SOUTHERN PERU.

This paper investigates the relationship between the design of domestic architectural space and
human social organization. Basic to the thesis of this study is the belief that the specific use of
domestic space 1s determined by prevailing modes of social behavior in a particular community, which
in turn are shaped by wider dominant organizational pattems. On the diachronic level, it follows that
modification in domestic space through time as seen in the archaeological record is due either to
evolutionary change within a society or to its replacement by a society with different organizational
norms. Archaeological data derived from recent work in the Osmore drainage of southern Peru are
used to explore these questions and to study the nature of social evolution and human interaction in
the Southern Andes.(27)

OPERATIONALIZING THE CERAMIC SPHERE CONCEPT.

The 1965 Maya Ceramic Conference defined a ceramic sphere as“... existing when two or more
complexes share a majority of their most common types - . . implying high content similarity at the
typological level.” Recent work in Mesoamerica—the South Coast of Guatemala and the Sula Valley
of Honduras—has applied this concept to investigate cultural interaction. This paper describes the
methods used, the problems encountered, and the assumptions made in using the concept. Conclu-
sions about interaction in these two areas are discussed in terms of what the ceramic sphere concept
contributes to this type of analysis.(57)

20,000 B.P. Aspects of site size, relative density of artifacts, the main traits of lithic assemblages,
bone and antler industries, as well as ochre finds, grinding stones, and human remains are briefly

| reviewed. It is demonstrated that cave occupations present a subsystem within a much larger adaptive
system. Changes in the nature of cave utilisation are interpreted as resulting from changes in overall
spatial organization of Levantine Upper Palaeolithic entities.(4)

The archaeological and skeletal data excavated from the Early Bronze Age shaft tombs at Bab Edh-

that a highly corporate, unstratified group structure characterizes the social organization of this
period. These data imply that kin and polity were not incompatible features during the Early Bronze
phase of urban development, nor were the acquisition of social status and the growth of hierarchism
inevitable concomitants to increased social complexity.(3)

of this altiplano culture is relatively poorly known. Recent excavations at the regional Tiwanaku site
of Lukurmata have provided further insight into rural Tiwanaku settlement during the Tiwanaku [V
and V periods (400-1200 A.D.). Complete excavation was made of Tiwanaku habitations associated
with a characteristic Tiwanaku civic-ceremonial structure. This has allowed examination of Tiwa-
naku domestic unit sizes, ceramic preferences, and household artifact assemblages. These data form
the basis for an interpretation of Tiwanaku provincial community organization.(52)

understanding the structure and organization of prehistoric settlements. The present study addresses
these issues by providing information on the size and structure of a multi-component Saladoid/
Elenoid site located on the north coast of Puerto Rico. Results of a two stage sampling program are
presented. The first stage employs a series of mechanically excavated auger pits and is found to provide
a cOarse-grained view of the internal organization of the prehistoric settlement. Intensive excavation

« in selected areas of the site supplies detailed information on residential, cemetery, and refuse disposal

magnifications from 100x to 400x. A series of slides and experimental tools will illustrate the types
of polishes and other microscopic traces on tool surfaces resulting from some common processing
procedures. Some of the limits on inferences based on polish appearance will be discussed.(53)

PROGRESS, HOMEOSTASIS, CONTRADICTION, AND INHERITANCE: MODELS OF HUNTER-
GATHERERS IN HISTORIC PERSPECTIVE.

Because anthropology has always portrayed hunter-gatherers to suit its theories, the changing
manner in which certain key concepts have been applied to these societies is particularly instructive
regarding the intellectual history of our discipline. In this sense the current debate over the presence
and intensity of inequality among hunter-gatherers is best seen not as an argument about fact but
about theory and in particular an argument that pits neo-Marxist theory against neo-Darwinian theory.
The former emphasizes social relations and internal transformations, the latter technology, environ-
ment, and selection.(58}

RADIOCARBON DATING WITH ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETRY.

to be dated to the same precision as with conventional radiocarbon dating techniques. The use of
small microgram-sized samples of bone, wood, plant remains, seeds, charcoal, steels, and shells or
foraminifera solves, in many cases, the problem of which material should be selected in the field for
dating. The experience with accelerator mass spectrometric dating over the last two years has provided
better answers to questions of optimal number of samples and optimal sample materials.(23)

PEOPLE AND THINGS: TERRITORIALIZING SOCIAL REPRODUCTION IN EARLY
EUROPEAN DEVELOPMENT.

The archaeological study of state formation in early medieval Europe has overturned models of
European development long propounded by historians. This paper considers the crucial intersection
of state power and household formation in medieval England. It argues that the state did not succeed
in territorializing the household until the turn of the thirteenth century. The paper then considers
the implications of territorializing the household for social reproduction, The paper concludes with
suggestions for rephrasing models of development in medieval England. The historic processes of
personification and objectification at work in the early English economy have comparative relevance
for the study of contemporary indigenous economies.(48)

ORAL LEARNING AND THE INTERPRETATION OF ROCK ART.

Both rock art and folklore may be considered phases in the systematics of non-literate communi-
cation. The understanding of each contributes to the understanding of the other: they share the basic
processes of signification and transmission, and oral hermeneutics encompasses interpretation in
both media. !Kung folklore research indicates narrative information processing bears marked simi-
larity to information storage and innovation in visual media. In fact, since images of rock art and
folklore in southern Africa are often cross-referring, important correlations may be made among these
images. Past quantitative studies in both fields suggest computer tools for interpretation. Reference
is made to an experimental project in the Lower Pecos River area, Texas, on Computer storage and
manipulation of computer graphics and related documentation. The implications of this approach for
southern African research are explored. The paper 1s organized around a general discussion of the
evolutionary success of hunter-gatherer communication systems.(38)

TAXATION, NUTRITION, AND TRADE: ISLAND ECONOMY IN THE MIDDLE AGES.

Archaeological data indicate that major changes occurred in the domestic economies and material

growing integration with Continental Europe during this period and documentary sources suggest

that trade in dried fish was the primary integrating force. When viewed in light of local ecology, and |

documented contemporary changes in regional politics and commerce, these developments appear to

be adaptive responses to stresses from a) demographic expansion, b) the establishment of taxation,

and c} the limited range of local food resources.(21}

PRELIMINARY STUDIES OF TIWANAKU LIMNOLOGY.

This paper presents preliminary results of a limnological study in the Lake Titicaca basin. Samples
; were taken near the Tiwanaku sites of Pajchiri and Lukurmata, and in a small lake, Chullumpi Kota.

These yielded 7 sediment/water interface cores (estimated to represent 250-1000 years of sedimen-

results of 2°Pb and “C dating, physical and chemical analyses, and pollen analysis. The data will
allow examination of hypotheses concerning nutrient efficiency of various kinds of Tiwanaku agri-
culture, the effects of different land uses on the terrestrial system, and inference of pre-civilization

NORTHEASTERN ALGONQUIAN EGALITARIANISM: ABORIGINAL OR POST-CONTACT?

Leacock and Lee (1982) have defined the characteristics of egalitarian societies (e.g,, Cree and
Montagnais foragers) assuming that historically documented inequality is due to colonialism or
observer bias, Such attempts counterproductively ignore, explain away and/or gloss over significant
autochthonous disparities of sociocultural ‘egalitarianism’ that, in point of fact, became elaborated
in early contact times. Indeed, in fostering a new variant of individualism, colonialism simultaneously
eroded and introduced/enhanced various types of inequality that may have been far more common
than those that fit the egalitarian ideal. This can be tested archaeologically.(58)

BARRA, OCOS, AND EARLY OLMEC SOCIETIES OF COASTAL CHIAPAS, MEXICO.

Survey and excavation of Early Formative sites along the Pacific Coast of Chiapas, Mexico, during
1985, provide evidence of a continuous socio-political development from Barra through Océs to early
Olmec times (ca. 1600 B.C. to 800 B.C.). Forty new Barra, Ocds, and Cuadros phase sites were
discovered. Excavations at several of these sites allowed us to refine the characteristics and chrono-
logical placement of the three phases. An entire Océs-phase house floor and associated features were
excavated, providing details of Early Formative house styles and construction techniques. Excavation
of house floors and middens resulted in the recovery of subsistence remains—including 75,000 animal
bones and many carbonized fragments of maize, beans, and other seeds. These are the earliest culti-
vated plant remains recovered from sedentary communities in southeastern Mesoamerica.(45)

TOWARDS A BEHAVIORAL INTERPRETATION OF EARLY POSTGLACIAL HUNTER-

The archaeological record of early postglacial hunter-gatherers (10,500-6,500 B.C.) in Southern
Scandinavia is extremely rich. Yet, lacking graves and cemeteries, most information on the organi-
zation of the society has to be extracted from the settlements. Recent research has revealed a series
of analytically delineated hut floors and established the size of the minimal social unit. Further,
analysis has been carried out in search of intrasite behavioral patterns related to site use and social
dimensions. These are considered important short-term objectives for the ultimate resolution of

. settlement systems and social patterns. Results will be outlined and future prospects discussed.(44)

CHANGING ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES AND THE EARLIEST FARMING COMMUNITIES OF
THE NORTH EUROPEAN PLAIN,

The abandonment of Neolithic sites in temperate Europe is often attributed to relatively sudden
processes, such as famine, disease, or attack. Recently, archaeologists working in several parts of the
world have approached site abandonment in terms of two alternating adaptive strategies, which
Upham has termed “power” and “efficiency’’ strategies. Focusing on the Neolithic settlement at
Brzesc Kujawski (Poland) and its environs, this paper argues that its inhabitants had embarked on a
“power strategy” that eventually necessitated a shift in their approach to resource exploitation to an
“efficiency strategy” and discusses the implications of this shift for the development of the earliest
agrarian societies on the North European Plain.(16)

THE EVOLUTION OF HUNTER-GATHERER EXCHANGE ECONOMIES: SOCIAL
INTENSIFICATION IN THE NORTH COAST RANGES OF CALIFORNIA.

Throughout the 5000 year prehistory described for this portion of the North Coast Ranges, archae-
ological evidence indicates that as population numbers increased and production processes intensified,
the exchange transactions became more inclusive and began to reflect varied types of social interac
tion. The patterns depicted are consistent with the expectations of a process of political-economic
intensification and reflect changes resulting from indigenous developments and historical events.
Until recently, such a pattern of institutional growth was considered exceptional for food foragers,
but it is becoming more apparent now that prehistoric hunter-gatherers exhibited a broad range of
organizational forms. This implies that archaeologists must consider the non-egalitarian social and
political contexts, not only to evaluate the evolution of food foragers, but also to understand the
genera! development of political-economic structures.(12)

Cochabamba Valley and are radiocarbon dated to 1,000 B.C. to 600 A.D. In the Mizque Valley one
Formative sequence is cross-dated with the Cochabamba Valley. The ceramics from this zone indicate |
that during the Formative there existed localized traditions which may reflect small sociopolitical
groupings.(49}

HOLOCENE SEDIMENTS OF DAKHLEH OASIS REGION, S.C. EGYPT.

Holocene sediments of the Dakhleh Oasis region (25.5°N, 29°E) are currently grouped into six
informal stratigraphic units using sedimentological and age data. Five are aeolian and one lacustrine.
Ages come from '*C dates on ostrich eggshell from occupation sites more or less closely relatable to
sedimentary contexts, and from stylistically dated tools, pottery and structures. Aeolian units accu-
mulated in the intervals <1000, ca. 1850-1550, ca. 4200, ca. 5800-5200, and older than 7100 years BP.
, Bush, David R. 55
Lacustrine sediments, recorded only from a plateau basin, shortly pre-date 8300 years BP. A current
problem is reconciliation of faunal evidence of early/ mid-Holocene moisture with sedimentary indi-
cations of arid aeolian conditions. Another is the apparent absence of Holocene lakes from a spring:
fed lowland, 30 km from the plateau lake.(14}

INTERIOR AFRICA: CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AT 18,000 B.P,

Knowledge of hunter-gatherer populations of the African interior at 18,000 years B.P. has been
extremely limited by lack of exploration. Climatic data suggest that this ume represented the onset
of generally more arid environments in many areas and resulted in lower population densities and a
non-existent or “invisible” record of human occupation. Recent data suggest however that niver and
lakeshore areas, especially in central Africa, may have been intensively utilized as early as the last
glacial maximum.(20)

SAN MIGUEL VIEJO, MPIO. ALLENDE, GUANAJUATO, MEXICO.

The “Proyecto Piloto del Acias Arqueologico”’ identified San Miguel Viejo as the regional center in
the middle rio Laja. The site 1s clearly Mesoamencan with its truncated pyramids, sunken patios,
plazas, altars and terraces. Superficial analysis of the ceramics and architecture indicate that the site
was occupied between 600-950 AD; or, the apogee of Teotihuacan and the rise of Tula. As such San
Miguel Viejo’s decline probably corresponds to the initial Chichimec invasions of Central Mexico.
During the winter 1986/7 the “Museo Casa Allende” undertook a salvage operation on part of the
site to clarify the local chronology and analyze the habitational patterns.(30)

LONG DISTANCE EXCHANGE IN THE LATE FORMATIVE ECUADORIAN HIGHLANDS.
Ongoing excavations at Pirincay, a Late Formative site in the southern Ecuadorian highlands,
suggest that long distance exchange was an integral part of Ecuadorian economies by the mid-first
millennium B.C. However organized, this trade seems to have involved large scale specialist manu-
facture of sumptuary items, and movement of both finished products and raw materials between the
highlands, the coast and the tropical forest as well as between the intermontane basins. Suggestions
concerming the importance of east-west running river valleys as trans-andean corridors would seem
to be validated for this time period.(28)

THE SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE BATTEN KILL PHASE IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO.

A rigorous quantitative methodology is defined in order to uncover spatial variation of the diagnostic
artifact of the Batten Kill phase, the Genesee projectile point. In a multivariate analysis of 37 design
variables on several hundred Genesee points, evidence 1s presented which supports statistically
significant regional vanation of shoulder and stem elements of this artifact. This variation 1s found
to cluster in 10 regions in Southern Ontario and is interpreted as representing discrete hunting
ranges.(34)

CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT STUDIES ON SURFACE MINING PROJECTS—
EXAMPLES FROM OHIO AND KENTUCKY.

Recent policy changes by the State Regulatory Authority in Ohio have resulted in the first cultural
resource studies being conducted on proposed surface mining permit areas. Since the fall of 1985,
thousands of acres have been surveyed resulting in the identification of many significant archaeolog-
ical sites. Kentucky's State Regulatory Authority has yet to require CRM studies on proposed surface
mining permit areas. This paper compares the findings in Ohio with those from surveys in Kentucky
(surveys conceming land exchanges between the Daniel Boone National Forest and coal companies)
emphasizing the success that can be gained.|18)

INFERRING SITE FUNCTION, SEASONALITY, AND BUTCHERING PATTERNS WITH
SALMONID REMAINS.

Most previous treatments of archaeological salmonid remains in the Pacific Northwest use faunal
data to address subsistence issues. The ubiquity of such remains in northwestern sites, however,
suggests they have great potential to inform on site function, seasonality of use, and butchering
patterns, much as bison remains have been successfully employed in other areas of the western United
States. This paper demonstrates how element survivorship, specimen dispersion, bone fragmentation,
size class, and species composition may be used to identify site function, seasonality, and butchering
patterns through discussion of the salmonid remains from a Puget Sound shell midden, the Duwamish
No. 1 Site.(25}

THE REORGANIZATION OF POLITICAL CONTROL IN THE TILANTONGO VALLEY FROM
FORMATIVE TO POSTCLASSIC TIMES.

Changes in the distribution of settlements in the Tilantongo Valley from Formative to Postclassic
times suggest two major reorganizations of political control in this part of Oaxaca. Explanation of
these transitions can be sought through an examination of changing patterns of conflict and alliance
within the Mixteca Alta and of changing interaction with the valley of Oaxaca, Ceramic and settle-
ment pattern analyses are employed to simultaneously examine the local and regional sources of
change in the context of tremendous political upheaval depicted in the Mixtec historical codices
during these periods.

SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE LBK VILLAGE OF DARION (BELGIUM),

The LBK village of Darion dated at about 6200 B.P. covers some 2 ha. It is surrounded by a ditch
and a palisade with 3 main entrances. The interior space is divided in two zones, The largest one has
no houses and contains only a few pits. Some of these pits yield specialized material such as flint
waste from the preparation of blades, indicating that flint knapping took place in that part of the
dwelling. The southern zone comprises 4 houses surrounded by numerous rubbish pits. Palynological
analysis demonstrates that the northern zone is devoted to pasture while the southern one is almost
devoid of vegetation. Cereal fields extend along the western and southern sides of the village, between
the houses and the southern part of the palisade. Pedological studies demonstrate that the neolithic

site is located on a pedological margin, a situation which apparently is often selected by LBK peoples
in Belgium. The spatial organization of the Darion village presents several similarities with that of
the much moere-extended and more densely constructed LBK village of K6In-Lindenthal, in Germany.
Both are fortified sites with an interior opposition between a constructed southern part and a northern
part devoid of habitation.(44)

LOCAL RESOURCE SELECTION - CONNECTICUT BASALTS.

For 8,000 years, inhabitants of the Connecticut and Farmington River valleys have utilized locally
available basalt for making stone tools. The only sources of basalt in Connecticut are a volcanic ridge
and its associated dikes and sills in the central part of the state. The ridge is composed of three
separate lava flows which can be distinguished morphologically and by trace element analysis.
Country rock and metamorphosed sediments are additional resources utilized by local inhabitants.

The question of preference and special selection of certain basalts and contact-metamorphosed rock
as raw material for stone tools will be discussed.(31)

THE TEMPORAL DIMENSION IN THE ANALYSIS OF STYLE.

The study of temporal changes in the frequency and variety of material culture styles is a key to
understanding the processes of socioeconomic change. The development sequence of temporal change
is also the context necessary for establishing the meaning of synchronic stylistic variability. A
temporal perspective is especially critical for interpreting the use of material culture as a medium for
the expression of individual identity and social status, The significance of time in the study of style
is illustrated through the examination of variability in nineteenth century English grave monu-
ments.(32)

PREHISTORIC EXCHANGE ON THE NORTHWEST COAST.

Trade in obsidian both along the coast and between the coast and the interior can be documented
for the last 8000-9000 years. Exchange of other commodities—quartz crystals, soapstone, nephrite,
dentalium and ceremonial! objects—is only known from about 3000 B.P. The archaeological record is
non-specific concerning the mechanisms of exchange. However, the overall patterning of Northwest
Coast society seems to have changed little during the last 3000 years preceding contact, and those
historically known mechanisms of exchange based on seasonal mobility and reciprocal obligations
between kin groups probably go back at least that far.(40)

INTERPRETING ARTIFACT CLUSTERS AROUND HEARTHS AT PINCEVENT HABITATION

Artifact clusters around hearths can indicate numerous past activities and formation processes.
Assigning appropriate meaning to them requires that site-specific evidence derived through explor-

among artifacts and features, including asymmetry patterns within polythetic depositional sets,
cluster shape, border characteristics, and size, artifact conjoin patterns, and stratigraphy are examined

THE ROLE OF QUARRY UTILIZATION IN PALEOINDIAN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS.

In eastern North America there are two views concerning the significance of lithic resources in the
Paleoindian seasonal round. The traditional model argues that annual movements involved traveling
between quarries separated by hundreds of miles. In contrast data from the Flint Run Complex suggests
that seasonal movements centered around one quarry and band territories were relatively small. The
reduction sequence and other site activities from the Shoop site will be compared to sites from the
Flint Run Complex to further investigate the role of quarry sites in the Paleoindian seasonal round.(46)

THE SCAVENGING HYPOTHESIS REVISITED, OR, PUTTING “MAN” BACK IN EARLY MAN
STUDIES.

Replication of Binford’s work as described in Bones: Ancient Men and Modern Myths shows that
his analyses have problems. Prominent among these are: 1) the smal! number and inappropriate nature
of the comparative actualistic studies used and, 2) less than rigorous statistical treatment of the data.
When these flaws are considered, claims concerning the contributions of non-hominid agents to early
man sites appear greatly weakened if not wholly unsupported. However, Binford’s aims and approaches
are still an important step which should be followed up by more ngorous studies and compared to
actualistic analyses such as Hill's (1975) work on East African vertebrate taphonomy.(32}

THE VISIBILITY OF PASTORAL SITES: AN ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL CASE FROM GREECE.

Recently archaeologists have noted the difficulty of locating and identifying pastoral sites during
regional surveys. This paper argues that the invisibility of pastoral sites stems from inadequacies in
conceptual and methodological frameworks used to reconstruct prehistoric pastoralism. It has been
assume? that highly mobile pastoral populations left only ephemeral evidence on the cultural land-
seape. Also, zooarchaeological approaches to pastoralism have been considered the most appropriate
methods for analyzing pastoral production. Such assumptions have caused archaeologists to overlook
the pastoral site as a useful unit of analysis. Ethnoarchaeological observations of modern pastoral

A THEORY OF ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE BURDEN OF HISTORY.

A theory of archaeology (and history) must encompass the transition from non-human to human
as well as the rise of the agricultural state. The focus of the theory must be on change, not subject
matter, analogous to the manner in which Darwinian theory can accommodate any grade of biological
complexity. Neither the New Archaeology, grounded in a simplistic application of evolutionary theory
to socio-cultural phenomena, nor a recent alternative derived from post-Marxist structuralism have
sufficient scope. A broader theory of change appreciating the historical constraints on operational
configurations and incorporating the role of ideology is presented.(32)

ROUTES OF TRADE AND COMMUNICATION AND THE INTEGRATION OF MAYA SOCIETY:
THE VISTA FROM SANTA RITA COROZAL, BELIZE.

Santa Rita Corozal is juxtaposed between the New and Hondo Rivers and Chetumal Bay, This
location in northern Belize allowed access to both sea and riverine trade. Santa Rita Corozal floresced
during the Early Classic and late Postclassic, two areas characterized by external influences and/or
trade. While river and ocean routes may be used to predict trade, such routes are also indicative of
general networks of communication. The use and nonuse of such routes throughout the prehistory
of Santa Rita reveals the site’s changing role in wider Maya culture.(47)

COAL MINING AND ARCHAEOLOGY: OSMRE’S VIEW.

The Office of Surface Mining recently promulgated regulations on the protection of historic resources

during coal mining operations. Archaeologists and the public can influence how archaeological resources

_are treated during mine permitting. However, permits are generally issued by State regulating author-

ities, and Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act does not apply directly to permit

issuance. Archaeologists seem to be having a hard time interacting effectively with State mining

WHAT'S IT A PICTURE OF? IDENTIFYING PREHISTORIC PICTURES IN THE SOUTHERN

ALPS.

Identifying the subjects depicted in rock art is an intractable problem, even if they sometimes seem
‘obvious’ at first glance. A two-dimensional picture is a representational depiction insofar as it
reproduces the characteristic shape of its subject, so grammatical analysis of the geometry of the
picture and its comparison with the three dimensional geometry of the possible subject indicates if
the identification is likely to be correct, and what confidence can be placed in it. The method is
developed with, and illustrated by, the ‘prehistoric maps’, supposed plans of prehistoric villages,
which have been identified in the rock art of alpine France and Italy.(38)

the flow of traffic and to limit access to particular parts of the compound. Hypotheses generated from

Based on survey work carried out in 1981, 1984, and 1986, a model for upland (over 200 m ASL)
land use in the extinct Norse Wester Settlement is presented. Seasonal caribou hunting and some
sheep and goat herding appear to be the extent of Norse exploitation of the upper elevations. This
pattern contrasts with data collected in the larger Eastern Settlement to the south, and with current
models for medieval shielding activity in continental Scandinavia. Ecological and demographic factors
are proposed to account for these differences.(21}

THE SANSHAN SITE: A NEWLY DISCOVERED UPPER PALEOLITHIC SITE ON THE EAST

The Sanshan site is located on a small island (2 km?) in Taihu Lake, the third largest freshwater
lake in China, not far from Shanghai. Over 5,000 stone artifacts and some 20 species of mammalian
fossils were recovered from the site. The fossils indicate that during the terminal Pleistocene, the

Yantze River delta and Taihu Lake area was a wooded grassland dotted with small lakes and streams,
frequented by animals and human groups. Artifacts of the Sanshan assemblage exhibit technological
and typological attributes that have not been observed among Upper Paleolithic sites in the loess

in different environmental niches of the terminal Pleistocene in China.(20)

COLONIZATION.

In order to better understand Polynesian settlement, we must go beyond variables such as population

of Polynesia, and in subsequent sociocultural development. The focus of the study is on the paradig-

| matic themes of “the stranger chief” and “junior usurpation of power,” and how these models for
behavior stimulated the settlement of the Polynesian Islands.(55)

DOMINATION, RESISTANCE, AND MEANING IN THE CEMETERY.

Recent discussions of ideology in archaeology have treated ideology as an instrumentalist phenom-
enon, where ideology is seen aS a means by which an elite group dominates subordinates. Studies of
the 19th and 20th century cemeteries in Broom County, New York challenge this perspective. It is
suggested that ideology is a much more complex phenomenon. A dominant ideology is evident in the
cemeteries; however, this ideology is not uniform or unchallenged. The ideology documented in the
cemeteries also expresses competition between different elite groups and the resistance of the working
class.(29)

The chronology of Great Lakes area rock art relies on a variety of techniques. The pictographs
attributed to the historic and prehistoric Ojibwa can be dated by several methods: (1) the geomor-
phological position of many sites on recent shorelines; (2) panels dated through native oral history
and motifs; (3) artifact associations; (4) relative dating by superimposed pictographs; and (5) cross-
dating to portable art objects. Examples of each method and appropriate sites will be illustrated. The
rock art tradition that is currently dated by these methods spans the Woodland era from 500 B.C. to

The evolutionarily conservative land snails of the Family Bulimulidae have made remarkable
adaptations to maritime desert environments of extreme aridity along the coasts of Peru and Chile.
Several genera and species are reported from archaeological contexts where their presence often has
been mis-interpreted. Research on population dynamics, dispersal mechanisms, estivation rates, and
ranges, provides new insights into paleoenvironmental reconstructions of habitats below 2800 m.
Extinct species involved in ceremonialism and long-distance trade are identified and discussed.(6)

THE HOHOKAM COLONIAL EXPANSION: A TUCSON BASIN PERSPECTIVE.

The late Pioneer/early Colonial periods witnessed the first widespread appearance of the Hohokam
in go outside the Phoenix Basin “core” region. This so-called ‘Colonial Expansion” has traditionally
been explained in terms of a migration model. An alternative model has also been proposed, one that
views diffusion and exchange rather than population movement as the chief mechanisms by which
Hohokam traits spread. These models are critically evaluated in light of data obtained from recent
excavations at AZ AA:16:49 (ASM), a large ballcourt village in the southern Tucson Basin.(51)

THE ROLE OF ETHNIC AFFILIATION IN INTERREGIONAL INTERACTION IN NORTHERN
HONDURAS.

Researchers in Honduras have suggested that interregional interaction was promoted or facilitated
by the activities of diverse ethnic groups, or by the manipulation of ethnic ties by individuals who
mediated transactions between different regions. Recent research in the Sula Valley shows that ethnic
affiliation may provide a model for interregional contacts although archaeological verification of the
model has been fraught with difficulties. Using data from the Sula Valley during the period from A.D.
600-900, an archaeological example of the role of ethnic affiliation in interregional interaction is
developed.(8)

Survey and excavation data from over 200 coastal and riverine sites in the Karluk, Spiridon, Uyak,
and Uganik drainages are synthesized. Settlement size, location, spacing, and seasonality are correlated
with significant intra-regional resource variations, particularly along the dimension of salmon vs. sea

| mammal-based subsistence systems. Temporal increase in house and village sizes is discussed (through
the Ocean Bay, Kachemak, and Koniag phases). Comparisons are drawn between the study area and
other parts of the northern Pacific (Aleutians, NW Coast) where complex hunter-gatherer societies
developed.(7)

CONVERGENCE IN CERAMIC MANUFACTURING TRADITIONS IN THE LATE
PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST.

The Salado Polychromes are among the most widely distributed ceramic types in the prehistoric
Southwestern United States. Manufactured between A.D. 1300 and 1450, the distribution of the
ceramics has long been attributed to exchange from a single region in central Arizona. Instrumental
Neutron Activation Analysis of 200 samples of Gila Polychrome from 22 sites spread throughout the
Southwest suggests local manufacture of the material, making this the only known type to have been
manufactured in an area crosscutting most recognized Southwestern cultural boundaries. Ongoing
whole vessel analysis reveals considerable uniformity in technology and styles of design despite the
widespread area of manufacture,(50)

TOWARD A DEFINITION OF COMPLEXITY: SOME BURGUNDIAN PUZZLES.

The argument that society becomes increasingly complex underlies widespread acceptance of the
dominant (cultural evolutionary) paradigm of the emergence of ranked society. Much recent analysis
however, has yielded evidence which is difficult to either describe or explain under the umbrella of a
model based on a term which remains largely undefined. Three examples from Burgundy of economic,
social, and administrative complexity are examined and their relation to the concept of ranking
explored. Particular attention will be paid to the ability of cultural evolutionists to effectively model
these relations. An alternative, heterarchical model of social complexity 1s proposed.(48}

PATTERNS IN PETROGLYPHS AND IN CERAMICS OF THE LOWER SUSQUEHANNA VALLEY,
DELAWARE.

The petroglyphs of the lower Susquehanna Valley, Delaware, have been the focus of archaeological
interest for more than 100 years; early studies provided a catalogue of the designs before they were
flooded by hydroelectric dams. Recent analysis of the petroglyphs shows that they are located on the
border of the Minguannon and Shenks Ferry/Susquehannock archaeological complexes. Design rules
can be discerned from analysis of the petroglyphs, and similarities between petroglyphs design-rules
and local ceramic design-rules are present. These similarities suggest a late prehistoric age for the
petroglyphs, which may have functioned as markers of cultural and ethnic boundaries.(38)

DETERMINING SUBSURFACE SITE BOUNDARIES AT HOHOKAM SITES BY INTENSIVE

Determining subsurface feature distribution is a problem in excavation planning, ITR was developed
as a survey/testing tool to aid in excavation planning, and is based on the co-occurrence of major

Project, but only recently could ITR be tested by extensive excavation. The utility, application, and

THE MURPHY SITE (33-Li-212): A MIDDLE WOODLAND SETTLEMENT IN CENTRAL OHIO.

Systematic surface collection and excavation of the Murphy site in Licking County, Ohio, have
produced a sample of core-and-blade debitage, cut mica fragments, and plain, grit tempered ceramics
which, along with radiocarbon dates ranging from 90 B.C. to A.D. 210, suggest a Middle Woodland
occupation. The 1.5 ha site contains post mold and pit features which appear to be the remains of a
hamlet type settlement. Archacobotanical samples from the features include cultigens of the Eastern
Agricultural Complex. One of the most completely investigated Middle Woodland sites in the Middle
Ohio Valley, the Murphy site promises to shed light on a variety of questions concerning Hopewellian
settlement pattern, subsistence, and inter-regional cultural interaction.(10)

LIMITATIONS ON THE INTERPRETATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL WOOD CHARCOAL.

The interpretive potential of archaeological wood charcoal is limited with respect to both general
palaeoecological studies and attempts to assess human impact on local vegetation. Regardless of
whether wood charcoal species composition in an archaeological context is quantified by the number
of fragments recovered or the absolute weight per taxon, the results do not reflect local forest species
composition at the time of deposition, There are many factors involved in the acquisition of wood
and its subsequent deposition and preservation as wood charcoal on archaeological sites. The presence
of certain taxa is the only sound criterion for the interpretation of wood charcoal samples. Charcoal
materials recovered from Northern Algeria will be discussed as an example of this approach.(43)

THE ORGANIZATION OF A SUWANNEE TECHNOLOGY: THE VIEW FROM HARNEY FLATS.

This paper presents the results of a lithic analysis performed on a large {1.35 ha) stratified early man
(Suwannee) site located near Tampa, Florida. Excavations conducted in 1981-82 covered 967 sq m and
focused on block excavations in three sub-areas of the site. Various tool types from a large Suwannee
assemblage (over 1000 tools) are discussed from a technological organization perspective—understand-
ing why certain tool designs were created and how these designs were implemented within the
settlement system. In addition a chert source identification study was performed on the stone tool
assemblage and the implications of these results are also presented.(46)

CENTRAL ASIAN HUNTER-GATHERERS AT THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM.

There is little evidence for human occupation of the Afghan-Tadzhik depression, the Kyzyl Kum,
the Kara Kum or the Caspian shore of Central Asia during the last half of the Wurm. The leading
hypothesis for this hiatus in the archaeological record is that the increasing cold and arid conditions
of the glacial maximum rendered the Central Asian middle latitude steppe environment beyond the
adaptive limits of the local Upper Paleolithic populations. Available environmental, subsistence-
technological, chronological, and settlement history data are not sufficient to reject the climatic
hypothesis at present,(20)

ETHNOHISTORY AND SOUTHERN SAN ROCK ENGRAVINGS.

, Deller, D. Brian 65
engravings in the northem Cape Province provide a unique testing ground because, first, there is a
greater potential for relative dating of engravings than is the case with paintings. Second, there are
ethnographic records for the northern Cape that relate to the belief system of the /Xam San of the
late 19th century that have relevance for the interpretation of the themes in the engravings. Third,
these records suggest that there were at least two and possibly more dialect groups in the region,
which allows for the investigation of inter-group variability in rock art content, style and related
stone artifact assemblages. Some characteristics are shown to be site-specific, others are group specific,
end others are common to all sites in the region.(38)

HOUSEHOLD POTTERY STORAGE AND SITE STRUCTURE; A VIEW FROM THE MAYA
HIGHLANDS. |

Separate and distinct storage strategies are associated with pottery production, consumption, and
disposal within the Maya household. This is true of general domestic and ritual vessel use, as well as
pottery manufacturing activities and the placement of broken vessels for future reuse (elsewhere
termed provisional discard). In this context, storage behavior is viewed as having an influential role
in the “evolution” of pottery assemblages within ongoing households. Further, remnants of certain
yesse! storage configurations are likely to survive in archaeological situations and may be confused
with household activity areas.(27)

AFRO-AMERICAN CERAMIC PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN THE VIRGINIA
TIDEWATER.

Analysis of pipestem fragments from a series of sites at Flowerdew Hundred, Virginia, using
Harrington's histograms, shows three distinct settlement modes between the early 17th and early
19th centuries. The earliest reflects the depression of the tobacco economy; the second, the rise of an
incipient elite based on slavery in the late 17th century, and the third represents settlers who had a
stronger commitment to the land prior to slavery. Slave-manufactured pottery appears only on sites
of the latest group, although there was a black presence at Flowerdew from 1619. This seeming
contradiction may be a function of architectural changes reflecting a great break in servant - planter
relations, and might also explain differences in slave pottery from Virginia and South Carolina.(29)

THE ROLE OF MARRIAGE NETWORKS IN STRUCTURING GREAT BASIN SETTLEMENT
PATTERNS.

Differences between regional settlement patterns across the Great Basin are often taken to reflect
variations in local environment, particularly the availability of subsistence resources. Similar envi-
ronmental settings can, however, support divergent settlement patterns. This suggests a complex
relationship between environment, subsistence, and settlement patterns. Comparison of prehistonc
settlement patterns between Deep Springs and Owens Valley, California, which share many similar-
ses in environment, indicates that the size of local population and the resulting marriage network
plays an important role in linking settlement strategies to local environment.(51)

SHIFTING SPATIAL SCALES IN STUDIES OF MAYA SETTLEMENT AND POLITICS.

Interesting methodological and theoretical issues arise when selecting scales of study for under-
standing Maya settlement and political structure. In particular, selecting a small scale of study (house
groups - households) and extrapolating to comment on larger scale problems {involving sites and
regions - communities and polities) falls into a reductionist trap. As illustration, implications of
shifting scale when studying the locus and determinants of residential decision-making are examined,
with primary reference to Classic Maya settlement and politics from the Rosario Valley, Chiapas,
Mexico.(45)

FACTORS CONDITIONING THE PLACEMENT OF FIRE-RELATED FACILITIES AND REFUSE.

Ethnographic and archaeological research demonstrates that sedentary societies position fires and

‘ dispose of their byproducts in spatially diverse ways. Recent site structural studies make it possible
to begin understanding why such variable arrangements occur. Data gathered among the Guarijia of
northwestern Mexico, who employ at least eight different kinds of firemaking facilities, suggest that
several spatial determinants are involved. These include climatic conditions, type of architecture,
activity structure, and other considerations. Insights derived from observation of the Guarijio are
used to forge an explanation for some cross-cultural differences and similarities.(27)

MICROWEAR ANALYSIS IN THE STUDY OF CURATED AND EXPEDIENT TECHNOLOGIES

IN THE ITALIAN UPPER PALEOLITHIC, |

Operationalizing complex theoretical concepts such as curation and expediency as they pertain to
Paleolithic stone tool assemblages is difficult. One problem is that archaeologists often use data such
as formal characteristics of stone tools whose relationship to these concepts is ambiguous at best. A
method is proposed whereby indications of such human behavior with respect to stone tools are
deduced. These deduced properties are recognizable through microwear analysis, especially in asso-
ciation with technomorphological study. Comparison of assemblages can then provide some relative
measure of curational behavior as exemplified by analysis of Epigravettian assemblages from Paglicci
Cave and Petriolo III South, Italy.(9)

latest suite of sixteen dates from the Coso Range. The cation dates suggest a very lengthy tradition
of ritual activity that extends back into Palaeo-Indian times.(35)

AN OBSIDIAN DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR THE BELIZE PERIPHERY.

Trace element studies of obsidian from Belize sites suggest several interesting patterns related to
diachronic distribution patterns and use of coastal networks for transport of trade items. Obsidian
from the El Chayal source, previously believed to be distributed by inland routes during the Classic
Period, was in fact distributed as early as the Late Preclassic by coastal networks along with obsidians
trom the Ixtepeque source. A regionalized obsidian distribution pattern for the relatively autonomous
Belize periphery differs somewhat from the trade models previously established by Nelson and
Hammond for the Maya lowlands.(47)

THE TEHUACAN VALLEY AND THE TEOTIHUACAN OBSIDIAN INDUSTRY.

Commerce, especially involving exportation of obsidian, is often assigned a major position in the
economy of classic period Teotihuacan, with Teotihuacan sometimes seen as monopolizing obsidian
erade throughout Mesoamerica. Proponents of such models cite evidence that obsidian from sources
near Teotihuacan appeared in distant regions. Patterns of obsidian procurement in the Tehuacan
Valley during the Formative and Classic, however, are inconsistent with such a view. They suggest
that. to the extent that Teotihuacan’s obsidian industry produced for export, the major objective was
not profit in any meaningful sense, but the acquisition of luxury goods from great distances.(11)

GRAVITY ANALYSIS AND SETTLEMENT BOUNDARIES: INTERCENTER INTERACTION IN

A gravity model from economic geography is adapted to archaeological settlement. Assuming flat
terrain, it projects intercenter boundaries based on site sizes and intersite distance. This model is
applied to Nimli Punit and Xnaheb, Belize, neighboring cities of the Lowland Maya from the Late
Classic (A.D. 700-900). Field mapping of those cities confirms the great potential of such simulations
in predicting settlement dropoffs, clarifying intercenter interaction, and highlighting nongravitational
influences on settlement patterns. The intersite boundary was accurately located, however, it was
strongly affected by topographic variation, and the two cities proved to be poorly integrated, suggesting
relative underdevelopment.(45)

MEASUREMENT AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL USE OF SEDIMENT pH.

Sediment pH is an easily measured property of demonstrated value to archaeological prospection,

how details of sample preparation and measurement may introduce extraneous variation. Examples
of the use of pH data are drawn from research in Kentucky, Missouri, and Washington. pH determines
many kinds of chemical reactions and reaction rates. Understanding the contemporary content of the
archaeological record requires the documentation of archaeological pH.(43)

THE RISE OF COMPLEX SOCIETIES IN ITALY: HISTORICAL VERSUS NON-HISTORICAL

an independent historical reconstruction. With both societies, an abundant archaeological record
allows another independent reconstruction. Focusing on one question, the evolution of Roman set-

collection and use of archaeological material, prevent its independent use and distort the reconstruc-
tion of social and economic processes active in a complex society’s rise and fall. Concluding arguments
will be made about the need to use archaeology as a primary source even in literate societies.(48)

RURALIZATION.

Early urbanization, exemplified prototypically in southern Mesopotamia, involved population growth
and nucleation. However, archaeologically inconspicuous village communities are neglected, and
thereby rendered virtually “invisible,” when urbanization is assumed to be normal in complex
societies. Settlement patterns in Palestine/Transjordan show that the appearance of Bronze Age towns
was paralleled by a more significant proliferation of villages. A case study from the Jordan Valley
demonstrates that villages performed functions often assumed to be urban: for example, providing
access to specialized goods and services. It is argued that secondary developments of complex society
may involve growth through “ruralization,” rather than “urbanization.'’(24}

LEAD ISOTOPE EVIDENCE FOR MINERAL DEPOSIT SOURCES OF GALENA FROM SOME
MIDDLE WOODLAND AND MISSISSIPPIAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN THE

_ SOUTHEASTERN U.S.

We have undertaken a series of lead isotope ratio measurements on a representative suite of galenas
found in middle Woodland and Mississippian grave sites in Alabama and Tennessee to test the
applicability of this technique for determining the provenance of the samples. Comparison of the data
for the grave site samples with that for galenas from potential mineral source areas in the Upper
Mississippi valley, Missouri, and Tennessee suggest that the sources of most of the archaeological
galenas lie in the southeast/central Missouri Pb-Zn mineral district. Ten to twenty percent appear to
originate in the Upper Mississippi Valley region.(10)

LATE WOODLAND CULTIVATED PLANT RECORD IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO.

Five cultivated plants (corn, bean, squash, sunflower and tobacco) are known from ethnographic
and archaeological sources to have been grown prehistorically in southern Ontario. The time period
during which cultigens were introduced into and spread throughout southern Ontario extends from
A.D. 600 to A.D. 1650. On the basis of available evidence the two earliest sites date to around A.D.
600 and have only corn. They are the Princess Point site in the city of Hamilton at the western end
of Lake Ontario and the Dawson Creek site near Rice Lake in south central Ontario. Tobacco appears
for the first time in the 8th century on a Princess Point site in the Grand River area. Beans, squash
and sunflower are all introduced by Younge Tradition people in the southwest during the 11th century.
The diffusion of cultivated plants appears to be from the south, to the east and later north.(33)

FROM FRONTIER TO SEMI-PERIPHERY: PREHISPANIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE
EJUTLA REGION, OAXACA, MEXICO.

Preliminary results from the settlement pattern survey of the Ejutla Valley, Oaxaca, Mexico indicate
that this marginal area was inhabited later and somewhat more sparsely than the Valley of Oaxaca
proper. Coincident with Monte Alban expansion outside of the Valley core, major shifts in the
distributions of regional population and civic/ceremonial architecture are noted in Ejutla as the area
was transformed from a frontier to a semi-periphery. A second significant restructuring occurred in
the Ejutla region following the fall of Monte Alban when there is evidence of decentralization and
sncreased military activities along the region's southern edge.(5)

ALGONQUIAN ORIGINS: A PROBLEM IN LINGUISTIC-ARCHAEOLOGICAL CORRELATION.

Most archaeologists currently assume continuous, indigenous development of North-eastern cul-
cures. This model is incompatible with linguists’ model of migration of Proto-Algonquians from a
homeland near Lake Ontario, ca. 3000-2000 B.P. Attempted identifications of Paleo-Indian or Archaic
assemblages as Proto-Algonquian are seriously flawed. Significant discontinuities in the archaeolog-
ical record of the Early and Middle Woodland periods offer a better context for hypothesized Algon-
quian expansion.(22)

THRESHOLDS TO GROUP FISSIONING AMONG HUNTER-GATHERERS.

Group composition among hunter-gatherers generally has been seen as resulting from demographic
or ecological variables. What these models have failed to consider is the contribution that social
processes make to group composition. One of the factors that determines group composition is the
facility with which a group can fission. Social processes that actively promote or retard fission do so
by decreasing the likelihood of group autonomy or by enhancing group cohesion, thereby contributing
to the development of social inequalities. The utility of this approach is investigated by examining
archaeological materials from the Early Woodland period in southern New England.(58)

PERCEPTION AND SCALE IN THE EVALUATION OF DISPERSED PHENOMENA.

Perception and scale proved to be critical factors in recognizing constituent units and overall
configuration of multi-site communities in dispersed Hohokam settlement patterns of southern
Arizona, Settlement systems deriving major subsistence from valley slopes contrast with expectations
based on better known riverine irrigation networks. Large scale full coverage survey was necessary to
effectively define land-extensive production complexes and to detect community boundaries within
mon-compact settlement distributions. Results have implications for recovering and evaluating spa-
tially dispersed phenomena in general.(24)

MEASURING CHANGE IN SHELLFISH RESOURCES.

Abundant shellfish remains in coastal middens provide an unparalleled source of data for measuring
the impact of human subsistence strategies upon prey populations, Such research is based on the
sssumption that trends in shell size are directly related to collection strategies. A shell midden on
, 72 Fox, William A.
San Juan Island, WA (research sponsored by U. of WA and hosted by National Park Service) provides
large samples of clam shells from separate archaeological deposits. The shells from each deposit vary
in mean size, and size-frequency distributions vary in shape (modality). Because different factors (the
prey population, the environment, the method of collection and transport) may produce the same
size-frequency distribution, the shell measurements do not provide the direct archaeological infor-
mation expected. If these factors can be distinguished, the size of shells from archaeological deposits
can provide information about subsistence strategies.|25)

LOOTING AND LEGISLATION IN ONTARIO.

. Clandestine excavation of archaeological sites for the purpose of cuno collecting has occurred in
Ontario since at least the early 19th century. The first recorded digging involved Middle Woodland
burial mounds in the Hamilton vicinity; numerous Huron ossuaries were also looted in Simcoe
County. It was not until 1953 that Ontario passed the Archacological Sites Protection Act, but little
real protection was afforded until the Ontario Heritage Act came into effect in 1974. The first
prosecution for archaeological site looting occurred in 1985 and was upheld in an appeal to the
Provincial Court. A concluding review of the present state of archaeological site looting and artifact
sale is presented.({2)

WASTE NOT - WANT NOT? ORGANIZATIONAL ASPECTS OF LITHIC TECHNOLOGICAL
SYSTEMS IN THE BIGHORN MOUNTAINS OF WYOMING.

The terms ‘curated’ versus ‘expedient’ have been widely used in discussions of lithic data, and their
use has provoked considerable debate in the archaeological literature, Curation and expediency, in
and of themselves, have no explanatory power. They are terms used to characterize certain types of
behaviors observable in the archaeological record. The potential utility of these terms is evident when
the underlying factors contributing to these behaviors are examined. Data from the Bighorn Mountains
are used to demonstrate how availability and accessibility of raw materials relate to differential
treatment of the material in the technological system.{9}

TEOTIHUACAN AND WESTERN YUCATAN EXCHANGE.

Western Yucatan has a major interchange with the Mexican highlands beginning in the early Middle
Classic and continues into the Late Classic. Recent research on Teotihuacan’s culture indicates it
had the greatest exchange with this area. The exchange is reflected in both architecture and art.
Influence first appears in the northwestem area of the Yucatan peninsula at such sites as Ake, Izamal,
Dzibilchaltun and Acanceh. Evidence is presented from several sites including Uxmal, Kabah and
Oxkintok. A chronological realignment of architectural traits of Puuc sites supports such contact
from Teotihuacan.({1 1}

THE ORIGIN OF MAYA CEREMONIAL LITHIC ARTIFACTS.

The “eccentrics” of the southern Maya lowlands are problematic. Previously considered to be the
result of diffusion from Teotihuacan in the Early Classic, evidence from northem Belize conclusively
shows that ceremonial lithics developed locally in the Late Preclassic. Apparently, full-time intensive
lithic craft specialization emerged as a response to a change in agricultural technology. Later, as a
result of improved skills and technological innovations developed by these specialists, an elaborate
system of votive lithic artifacts became an integral part of regional ceremonialism. Such skill in lithic
technology was never surpassed in prehistory.(45)

POVERTY POINT TRADE AND THE ARCHAIC-WOODLAND TRANSITION,

Fresh data and powerful analytical models are casting new light on Lower Mississippi Valley trade
during the Archaic-Woodland transition between 2500 and 800 B.C. Previous conclusions regarding
the importance of foreign and local industrial raw materials and the primacy of the Poverty Point site
have been reaffirmed. However, instead of a single long-lasting exchange system, a more complicated
picture involving several localized networks centered around large strategically located villages now
seems indicated. While fulfilling basic domestic needs, it appears that some materials, especially
exotics, were not uniformly accessible and may, at the Poverty Point site, have led to institutionalized
inequalities.|40)

A PREHISTORIC FRONTIER IN THE PRAIRIE PENINSULA; LATE WOODLAND UPLAND
SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS.

The 700 year “hiatus” between Hopewell and Mississippian is interpreted using a pioneer settlement
model. Immediately upon the Hopewell demise Late Woodland groups began intensive use of previ-
ously unoccupied upland headwater areas in the Prairie Peninsula. Early Late Woodland pioneers
retained traditional nucleated villages and dependence on aquatic and riverine resources. Later pioneer
stages were characterized by a successful upland-oriented economy based on individual household

rather than village level organization. This pattern prevailed for about 400 years. Maintenance of
distinct ethnic group boundaries and structured contacts among neighboring groups assisted in pioneer
groups’ survival until the arrival of Mississippian influences.(10)

Early colonial documents for the Huanuco region provide testimony to the character of provincial
Inka governance of the region. But beyond the large administrative center of Huanuco Pampa, archae-
ological evidence for the Inka conquest 1s minimal in the villages of the region. The scarcity of
observable Inka traits in ceramics, architecture, and settlement pattern suggests a low level of inter-
action between conqueror and conquered. However, this archaeological reconstruction must be eval-
uated in light of the colonial evidence. Together they provide an outline of the character of provincial
Inka influence and suggest new approaches in searching archaeologically for evidence of the impact
of the Inka.(41)}

size and mobility in the Siwa Oasis region. The results indicate a small regional population composed
of several bands. Seasonal availability of resources and water in the desert surrounding the oases
apparently led to excursions into the desert during the rainy season and reoccupation of sites around

permanent water holes during the dry season.|14)

DIFFICULTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL

While the potential applications of organic residue analysis are exciting, major problems exist with
the use of this type of analysis as part of an archaeological evaluation. These are due to the fact that

often in an altered and/or degraded state. How these factors complicate a residue recovery analysis
and identification will be illustrated from the author's experience with blood residue detection.(15)

HOLOCENE AND LATE PLEISTOCENE CHRONOLOGY IN THE WESTERN DESERT AND THE
NILE VALLEY OF EGYPT.

Conventional radiocarbon dating has been used to determine paleoclimatic variations and to study
prehistoric activity of man. The earliest dates are from gastropod shells and from inorganically formed
carbonates and relate only through typo-stratigraphic correlation to human activity. Between 20-
18,000 years BP, numerous charcoal dates prove human presence in the Nile Valley. Subsequently,
there are almost no reliable dates until the early Holocene wet interval in the Western Desert between
9500 and 5800 BP. After 5000 BP dates have become more numerous and lead into the Predynastic
and Old Kingdom periods. Climatic information is available for the Holocene from dates measured
om groundwater or wellwater, on carbonaceous deposits (tufa) and on organic layers found around and
im former playa lakes. There is general agreement between evidence of occupation in the area and
imceased rainfall with presence of dispersed water bodies.|14)

wessels have a considerably shorter use-life than storage/transport vessels and so are in greater demand.
The demand for cooking vessels by 100 households supports one specialist ollero producing unit; the

CRAFT SPECIALIZATION, REGIONAL EXCHANGE AND SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION IN
THE CENTRAL PANAMA FORMATIVE.

Prior to 1000 B.C. human occupation in Central Panama is represented by small mobile egalitarian
groups; by the Ist millennium B.C. some groups have begun to permanently settle at a few large sites,
with the largest being the 65 ha site of La Mula-Sarigua. Regional settlement data suggest a tremendous
reorganization of human groups rather than a significant population increase. Further, an extensive
examination of material assemblages, particularly lithic assemblages, from La Mula-Sarigua suggests
the initial appearance of craft specialization and regional exchange. This paper describes the evidence
tor these two features, their role in societal integration and their implications for the development of
a hierarchically-ordered power structure.(57)

SPATIAL STRUCTURE IN AUSTRALIAN HUNTER/GATHERER CAMPSITES.

Little attention has traditionally been devoted to the implications of spatial patterning of individual
structures in hunter/gatherer campsites, either archaeologically or ethnographically. Very little data
exist to indicate under what conditions hunter/gatherers camp close to each other or far away from
specific configurations such as linear or circular arrangements of structures. Data were collected from
a large Aboriginal campsite in the Australian Western Desert in order to help elucidate some of the
structuring principles involved in the spatial patterning of campsites.(44}

SPIRAL FRACTURES, FLAKED BONES, CUTMARK MIMICS, AND OTHER
CHARACTERISTICS OF NONCULTURAL ELEPHANT-BONE ACCUMULATIONS IN AFRICA.

Modern noncultural elephant-bone accumulations in Africa contain attributes identical to those
interpreted in fossil assemblages as end-effects of human activities. Such attributes include (1) limb-
bone fragmentation and flaking due to trauma, carnivore feeding, or trampling; (2) tusk fracturing in
life, creating fragments that can be mistaken for tools; (3) cutmark mimics caused by trampling; (4)

_ __ skeletal postures that might reflect agency or abruptness of death. The massive elephant-bone accu-
mulations under study are also unique sources of data about the extent of information loss which
. death processes create in bone samples.{15)

STORING FOOD AND STORING CORPSES IN PREHISTORIC TENNESSEE.

The burial of corpses in storage pits was a relatively common phenomenon in Southeastern prehis-
tory. Rejecting the traditional explanation of this practice as expedient behavior, this analysis explores
the possibility that actively manipulated symbolic links were drawn between the disparate processes
of inhumation and food storage. To this end, formal structural similarities between morturary treat-
ment and food storage techniques are noted at Terminal Archaic and Middle Woodland sites in Middle
Tennessee. Data from both ethnohistoric texts and general analyses on mortuary ideology are then
considered in an attempt to link the formal similarities to specific ideologies and social strategies.(60)

CATCHMENT WALLS: ENVIRONMENTAL ENHANCEMENT OF A VOLCANIC MESA
ESCARPMENT.

West of Albuquerque, New Mexico a line of small volcanic cones marks the western edge of the
Middle Rio Grande Valley rift. Volcanic flows from this rift have formed the impermeable caprock of
Albuquerque’s West Mesa. Surveys of the mesa top and escarpment have revealed large numbers of
low rock walls along drainages and above and below the escarpment. Many of the walls are only one
course high. Originally the walls were thought to mark prehistoric agricultural fields, but subsequent
evaluation suggests that they may have served to enhance water and soil retention for naturally-
occurring plants.|26)

EXPLORATIONS OF THE TWILIGHT ZONE: THE EARLY UPPER PALEOLITHIC OF
CANTABRIA AND GASCONY.

Models of Middle Paleolithic and late Upper Paleolithic (Solutrean and Magdalenian) hunter-
gatherer adaptations in Cantabrian Spain and adjacent SW France have been put forth recently by
Freeman, Butzer, Straus, and others. However, less has been done with the early Upper Paleolithic
|Aurignacian and Perigordian) in these regions, perhaps due to the relative scarcity of modern exca-
vations. While there were changes in human anatomy and tool technology at ca. 35,000 B.P., changes
in faunal exploitation and settlement pattern are less evident, suggesting that the full shift to “mod-
ern” patterns of adaptation was rather more gradual, perhaps taking as long as ca. 15,000 years. These
mvolved organizational changes.(4}

TRAVEL MOTIVES, ELITE ASPIRATIONS, AND THE COSMOLOGICAL CONTEXT OF
GEOGRAPHICAL DISTANCE.

Understanding the significance of interregional interaction requires understanding indigenous motives
and meanings involved in long-distance contacts. Ethnographic and ethnohistoric data are utilized 1)
to illustrate the cosmological significance accorded geographical distance in native perceptions of
space; 2) to review the diverse motives underlying long-distance travel, especially those relating to
acquisition of political-ideological esoteric knowledge; 3) to summarize the major contexts in which
political elites are involved in long-distance travel or with foreigners. It will be generally argued that
knowledge of and association with Jong-distance phenomena actively enhances the legitimacy accorded
leaders as exceptional persons with fuller understanding of the “inherent’’ powers and processes of
their society's cosmos.(8)

CHANGING ROCK ART, CHANGING SOCIETY? THE CASE OF THE STONE AGE FISHER-
HUNTER-GATHERERS OF ARCTIC NORWAY.

The analysis of the rock-carvings in Alta indicate that there are five contemporaneous changes
between the carvings and other spheres of culture among the area's fisher-hunter-gatherer population.
The changes in the carvings are particularly noted in the form of the figures and partly in what is
depicted. There are, in addition, some continuities in form as well as in the selection and frequencies
of the figures. The paper discusses to what degree the relationship between rock art and the general
archaeological record extends beyond chronology and reflects changes in society and beliefs.(38)

IDENTIFYING THE FUNCTION OF AN ABUNDANT, ENIGMATIC VESSEL TYPE FROM AN
TRANIAN CHALCOLITHIC FARMING VILLAGE.

More than a third of all sherds excavated in the Period VII levels at Seh Bagi (ca. 3100-2900 B.C.)
are from a distinctive pottery vessel type of uncertain function, perhaps used for bread-making or
grain processing. These often smoke-blackened vessels, made of chaff-tempered coarse ware, have
slightly concave bases and incurved walls. Below the rim, with its two opposed horizontal handles, a
row of small holes pierce the vessel wall. Distribution within excavated houses and trash deposits,
and vessel use-wear patterns provide evidence for vessel function. Similar vessels from other archae-
ological and ethnographic contexts are also discussed.(50)

tased on choice, arrangement, and rendering of motifs. Examination of morphological and technical
steributes indicate cach group probably represents the work of an individual potter/painter. Analysis
of the overlapping distributions of these groups among the excavated houses and graves delineates
ceramic marketing patterns within the settlement, valley and region.(50)

THE MAYA DOORYARD ORCHARD-GARDEN.

tn this paper the Maya dooryard orchard-garden is described from field work in northern Belize and

elsewhere in the Maya area. Recent archaeological evidence and the ethnohistoric record support the
, 80 Herscher, Ellen
argument that the dooryard orchard-garden has played an important role in Maya subsistence since
pre-Hispanic times. Maya dooryard orchard-gardens are intensively managed agro-ecosystems that
place heavy emphasis on the cultivation of semi-domesticated fruit trees. The gardens, in part, help
explain the dispersed pattern of pre-Hispanic Maya settlement and are here speculated to be the most
prominent component of the ancient Maya landscape away from the large ceremonial centers.(42)

THE ROLE OF MUSEUM ACQUISITION POLICIES.

Museums are widely recognized as an important link in the commercial chain of the antiquities
market, and the museum profession has formally acknowledged the relationship between that market
and the often destructive initial taking of an object. To play an active role in combating the illicit
trade, individual institutions and professional organizations have, over the past two decades, developed
ethical codes and policies governing acquisitions. Most comprehensive among these is the Code of
Ethics of the International Council of Museums (ICOM), adopted in November 1986. While it is
impossible to police adherence to such voluntary standards, evidence suggests widespread acceptance
by museums of public responsibility in this area.(2)

THE USE OF ATTRIBUTES OF DEBITAGE ASSEMBLAGES AS TEMPORAL INDICATORS.

In many areas a large portion of the archaeological record is composed of surface scatters of flaked
stone tools and debitage that are undatable by traditional methods. Lacking temporal control, these
sites are eliminated from consideration in model building and testing. This can lead to erroneous
regional and cultural interpretations because a considerable portion of the data base has been omitted.
This paper examines the potential for using debitage attributes as temporal indicators. The results of
a temporally oriented analysis of a large samples of debitage from 34 dated and undated contexts in
north-central New Mexico are then presented and evaluated.(56)

_ ___Changes in political systems and concomitant social changes may potentially affect a population's

health. Health patterns are examined with the development of a regional political system in the
. Valley of Oaxaca. Human skeletal remains (n= 232) from the Early Formative through the Postclassic

were examined for stress markers. The frequencies of the markers are compared among three groups:

before the development of the regional system (1400-500 B.C.}, as the system matured (500 B.C. - A.D.

650), and after its decline A.D. 650-1400). No significant differences in marker frequencies are observed

among the groups, suggesting that the development of a regional political system had no deleterious

health effects.|30)

EARLY UPPER PALEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT ON THE RUSSIAN PLAIN.

Upper Paleolithic industries were probably established on the Russian Plain by the end of the first
half of the Middle Pleniglacial {i.e., >40,000 B.P.). Sites occupied prior to the end of the Bryansk
Interstadial (ca, 25,000 B.P.) may be considered “early Upper Paleolithic.” Most sites are concentrated
in the Middle Dnestr Valley and along the Middle Don River, the vast Dnepr-Desna Basin appears to
have been largely uninhabited during this period. West and Central European culture-stratigraphic
classifications cannot be effectively applied on the Russian Plain, where artifact assemblages manifest
a robust native character and considerable diversity. Symbolic items (ornaments and decorated pieces}
have been recovered from many localities. There is some evidence of a Middle/Upper Paleolithic
transitional! industry in the Middle Dnestr Valley.(4)

PREHISTORIC ALEUTIAN DOGS.

Stratigraphic, associational, and absolute dating demonstrate that dogs were present in the eastern
Aleutian Islands in the prehistoric period. Prior to excavations at Chulka on Akun Island it was
generally believed that dogs did not exist in the prehistoric Aleutian culture. The discovery of
prehistoric dog remains at Chulka requires revision of this viewpoint. Analysis of the dog crania
suggest a closer affinity with Kodiak dogs than with other dog populations in Alaska which indicates
an interaction between Chulka and Kodiak that extended back at least 1000 years.(25)

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF POST-PALAEOLITHIC SITES FROM NORTHERN KHARGA OASIS,
EGYPT.

An archaeological survey and analysis of lithic artifacts from sites in Umm E]-Dabadib area, Kharga
reveal that the sites, called here “post-palacolithic,” date to the middle Holocene and are associated
with playa deposits of a moist phase. The majority of the assemblages belong to a single tradition to
which the later sites from Kharga Airport “Neolithic” sites are related. The assemblages show close
similarities to those from Dakhla, and some similarities with others from Baharia, Lobo, W. Bakht
end Dungul. Similarities with the Tarifian of the Nile Valley and between late Post-Palaeolithic
assemblages in Kharga and Predynastic sites indicate frequent Saharan-Nilotic cultural exchanges.(14)

READING VILLAGE PLANS.

The spatial layout of archaeological sites and structures carries information potentially valuable to
those trying to make sense of the past. Order in settlement plans takes forms such as common
exentation of structures, organization around focal space or structures, repeating house shapes or
Hocks, and enclosures and exclosures. The absence of order itself carries information. An ethnoar-
ehacological approach to contemporary Middle Eastern villages helps to expose the ways in which
leyouts are shaped by climate, terrain, social relations, tenure arrangements, and world view and to
@iscuss them in terms useful to archaeologists. (27)

UPLIFT OF THE PERUVIAN COAST BETWEEN 13.5 AND 16S LATITUDE.

Raised abrasion platforms between 13.5 and 16S latitude on the Peruvian coast represent the
geomorphic expression of paleo-sea levels. These features are firm evidence that this segment of the
, 82 Huelsbeck, David R.
Peruvian coast has risen during the late Pleistocene. A maximum possible uplift rate of 1.2 mm/yr is
found at 15.38 latitude near San Juan de Marcona. Other parts of this coastal segment have been rising
more slowly. Though different from other parts of the Peruvian coast some of the principal results of
this study, such as magnitudes of uplift rates and causes for tectonic uplift, can still be applied to
better understand the tectonic environment of other study areas. This purely geologic investigation
is concerned with events on a much longer time scale than most archaeologic studies, but provides
some criteria with which to evaluate to what extent uplift may affect the coastal geomorphology of
inhabited areas,(6)

HALIBUT LIVE WEIGHT AND PREHISTORIC FISHERIES ON THE OLYMPIC PENINSULA.

Accurate estimates of live weight are important components of many archaeological questions,

derived relating halibut vertebral width and life weight within narrow confidence limits. Application
of the equations to archaeological specimens demonstrates that the halibut captured prehistorically
off the Olympic Peninsula were smaller than historic averages, does not affect MNI estimates (in
these cases}, and suggests variation in fish size through time/space and/or variation in resource area
control,(25)

diversification. However, isolation is shown to be not simply geographic, but also results from dynamic
social and historical factors.(55)

“EXOTIC” CHERTS AND THE HOPEWELL INTERACTION SPHERE.

The Hopewell Interaction Sphere was a socio-cultural phenomenon based, in part, on the procure-
ment/exchange of non-local raw materials. One of these materials - chert - usually is cited as origi-
nating at one of several specific quarrying areas. However, the criteria for such source assignments
seldom are explicated and may be based on second-hand data, “looks like’ cognition, incomplete
knowledge of the raw material's variability, or archaeological folklore. The scope of this problem, and
its implications, are examined; models such as the HIS may be strengthened through explicative and
quantitative resolutions.(31)

ARCHAEOLOGY.

The deliberate observation of contemporary northern hunters is one way of enhancing the inter-

months of archaeological ethnography, followed by archaeological excavation at the same residential

relationships between observed behavior and its material expressions. Suggested guidelines for recog-
nizing tipis in the absence or architectural remains are discussed, as are considerations for discerning
activity patterns within this type of dwelling.(59)

to our understanding of the Keffer site’s location which is atypical for Huron sites, insofar as it is
practically indefensible.(50)

HUNTER-GATHERERS OF THE TERMINAL PLEISTOCENE IN UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA.

The archacological records of the Upper Palaeolithic phase in Uttar Pradesh suggest occupation of
three different geographical settings by the hunter-gatherers. Incidentally, evidence for the geo-
chronology and the habitation of the terminal pleistocene population is best preserved in this region.
On technotypological considerations the culture debris of the period seems to form two groups. The
earlier (c. 23,000-17,000 B.C.), was confined to the slopes of the adjoining hills where artefact faking
spots are located near the source of raw material. The later group (post c. 17,000 B.C.}, with presumably
greater population density, was occupying not only a wider area but also varying geographical settings,
such as the rockshelters, slope of the hills, banks of the rivers and the lakes.(20)

RECOVERY AND CLASSIFICATION AS A DETERMINANT OF INTERPRETATION.

The concepts of randomness, clustering, and association are examined in relation to pre- and post-
depositional factors of archaeological patterning. It is argued that randomness is an inappropriate
concept in an archaeological context, and merely reflects an inability to discriminate the patterning
present. In addition to the effect of different methods, it is argued that artifact recovery procedures
and a priori interpretation embodied in artifact classification can have a significant effect on the
results and interpretation of spatial analysis. These effects will be illustrated with examples from
Pincevent sector 36 and simulated distributions.(44})

BENTON POINTS, TURKEY TAILS AND CACHE BLADES: MIDDLE ARCHAIC EXCHANGE IN
THE SOUTHEAST.

One of the earliest and most extensive distribution systems in the Southeast centers on the
Tennessee River Valley during the Middle Archaic. The high quality tabular chert which is exposed
im the shoals and slopes of the Middle Tennessee in northern Alabama was transformed into a
distinctive stemmed biface, a preform type that appears to have been made for export and large,
extremely well made bifaces which were probably never intended to be utilitarian. This paper begins
at the extensive source area quarry sites, traces the distribution of artifacts and raw material south
isto the Coastal Plain, and discusses coincident evidence for complex ritual, Distributional networks
as large as this one do not occur again in this region until the terminal Archaic, 2000 years later.(40)

THEORY IN TEXT-AIDED ARCHAEOLOGY: A STRUCTURAL APPROACH.

{t is argued that research areas where material culture and written texts coincide provide an
opportunity to demonstrate the full potential of structural and symbolic approaches in archaeology.
Three reasons for this are discussed: the more direct access to the meaning of material symbols
provided by textual evidence; the additional gain in context thus provided; and the greater visibility
of active manipulation of material culture by interest groups within society. These propositions are
discussed in relation to the particular studies to be presented in the symposium, and the common
features of those studies stressed as an alternative approach to text-aided archaeology.(60)

SELECTIVE FLUVIAL TRANSPORT OF STONE AND BONE: AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH

FROM FLUME TO FIELD.

A recirculating laboratory flume was used to study the sorting and relative transport of archaeolog-
ical stone and modern bone materials, Fifty-one flume nuns were conducted. Bone and stone movement
was plotted as a function of rate of movement (cm/sec) with respect to individual mobility numbers.
Low transition and upper energy flow regimes show a clear separation in the rate of movement.
Settling velocity and drag coefficents are calculated for the material. These results have implication
for the understanding of distributions of artifactual material on some archaeological sites, and may
provide a key to interpreting the potential for movement on others [i.e., disturbance), The results are
applied to field problems.(15}

tool styles recovered in successive stratigraphic layers suggest that Kachemak evolved directly into
Koniag, contrary to earlier views.(7)

ANTHROPOMORPHIC FIGURINES AS IDEOLOGICAL PRACTICE: TEOTIHUACAN
FIGURINES AT MATACAPAN, VERACRUZ, MEXICO.

Teotihuacan’s dominance during the Middle Classic Period is in part evidenced by a wide distri-
bution of artifacts which stylistically link contemporaneous polities with the Central Mexican site.
A consideration of the ideological messages encoded in Teotihuacan artifacts found throughout
Mesoamerica elucidates the economic and political structure of Middle Classic, Teotihuacan-focused
society. A functional and stylistic comparison of the locally-produced Teotihuacanoid figurines recov-
eed from Matacapan with figurines from Teotihuacan reveals a set of codes concerning Matacapeno
social positioning vis-a-vis Teotihuacan. Figurines are analyzed as material representations of ideo-
logical practices which served to shape and reflect the structure of socio-political domination at the
site of Matacapan. These figurines are seen as an indigenous reinterpretation of a foreign ideology
rather than an imposition of that ideology through conquest, colonization, or economic domination.
Implications for the reconstruction of the political and economic nature of Teotihuacan-Gulf Coast

mteractions are discussed.(30)

LITHIC PRODUCTION AND USE: [IMPLICATIONS FOR SPATIAL ANALYSIS.

The use of space on a site cannot be simply ‘‘read off” from the distribution of functionally-identified
artifacts. The complicating factors include disposal as refuse and the retooling of hafted tools. Exam-
ples from the author's work on Meer, Verberie, and other sites illustrate these points. Methods by
which these complications are dealt with are discussed.(44)

THE THREE SIDES OF A BIFACE.

The effect of mobility on hunter-gatherer lithic technology is discussed in terms of three different
roles of bifacial tools: as by-products of the shaping process, as cores, and as long use-life tools. The
relationship between these tool roles and mobility, as well as their archaeological consequences are
discussed. Temporal trends in the use of bifacial tools in the Carson Sink and Stillwater Mountains
of west Nevada are briefly discussed to show how the proposed perspective on lithic technology can
elucidate temporal change in mobility strategies.(9)

INTRASETTLEMENT SPACE-UTILIZATION AND RESIDUAL SOIL PHOSPHATE LEVELS IN
THE UPPER BELIZE VALLEY, CENTRAL AMERICA.

Analysis of residual soil phosphates resulting from the deposition and decomposition of human and
animal wastes is an effective means of defining the extent and pattern of prehistoric settlements and
intersite land-use. This paper reports on a soil phosphate sampling program to define the limits of
several residential loci or houselots within two Classic period settlements in the upper Belize Valley:
Buenavista del Cayo, a small urban administrative center, and Guerra, a plazuela-focused residential
farming suburb. The sampling procedures and analytical techniques used are described and their
results are discussed.(43})

GROUND FIGURES AND ROADS IN ACARI, PERU.
Survey during the 1986 field season revealed the existence of hitherto unknown geometric ground
_ _ figures and pre-Inca roads in the lower Acari Valley of southern coastal Peru. The figures are probably
associated with Early Intermediate Period (Early Nasca) occupation in the area. Pre-Inca roads were
‘ associated with the Late Intermediate Period to judge from structural remains and sherd scatters
adjacent to the roads, and they were reused during Inca times, Interestingly, these roads lead to other
valleys of the coast, rather than upstream or downstream, suggesting the importance of inter-valley
communication. The association of traditional caravan trails with both roads and ground figures is
discussed.(49)

THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ANTICIPATED MOBILITY STRATEGIES AND SITE
STRUCTURE.

Ethnoarchaeological research provides a vehicle in which to test variables influencing Stone Age
archaeological site structure and the general organization of space, The frequency of monofunctional!
to multipurpose activity areas at a site is analyzed as a function of one or more of three potential
factors—mobility strategies (pomadic versus sedentary), economics (hunter-gatherers, farmers, or a
mixture of each), and/or ethnicity (modern Basarwa or ‘Bushmen”’ versus Bantu-speakers). Anticipated
mobility, rather than actual, is deemed most influential in determining site complexity in terms of
monofunctional loci. The implications of this study for spatial studies of Old to New Stone Age sites
are explored.(44)

turalist approach in the interpretation of a specific set of Thule artifactual remains and their possible
symbolic significance. Ethnographic accounts and archaeological data, additional to those used by
MoGhee, were examined to provide diachronic and synchronic depth to McGhee’s work. From this
study it appears that although a carefully constructed structuralist argument provides neat, appealing
explanations, these are not necessarily sufficient. By considering the materials contextually, non-
seructuralist arguments can provide equally plausible explanations.(60)

4 TECHNOLOGY IN ITS SOCIAL SETTING: HISTORIC IRON SMELTING IN CENTRAL
MALAWI, EAST AFRICA.

The technology and social organization of iron production in central Malawi (extinct since 1930)
4as been studied through interviews with former ironworkers, archival research, excavation of historic
smelting sites and extensive metallurgical investigation. A remarkable variety of furnace designs and
eperating procedures were recorded. The variety reflects the belief that failed smelting operauons
were caused by deliberate acts of sorcery by rivals. Fear of sorcery inhibited the exchange of information
between peers. Information was transmitted primarily from each master to his apprentices, giving
mse to a large number of parallel mini-traditions in the region. (32)

THE USE OF SPACE AROUND THE RESIDENCE BY THE ANCIENT FARMERS OF THE GULF
COAST: RECENT RESEARCH FROM THE SITE OF MATACAPAN, VERACRUZ, MEXICO.

The investigation of prehistoric agriculture has often focused on outfield production, relict agri-
cultural features, and paleobotanical remains. This paper examines the use of space and its material
eomsequences in residential contexts as an aid to understanding the livelihood patterns of tropical
cultivators in ancient Mesoamerica. The nature and form of activity areas within the tropical garden-
sesidence are examined and a model of the use of near residential space is presented. The model forms
the basis for the analysis of archaeological data from residential contexts at the site of Matacapan on

THE DETECTION OF PLANNING IN PALEOLITHIC ASSEMBLAGES.

The detection of planning in the archaeological record of Paleolithic hunter-gatherers is of concern
im certain unresolved problems. First, the evaluation of the cognitive abilities of early hominids and
sepiens is crucial to the understanding of the emergence of systematic hunting strategies and mobility
systems, which presume a viable ability to anticipate future needs and fit these goals with information
of the location, abundance, and periodicity of natural resources. Second, the degree to which early
hominids and sapiens could predict future foraging opportunities was probably acted on by selection,
Third, an important aspect of interassemblage variation is due to the relative importance of planned
wersus situational activities, The detection of planning in the Paleolithic record must be accomplished
by partitioning assemblage composition by the planning context of activities as well as, whether the
activity took place on-site or off-site, A framework for detecting planning in Paleolithic assemblages
ss outlined, Anticipated and situational activities are distinguished by patterned relationships between
precurement, manufacture, and use of tools employing raw material sourcing, reduction method,
refitting, and microwear analysis. Several Paleolithic cases are evaluated in this regard.{9)

LINKING ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA:
THE SENSITIVITY OF SPATIAL ANALYSIS METHODS TO POST-DEPOSITIONAL
DISTURBANCE.

K-means and unconstrained clustering analyses of artifact distributions from recently-abandoned
Bushman camps indicate patterning that is readily interpretable in the context of Yellen’s ethno-
graphic observations. However, because the camps were recorded shortly after abandonment, the
distributions analyzed were not subject to the disturbance and destruction that would be seen in
archacological deposits. To examine the sensitivity of our methods to post-depositional processes,
the same distributions were reanalyzed after simulated locational disturbance and artifact class-
specific decay. The results show that most behaviorally interpretable patterning can be detected by
these methods in spite of severe dislocation and decomposition.(44}

PLEISTOCENE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE DAKHLEH OASIS, EGYPT: BACKGROUND TO THE

Recent geoarchaeological research by I. Brooks and M. Kleindienst has established the presence of
human habitation at the Dakhleh Oasis and Paleo-oasis, dating from Upper Acheulian (? late Middle
Pleistocene) through Upper Pleistocene times. The distributions of stone artefact aggregates, and
industries, can be related to change in landforms and depositional contexts within the oasis. The
regional chronology based upon geomorphology and the analyses of large surface aggregates is com-
pared with evidence from elsewhere in the Western Desert.(14}

IRRIGATION AND CULTURE HISTORY IN THE EQUATORIAL ANDES.

Canal networks in dry Andean basins are often comparable in size and complexity to networks in
coastal Peruvian valleys. Existing maps of these canals are filled with inaccuracies. Recent research
has allowed mapping of canal networks in selected valleys of northern highland Ecuador. Many canals
still exhibit rustic construction features characteristic of pre-Hispanic technology. Colonial docu-
mentation and archaeological context provide clues for establishing canals’ age. The importance of
canal irrigation helps explain the political geography of late pre-Inca chiefdoms and the subsequent
history of ethnic displacement and replacement.(28)

RECONSTRUCTING PREHISTORIC DIET/SUBSISTENCE ON KODIAK ISLAND THROUGH
AN ANALYSIS OF STABLE ISOTOPE RATIOS IN BONE COLLAGEN.

Archaeological applications of stable isotope analysis derive from the fact that the isotope ratios
present in an animal's bone collagen reflect the isotopic ratios of its diet. This study compares the
ratios of stable nitrogen and carbon isotopes in the bone collagen of prehistoric populations on two
sites from the western side of Kodiak Island. The Our Point site in Uyak Bay, where the skeletal
sample comprises individuals from both the Kachemak and Koniag phase, and the Karluk-One site at
the terminus of the Karluk River: a Koniag site. Although these two sites are separated by a distance
of not more than twenty coastal miles, they present different resource profiles. The possibility exists
that differences in resource distribution were mitigated by seasonal movements, inter-regional feast-
ing, or trade, and this is discussed in terms of the stable isotope evidence.{7)

THE KONIAG: ETHNOGENESIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF A RANKED PACIFIC ESKIMO
SOCIETY.

‘ Archaeological work on Kodiak Island, Alaska since 1983 has yielded significant new data which
clarifies the formerly sketchy information available on prehistoric Koniag culture, and necessitates a
re-interpretation of views on Koniag cultural origins. Excavation of Karluk One, a wet site with
exceptional conditions of preservation, revealed a sequence of Koniag houses and more than 5,000
artifacts. The known range of Koniag material culture can now be seen to be primarily an in situ
development, rather than the result of influxes of immigrants from the Alaska Peninsula or Cook
Inlet.(7)

MORPHOLOGY OF A 17TH CENTURY HURON VILLAGE.

Twelve seasons of excavation have uncovered approximately three quarters of the 10 acre Ball Site,
an early 17th century Huron village near Orillia, Ontario. All or parts of 56 structures as well as large
portions of the surrounding palisade have been exposed. This work has revealed a rather systematic
arrangement of structures throughout the village suggesting some type of planned organizational
principles were used during village construction. It is suggested that the village was organized around
sociopolitical precepts that are physically represented by groups of houses surrounding open areas.
The recovery of 13 burials from the site indicates some of the demography of the population as well
as information about a little understood burial practice of the Huron.(36)

MANAGING HISTORIC PRESERVATION INFORMATION.

This paper explores the silent crisis in historic preservation — the management of information. In
the past, the Park Service encouraged preservation planners to make use of existing information before
seguiring new data. Unfortunately, gaining access to existing information is one of the most difficult
tasks in planning. Without a computer environment, planning bogs down to the tedious task of
meanually manipulating data, placing limits on analysis and shortening the range of planning options.
Two DBMS's, spatial and non-spatial, provide planners with a computer environment that turns the
“misis of information management into a powerful tool for expanding planning abilities.(54)

THE PRODUCTION OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY.

Contrary to a widespread opinion, neither geographic isolation, topographic recalcitrance, nor an
autonomous linguistic clock produced cultural diversity in the State of Oaxaca, Mexico. Evidence
from linguistics, archaeology, history, and ethnography contradicts these suggested explanations, and
points instead to several distinct social processes: 1) formation of initial ranked and territorial soci-
eties, 2) Balkanization of oft-contested corridors, and 3) marginalization in primate systems. These
processes are cross-culturally common, potentially generalizable, and significant for theories of diver-
sification.(5)

NORTHERN CENTRAL EUROPE AT CA. 18,000 B.P.

This paper documents the environmental changes in North Central Europe between 25,000 and
15,000 B.P. It then examines population shifts and cultural developments in specific regions. The
eastern zone shows more stable settlement with periodic oscillations of population shifts between
upper Dnestr and Volhynia. With the exception of several regions of favourable microclimates in
western Slovakia, important Gravettian centers disappear from the western zone after 22,000 - 21,000
B.P. The main part of the Gravettian population from the western zone shifts to the south, making
way for the origin of Epigravettian in the middle Danube and the Balkans and later to the east,
contributing to the origin of Kostenkian tradition on the Russian Plain. The divergence of ecological
conditions berween the western and eastern zones during the Second Pleniglacial can explain the
main differences in cultural evolution.(20)

HELP, NO HEARTHS: INTERPRETING PLIO- PLEISTOCENE INTRASITE SPATIAL PATTERNS.

Ethnoarchaeological observations of the camps of contemporary hunter-gatherers are demonstrating
that hearths are a social focus for nuclear families, a physical focus for the location of activities, and

’ “a magnet-like focus for small-size refuse discarded from a variety of activities, For upper paleolithic

sites in which hearths are found surrounded by concentrations of refuse, archaeologists frequently
‘ rely on the aforementioned observations as a means to interpret how prehistoric hominids structured

their use of space and organized their activities. Many of the Plio-Pleistocene archaeological sites

from East Africa, however, despite the absence of hearths, have distinct intrasite spatial patterns; this

paper will examine those patterns and the range of interpretive options in the absence of hearths or

direct evidence of other habitational structures,{44)

RESHARPENING, RE-USE AND SITE RE-OCCUPATION IN THE CENTRAL ITALIAN

The concept of curation, in the strategic sense, is central to the investigation of the changing
adaptive role of technology over the course of human evolution. Many of the analytical criteria
presently used to support inferences about curation within technological systems are ambiguous, and
do not allow the analyst to distinguish the effects of planned maintenance of tools from those of other
behavioral processes. This paper presents results from an ongoing study of assemblages from Mous-
terian strata in Central Italy, in which data from faunal assemblages are employed in concert with
several types of lithic morphotechnological evidence, in order to reduce analytical ambiguities.(9)

{n British archaeology, initial interest in the possibilities of reconstructing social behaviour from

PLANNING STONE TOOL MANUFACTURE AND USE IN THE GREEN RIVER BASIN: THE .
EFFECT OF DISCRETE RAW MATERIAL ATTRIBUTES ON ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS.

The planning of stone tool manufacture and use is likely to be conditioned by raw material
availability, and such raw material attributes as morphology and density, In Wyoming's Green River
Basin, quartzites and cherts are the two major raw materials, and they tend to occur as spatially
discrete secondary sources. Implications of differential tool planning are examined by comparing two
spatial data sets: small and large scale maps of the distributions and attributes of these two raw
material types, and smal! scale maps of stone tool and debitage distributions.(9)

affect the chipped stone manufacturing debris in the archaeological record, It is argued that debitage

AN HISTORICAL OVERVIEW OF ONTARIO PREHISTORY.

This paper surveys the past century of archaeological research in Ontario, focusing specifically on
issues which appear to be unique to Canadian archaeology or at least to differ from common practices

prehistoric archaeology in Canada, |B) the supportive work of the amateur community, and (C) the
importance of ethnographic analogy in prehistoric interpretation. This difference cannot be attributed
to British or other European influences to any great extent. Rather, it reflects the events which shaped
Ontario archaeological thought and, through the universities which disseminated this theoretical
orientation, shaped the whole of Canadian archaeology today.(33)

PREHISTORIC PROCUREMENT OF SECONDARY LITHIC SOURCES: THE CASE FOR
CHARACTERIZATION.

Geochemical identification of lithic sources is a new and exciting subfield of archaeology. Most
characterization studies have concentrated on quarry areas within primary rock outcrops. An impor-

This paper discusses the characterization of secondary chert sources by petrographic or thin-section
analysis and assesses the technique’s utility in identifying specific secondary formations as the raw
material source for prehistoric artifacts. Data from sites in the Delaware and lower Hudson drainages
of New Jersey and New York confirm the need for further analysis of non-quarry chert source

NATURAL FORCES AND HUMAN AGENCY—PARTITIONING VARIATION IN A LITHIC
INDUSTRY.

Lithic industries manufactured from naturally modified stone blur the boundary between natural
and cultural modification. Both nature and man shape stone into forms, but variation in form reflects
the application of distinct forces. Natural variation can be distinguished from cultural by a) predicting
changes in raw material due to natural forces, b} predicting changes produced by human agency, and
c) translating these predictions into measureable changes in lithic attributes. Analysis of a late
Pleistocene chopper-scraper industry from the Itaborai site, state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, illustrates
this method.(56}

COMPARABLE SAMPLING OF VARIED LANDFORMS IN THE REGIONAL SURVEY.

Regional archaeological surveys encompass areas characterized by diverse landforms and vegetation
associations: factors which influence site visibility. Yet, survey procedures are remarkably static, and
rarely take into account differences encountered in vegetation or terrain. As such, significant biases
exist on these surveys, as the chance of encountering sites varies from locale to locale, while survey
techniques are held constant across the region. These biases can be consequential, particularly as
regards their effects on reconstructing settlement patterns or prehistoric land use. Examples where
these biases may be seen are presented, and procedures are discussed which allow these biases to be
minimized.(34)

The first occupation within southern Belize appears to have occurred in the western part of the

region at the sites of Pusilha and Uxbenka. This model will attempt to explain the development of

JOPOPHILIA AND ROCK ART IN THE NORTHWEST PLAINS.

Ome variety of rock art found in the Northwest Plains of North America includes fine incised

pecrvelyphs that depict scenes of horses and their trappings with riders who carry guns and coup
, 94 Long, Austin, Wilson, Gore, Donahue, Jull and Linick
sticks. These scenes are similar to those on hides or those in ledger books that show the war deeds of
Plains Indian warriors. Another distinct variety of rock art contains therianthropic figures and other
shamanic images. The geographical settings of these two kinds of art are quite different. The incised
petroglyphs showing war deeds are often on large prominent cliff faces adjacent to major stream
valleys and travel routes or found associated with campsites. Shamanic art is often found in caves or
secluded locations with difficult access. This difference in the geographical settings of the types of
art lends credibility to our interpretation of its function. On a more refined level it appears that the
position of a site and its surroundings influence the content of the art.(38)

BONE DATING AT THE ARIZONA TANDEM ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETER |
FACILITY. |
The fundamental problem with '4C dating of bones is that the longer they have remained buried,
and the harsher the burial environment, the more degraded the collagen becomes, and the greater the
likelihood of more recent carbon contamination in the bone. Often it is the older, more difficult to
date specimens that are also the rarer and more interesting archaeologically. If no structural collagen
is recognizable in a bone, it may yet contain polypeptide fragments in sufficient abundance for AMS
\“C analysis. In order for the 'C dating result to be convincing, at least two size fractions must yield
concordant dates. Application of this approach to specimens of “known” age has yielded encouraging
results. We will also illustrate results of total amino acid AMS “C analysis of bone specimens, and
suggest standardizing of bone date reporting,{23}

POTTERY STANDARDIZATION: ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES FROM THE
PHILIPPINES.
Archaeologists assume that products of specialists will be standardized and that standardized pottery
reveals the presence of full-time potters. To test this, two populations of contemporary Philippine
cooking pots are studied: those made on a household basis by the Kalinga, a “tribal” society, and from
Paradijon, a neighborhood of full-time potters, The data indicate that pots from Paradijon are much
more standardized than those from Kalinga. Ports from the Grasshopper site (Arizona) also are examined
and the data suggest that their degree of standardization is most similar to the Kalinga sample,
strengthening the inference of prehistoric household production there.(50) :

COASTAL MAYA TRADE ROUTES IN SOUTHERN BELIZE.

, Four years of research on the coast and cays of the Stann Creek and Toledo Districts of Belize
provides evidence that changes in settlement patterns reflect significant differences in the nature,
routing, and termini of maritime trade in the Classic, Early Postclassic, and Late Postclassic. Local
and short distance canoe trade which hugged the coast and moved in relative security may have
predominated in the Classic. As long distance maritime trade developed in the Early Postclassic, it
still moved near the coast. Late Postclassic trade moved along the outer reef cays ta Nito and Naco.(47)

materials at six loci came from two superimposed strata. Further, bones of extinct horse at two loci
were associated with tools made on flakes from quartzite pebbles in the upper dark strata. The lower

INKA OCCUPATION OF THE COLCA VALLEY, PERU.
The Colca valley of southern Peru was known as an Inka breadbasket, yet preliminary invesngations
failed to identify a significant Inka occupation there. However, récent research on terrace and irrigation

, systems indicate a marked Inka presence, and nascent architectural studies suggest distinct Inka and
pre-Inka variations exist in both building design and settlement patterns as well. Ceramic studies
suggest that the initial confusion was due to the apparent melding of Inka and local ceramic traditions,
with few “pure” Inka wares present. Such a melding should be looked for in other areas of purported
minimal Inka influence.{41)

THE EARLY UPPER PALEOLITHIC OF THE LEVANT.

Unlike Western Europe, it is not necessarily simple to draw a line between the Middle and the

division is somewhat arbitrary. This paper will examine traditional views and more recent perceptions
of both the question of the technological and typological definition of the Upper Paleolithic, sensu
lato, and of the specific manifestations found in the Levant. Both data from the Lebanon and from
Israel will be considered, including questions of stone tool production, curation, and settlement

AN ETHNOGRAPHIC OVERVIEW OF HUNTER-GATHERER SUBSISTENCE.

Using refined measures of environmental productivity, this paper considers hunter-gatherer sub-
sistence as a function of food availability. Employing a cross-cultural sample of cases, the percent of
the diet derived from gathering is shown to be highly correlated with effective temperature, a measure
of the amount and intensity of solar radiation. Patterns in hunting and fishing dependence are then
explored. The study concludes by assessing changes in subsistence practices, including the shift to
agriculture, in light of this strong ethnographic patterning. (12)

GARBAGE AND GARDENS: THE DYNAMICS OF STONE TOOL DISCARD NEAR
RESIDENCES.
The process of agricultural intensification produces changes in the use of the landscape—where
things are done and how they are done. The agricultural labor force, orgamized at the level of the
: household domestic unit, is often restructured to meet these new labor demands. The utilization and
; ultimate discard of agricultural tools is a material consequence of these agricultural dynamics. Lithic
data from the agriculturally intensive (Pre-Hispanic) Maya settlement of Pulltrouser Swamp are
. examined in light of several propositions regarding the relationship between tool use, maintenance,
and discard and the location and intensity of agricultural activities.(42)

FROM FAMILY HEIRLOOM TO METATE PECKER: THE CONTEXT OF BIFACE RECYCLING
WITHIN AN ENTRENCHED EXCHANGE SYSTEM.

Stone tool use and recycling are conditioned by the means of raw material acquisition. In mobile
societies, groups may map onto resources and lithic procurement can be expected to be embedded in
the seasonal procurement of food resources. Tool recycling is likely to be situational and dependent
upon temporal and spatial removal! from zones of lithic availability.

Among sedentary agriculturalists recycling may be conditioned not by the environmental structure
of the resource habitat but by social and economic links between stone tool producers and consumers,
The institutionalization of exchange networks polarizes the lithic reduction sequence into (1) a
component of production with expedient use of debitage from early stage reduction, and (2) a com-
ponent of use with recycling of tool fragments.

Lithic data from an ancient Maya settlement zone in northern Belize are used to illustrate the
relationship between raw material acquisition and tool recycling.{9)

LOW ART IN HIGH CULTURE: A REANALYSIS OF THE TIKAL “GRAFFITI”.

The incised wall art at the important Maya site of Tikal, Guatemala, has been dismissed as
Postclassic graffiti", resulting from defacement/desecration associated with site abandonment. Although
these incisings do not display overt stylistic similarities to more formal Maya art, they comprise a
rich iconographic inventory, with a limited range of depicted motifs and themes. In addition, they
have recently been discovered in a number of sealed Classic contexts. Reconsideration of this corpus,
using formal iconographic and ethnography of communication-based analyses, suggests that it is the
result of ritual activities conducted in the building in which it is found and that it represents a
previously unrecognized record of Classic Maya nitual.(38}

noticeable effects on settlement decisions for humtes gatherers in highly seasonal environments. This
point is illustrated in a comparison of the annual rounds of historic Inuit groups in Arctic Canada

ADAPTATIONS IN DAKHLEH OASIS IN THE EARLY- TO MID-HOLOCENE,

Site location and artifact inventories suggest that three Late Prehistoric cultures identified in
Dakhleh represent quite different patterns of adaptation to the oasis and environs during a period of
climate change. The rare Epipalaeolithic sites are confined largely to the plateau above Dakhleh, and
their closest ties may be with the Nile Valley. The earlier of two Neolithic cultures represents nomadic
pastoralists who range widely through the desert, using the oasis only for periodic aggregations. Later
Neolithic sites may reflect more settled groups confined, in increasingly arid times, to the oasis
itself.(14)

Period to survive in the valley of Cuzco; (2) it represents a stylistic transition in architecture from
the Wari-imposed forms of the Middle Horizon to those of the Imperial Inca style of the Late Horizon;
(3) it can be identified with the legendary site of Muina, mentioned in the Spanish Chronicles, whose
overthrow was a crucial event in the forging of the early Inca State.{17)

DEFINING COASTAL MAYA TRADE STATIONS AND TRANSPORTATION ROUTES.

Various coastal Maya islands have produced evidence of exotic artifacts exceeding apparent needs
of local settlement. Striking examples are tiny river-mouth islands such as Moho Cay, northern Belize
and Wild Cane Cay, southern Belize. Classic and Postclassic deposits on habitable island areas of one
to four acres contain a remarkable abundance and/or diversity of exotics. Chemical sourcing and
analyses of obsidian density help identify these islands as trade stations and also suggest general
transportation routes. Comparison of obsidian sources and densities from other Maya sites provides
the basis for a coastal Maya trade model. (47)

WERE THERE EXCHANGE SYSTEMS AMONG NORTH AMERICAN PALEO-INDIANS?

The use of exotic lithic raw materials, a hallmark of Paleo-indian assemblages, is taken as evidence
of exchange systems among these groups, though such patterns may equally result from primary
procurement of stone at the source of secondary natural transport (as occurs in glacial and alluvial
systems} of stone from source to site. Demonstrating exchange requires consideration of Paleo-indian
subsistence and settlement strategies, territoriality, and the manner in which exotic material is
packaged” and used in assemblages. While it is difficult to prove, it seems likely that exchange
played at best a minor role in the movement of lithic material among Paleo-indians. This lessens but
does not exclude the possibility of exchange of other, perhaps perishable, commodities.(40)

THE EFFECTS OF TRAMPLING ON SUBSURFACE ASSEMBLAGES: AN ALYAWARA CASE
STUDY.

Recent research has shown that trampling by site occupants may have a significant effect on the
spatial distribution and content of subsurface assemblages. Surface deposited objects may be differ-
entially buried to depths of several tens of centimeters according to object size or weight. Data from
a recently occupied and abandoned Alyawara settlement in Central Australia provides a basis to
examine the effects of trampling. Sizes and weights of objects in the subsurface assemblage produced
by trampling as well as in the surface assemblage were analyzed and compared to determine the best
predictor of subsurface assemblage content. Surprisingly, object width accounts for frequency of
downward migration better than either length or weight, The practical archaeological implications
of these results are assessed.(15)

artifactual styles, and in the presence of actual objects apparently imported from Central Mexico, has
long been known at Tikal. Another class of evidence has now been recognized: A group of 8 interments
that closely resemble some Classic period burials from Teotihuacan. Characteristics of the Tikal
burials and their temporal and spatial distribution suggest the existence of an enclave of Teotihuacanos
on the SW peripheries of Central Tikal during the Period that the Manik 3A ceramic complex was in
use. Some of the social and political implications of a physical presence of Teotihuacanos at Early
Classic Tikal will also be explored.(11)

GRUBGRABEN, A GRAVETTIAN SETTLEMENT IN LOWER AUSTRIA.

The primary objective of the Grubgraben research project was to investigate changes undergone by
late Gravettian settlements under the pressure of increasingly cold and dry climatic conditions at the
onset of the last Pleniglacial.

Grubgraben is a large, multicomponent, open-air site in Lower Austria; 4 occupation layers are
stratified in a series of loess deposits. The uppermost level is an intraloess occupation. Evidence
suggests a briefly occupied campsite. The main layer marked by the presence of stone structures,
abundant faunal remains and highly reduced tools at the junction of 2 loess deposits. The archaeolog-
ical sequence is tentatively correlated with layers 5-9 ar Willendorf.{16)

THE CHIMU EMPIRE AND RAISED FIELD AGRICULTURE IN THE CASMA VALLEY, PERU.

The Chimu Empire (AD 900-1470), located on the North Coast of Peru, expanded into the Casma
Valley early in the 14th century. The Casma Valley was integrated into the Chimu Empire in diverse
ways. One example of this was the construction of a complex of raised agricultural fields, the only
raised fields reported for the Peruvian coast. The fields were constructed by workers who lived in an
adjacent planned settlement that was partially maintained by the Chimu state. Data from 1986
excavations in the fields and the settlement are presented, and the significance of these data for
understanding prehistoric imperialism is discussed.|17)

QUANTITATIVE RECONSTRUCTION OF PREHISTORIC DIET IN PERU.

Analysis of archaeological remains from the cold, high altitude grasslands of Junin, Peru, allowed
estimates of the make up and quality of the preceramic diet. Faunal remains suggest that hunting and
herding dominated economic activity in this area, which is above the limits of agriculture. Bone
composition data provide quantitative estimates of the human diet: humans, herbivores, and carni-
vores have been analyzed for trace elements in bone, and for stable isotopes of N) and CO, in bone
collagen. The '*N values for humans (x = +10.2) show a clear separation from the herbivores,
suggesting carnivory.(49)

MARITIME AND INLAND ARCHAIC ADAPTATIONS IN MID-EASTERN QUEBEC.

Recent archaeological work in the head and mouth areas of the Saguenay river shows that Archaic
occupations exhibit much more variation than is usually thought in a subarctic environment. In the
head area numerous sites are akin to the southwestern Laurentian Archaic tradition. Northern as
well as Western influences and/or intrusions are also noticeable. However, these outside influences
are counterbalanced by continuous long term occupation since the first millennium BC. In the mouth
area, a 5,000 BP occupation is characterized by a very intensive seal exploitation, associated with a
lithic assemblage of essentially Laurentian Archaic style. This whole pattern of Archaic heterogeneity
in such a relatively small region may be accounted for by peculiarities of the ecological setting since
this whole area is not of the boreal forest type but of mixed forest type and by the very numerous
waterways, Saint-John lake playing the role of a center place into which rivers flow from the North
(James Bay) and the West (Saint-Maurice area) and drain toward the Saint-Lawrence.|22)

GEOARCHAEOLOGY ON THE SOUTH COAST OF PERU.

Recent research on the south coast of Peru focuses on the effects of tectonically induced coastal
uplift on local subsistence practices. Two problem areas are defined: (1) the changes in diet and
foodways of an early preceramic, maritime culture resulting from a fluctuating littoral zone and; (2)
the effects of changing hydrological patterns on irrigation agriculture systems. Examining changes in
the relative accumulation of shellfish species in a midden deposit through time allows the tracking
of a changing littoral zone caused by coastal uplift. Changes in the hydrological regime which affect
irrigation agriculture lead to specialized farming techniques which are better evaluated following an
understanding of the selective pressures which cause their adoption.(6)

INFORMATION FLOW IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA MANAGEMENT.

Since the introduction of microcomputers, data base management has become a widely used
technique in archaeology. System design and the sequence of information flow are critical components
in the archaeological data management process. An effective system must: 1) structure data collection
in the field and laboratory to fit research designs well in advance of excavation, 2) expand the analytical
process, and 3) reduce recording efforts. ARDVARC, a dedicated archaeological data manager is used
as an example of a system which effectively structures, evaluates and curates archaeological infor-
mation for site locational surveys, remote sensing surveys, site examinations and archaeological
excavations.(39)}

LANDS UNSUITABLE FOR MINING, AN UNSUITABLE PRESERVATION TOOL.

In the eastern coal states, where regulatory options that serve to protect significant archaeological
sites are severely limited, the lands unsuitable for mining (LUM) petition process would appear to
provide at least one tool for preservation. Two LUM petitions, filed in Indiana and in Kentucky,
provide contrasting examples for examining this process as a viable preservation mechanism. The
LUM process is shown to generate legal muddles and antagonism. As such, the process is considered
an abysmal preservation tool.{18)

DIET, STATUS AND THE EMERGENCE OF COMPLEX SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN IRON AGE
CENTRAL EUROPE: SOME CONTRIBUTIONS OF BONE CHEMISTRY.

Techniques of bone chemistry analysis are used to test recent models of Iron Age social organization
based on traditional archaeological, historical and ethnographical observations. Human remains from
twenty burials at Magdalenska Gora, Slovenia, are selected for isotopic analysis. These burials rep-
resent different depositional phases and varied burial wealth. A complement of early Iron Age floral
and faunal remains is analysed to supplement the chemical dietary evidence. When compared to the
archaeological evidence for status, these isotopic data offer a fresh perspective on the social organi-
zation of an early Iron Age community, and show considerable promise for the study of the evolution
of complex European society.(48)

INUIT AND PALEO-ESKIMO RAW MATERIALS PROCUREMENT AND EXCHANGE IN THE

EASTERN CANADIAN ARCTIC: SYSTEM STRUCTURE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR STUDIES

OF OTHER EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES.

The Paleo-Eskimo and later neo-Eskimo (Inuit) inhabitants of the Eastern Arctic required a wide
variety of organic and inorganic materials on which their technologies and ideologies were based.
Although many were procured directly, as a consequence of seasonal movements and activities, others
were obtained from great distances by exchange. Focusing on the geographic distributions of sources
for various kinds of materials, and exploring the relationships between procurement of different
materials, it has been possible to reconstruct the structure and details of their procurement and
exchange systems, These data have important implications for similar investigations of other egali-
tarian, hunting/gathering societies.(40)

HOUSEHOLD ARCHAEOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS AS PROCEDURES FOR
STUDYING FORT ANCIENT COMMUNITIES IN THE OHIO VALLEY.

The smallest unit of the archaeological community is the social arrangement known as the house-
hold and its archaeological correlate called the household unit. The household serves as a synthesizing
unit in that it binds together a variety of classes of data such as artifacts, dwellings, features, burials,
and activity areas. Once identified, households afford the opportunity to study variation within both
material and social organization aspects of communities. The role of functional or use-wear analysis
in the study of households in general, and Fort Ancient in particular is discussed. Problems of artifact
sample site, selection of use-wear data, and methods of household identification will also be reviewed.(56)

QUATERNARY GEOLOGY AND PALEOECOLOGY OF THE KARLUK AREA, KODIAK ISLAND,
ALASKA.

Surficial geology of the Karluk area is complex and includes deposits left by at least two incursions
of glacial ice from Shelikof Strait, Uppermore deposits in the area around Karluk consist mainly of
outwash derived from inland glaciation on Kodiak Island itself. Postglacial downcutting by the Karluk
river has left numerous fragmental terrace surfaces; known archaeological sites are typically located
on the lower terraces, but deposits of volcanic ash may mask minor sites on upper slopes. Local
tectonic activity has probably played a role in the past in determining coastal settlement patterns.
Shrub alders invaded the landscape immediately following deglaciation, regional vegetation has
changed little in postglacial time.{7)

JASPER EXTRACTION AND THERMAL MODIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND THEIR
BEHAVIORAL IMPLICATIONS, IN SOUTHWESTERN NEW ENGLAND.

A new lithic source area has been identified in the Berkshires of northwestern Connecticut and
western Massachusetts where jasper and jasperoid are found in the quartzite conglomerate of the
Dalton Formation. At the Carlson } site, NW Connecticut, there is evidence that jasper was extracted
from the matrix by a combination of percussion and thermal fracturing, and then possibly modified
by additional heat treatment. One feature consists of L5m? of fire-reddened soil, charcoal, production
debris, hammerstones, and other artifacts. The behavioral implications of this apparently labor-
intensive technology are discussed, as are source area locations and site distribution patterns.(31}

ECONOMIC SPECIALIZATION AND EXCHANGE IN OAXACA: THE PRODUCTION AND
TRANSPORT OF SHELL, CLOTH, AND OBSIDIAN IN THE EJUTLA REGION.

Despite its demographic and political marginality, the Ejutla Valley was surprisingly important as
an economic gateway involved in the production and exchange of certain exotic goods. Shell, obsidian,
and spindle whorls were relatively more abundant in the Ejutla region than in the Valley of Oaxaca
proper, and their spatial distributions may indicate one route by which these products entered Central
Oaxaca, For Ejutla, the advent of these economic activities seems to be tied to the development of a
more integrated regional system in the Central Valley of Oaxaca.(5)

inability-to identify specific causal factors which trigger the evolution of tribal organization. Analysis
of archaeological data from west-central New York reveals thar changes in settlement patterning

« associated with the evolution of Seneca Iroquois tribal society are preceded by the movement of an
Ontario Iroquois population into this region. This data further suggests that Seneca tribalization may
be viewed as the development of an effective adaptive response to a situation of increasing risk due
to environmental uncertainty (see Braun & Plog 1982) associated with demographic changes which
follow this event.(36)

THE PROVINCES IN THE HEARTLAND: STYLISTIC VARIATION AND ARCHITECTURAL
INNOVATION NEAR INCA CUZCO.

The architectural style that spread with the Inca Empire is one that shows, on the face of it,
remarkable uniformity. A closer analysis reveals a style that is admirably suited to the realization of
Inca imperial goals, and to expressing the hierarchical relations that prevail in the Inca social order.
The sites that show the greatest range of stylistic variation are the estates built by particular Inca
lords. Study of the standing architectural remains on the royal estates near Cuzco helps us to under-
stand the Incas’ perception of their relationship to subject populations, and suggests that the estates
modeled the social order expressed in the organization of the provinces.(41)

The island of Antigua has more aceramic sites than any other island in the Lesser Antilles. A survey

sites conform to models of site location which predict access to shallow marine estuary resources;
however, at least three sites are anomalous in that they are located more than 500M from the present
sea shore, at elevations in excess of 90M. The differences between these anomalous sites and the
more common sites are presented, followed by alternative hypotheses, to be tested by excavations,

distribution of activities at residential base camps, are reported for the first time. After a description
of structures and facilities at a sample of seven Hadza camps the character and distribution of activities
within those camps are described, drawing on the results of systematic quantitative behavioral
observation. Archaeological implications of these data are specified, with special attention to patterns
of association anticipated among various types of refuse, and the scales of which these should be

apparent.(44)

DEMOGRAPHIC AND ECONOMIC CHANGES IN THE HALLSTATT PERIOD OF THE
LUSATIAN CULTURE.
In the declining phase of the Hallstatt Period, the 7th and 6th centuries B.C., the Lusatian Culture
in the region of the Oder and Vistula River basins in what is today northwest Poland underwent a
socio-economic developmental leap, as evidenced by the appearance of large fortified settlements for
the first time. This transformation can be explained by a deterioration of the climate and concomitant |
demographic pressure which caused an increase in the demand for limited provisions. This demand
in turn caused the intensification of non-farming occupations, such as cattle-breeding, which led to
an ecological imbalance, which necessitated concentration of the population in nucleated settle-
ments.(48)

CULTURE AND EXCHANGE IN MESOAMERICA AND THE SOUTHWEST. .
Many archaeologists persist in using cultural and ethnic units as starting points in the analysis of ;
exchange systems. In Mesoamerican studies, “ethnic” boundaries are often seen as obstacles to
exchanges between elites and specialists, while Southwesternists similarly “reity” exchanges between
the Southwestern and Mesoamerican culture areas, We argue that social systems should form the
basis of exchange models, and that cultural differences may actually promote exchange. Artificial
distinctions between “preciosities” and “essentials” and between “market” and “redistributive”
economies result from a failure to view exchange as a social process involving specific groups of
individuals rather than cultural entities.(8)

There are several indices for the presence of Teotihuacan in Guerrero (ceramics, sculpture, archi-

made by artists from Guerrero; the origin of Granular Ware, widely distributed in the Basin of Mexico,

EXCHANGEABLE IONS IN BONE AND SOIL AS INDICATORS OF POSTMORTEM
DIAGENESIS.

The chemical composition of human and faunal bone excavated from archaeological sites can
provide the anthropologists with a wide range of information including relative and chronometric
dates, paleodiet, and paleohydrology/paleoclimate. However, meaningful inferences from bone chem-
istry are dependent upon a control for postmortem diagenetic alterations in the burial environment.
X-ray diffraction and infrared absorption analyses indicate that dissolution and recrystallization do
not occur until thousands of years after burial. However, ionic exchanges between the soil solution
and calcium phosphate crystal surfaces may still occur. Exchangeable ions in bone and soil are
examined to address these postmortem exchanges.(1)

TO HEAT OR NOT TO HEAT, THAT IS THE QUESTION!

A major problem encountered in attempts to understand the use of heat in lithic technologies is
the difficulty of distinguishing berween intentionally and accidentally heated materials. A method
for doing this is proposed and applied to eastern Paleo-Indian site assemblages. The method reveals
examples of partial heating which appear to have been an important, heretofore unrecognized variant
of the process. The presence of partial heating may improve our understanding of the skills possessed
by the ancient technologist, and will go a long way towards setting straight the confusion that
surrounds the concept of heating stone in the ethnographic literature.(46)

to examine the evolutionary relationships between cultural heterogeneity and population size. The
results and methodological considerations of this type of cross-cultural archaeological study are

the concept of the elite prestige social system, this paper will focus on the Tarascan elite social system
as a source of interaction with other cultural traditions and a contributing variable in the development

of Tarascan civilization. Data drawn from archaeology, ethnohistory and linguistics will consider
elite ideology, population movements, and the structure of prestige and power.(30)

CONNECTIONS AND INTERFACES BETWEEN PRODUCTION-DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS IN
HIGHLAND MEXICO AND ON THE GULF COAST.

Exchange is one of the principal mechanisms by which goods are distributed in complex societies.
Such distribution systems may be local or involve the movement of goods across system boundaries.
In Highland Mexico and on the Gulf Coast certain production-distribution systems were large-scale,
internally differentiated, and spatially segregated; others were much smaller in scale, relatively
undifferentiated, and oriented primarily to local clienteles, Exchange also involved the movement of
“information” across the landscape, as reflected by the presence of horizon styles. In this paper data
on ceramics and obsidian working are used to illustrate these fundamental differences in system
structure, articulation, and function. The effects of transportation mode on system structure and scale
are also discussed,(40)

A FORMULA FOR ESTIMATING MINIMUM NUMBER OF LITHIC TOOLS.

In order to account for both complete and fragmentary tools in a lithic assemblage and so gain a
more accurate idea of relative proportions of different tool types, a simple formula for estimating the
minimum number of individual tools represented in each tool class has been devised, The formula
was developed while working on a large assemblage of unifacial flake and blade obsidian tools and is
being tested on other kinds of assemblages. The formula is explained, applications of the formula are
shown and its limitations discussed.(56)

THE CONSUMPTION OF IDEAS AND THE PRODUCTION OF BEHAVIOR: PAST AND
PRESENT IN ANNAPOLIS, MARYLAND.

While most of the papers in this session are about the production and consumption of material
goods, this paper takes a slightly different focus: the consumption of ideas and the production of
behavior, in both the past and the present in Annapolis, Maryland. This entails three main issues.
The first is the recursive nature of material culture as a theme in the analysis of archaeological
materials in Annapolis. The second is the presentation of this idea, and the results it produces, to
residents of and visitors to Annapolis, in the context of archaeological site tours or museum exhibits.
The third issue is the presentation to the public of the idea that versions of the past, just like material
goods, are produced, consumed, and used. And just as material culture teaches and shapes behavior,
s0 too do various versions of the past call for particular responses and behaviors from those who
accept them.(29)

LITHIC PROCUREMENT AND HUNTER-GATHERER ORGANIZATION IN THE CENTRAL BIG
HORN BASIN, WYOMING,

In the central Big Horn Basin of northwestern Wyoming, archaeological materials are scattered
almost continuously along Pleistocene terraces containing large quantities of quartzite, chert and
basalt cobbles. This research demonstrates the existence of complex patterning through the applica-
tion of factor analysis to data generated from a “‘nonsite”’ survey in this region. Pattern recognition is
facilitated with an experimental study of debitage variability from different core reduction and tool
production strategies. Conclusions are drawn regarding lithic resource utilization strategies and
regional settlement and subsistence systems.(56)

THE PAJARITO FIELD HOUSE PROJECT: PRELIMINARY RESULTS.

The Pajarito Field house Project was conceived as a problem-oriented research program focusing on
the adaptive significance of the ‘‘field house strategy.” The theoretical orientation of the project is
provided by the concentric zone model drawn from economic geography which predicts that field
houses should be located only near those fields which are relatively distant from a large pueblo. In
order to test this model, the Pine Springs study area was surveyed and several field houses were
excavated. The results generally support the model although other kinds of small structural sites are
located near pueblos.(26)

GIFT BASKETS AND SALE BASKETS: DYNAMICS OF POMO POWER RELATIONS.

This paper will reanalyze ethnographic and ethnohistoric data to show the role of baskets as a
material medium in the negotiation of power relations between men and women, elders and youths,
and between families in the hunter-gatherer Indians of Northern California (Pomo). It will show that
inequality was masked by a strong ideology of equality, which obscured the true power relations. The
dynamics of these relations are explored by showing the effect of women basket makers entering the
market economy of white society.(58)

MATERIAL CULTURE AND THE STUDY OF CONSUMPTION IN NINETEENTH CENTURY
~ PARADISE VALLEY, NEVADA.
In historical archaeology, material culture is both the meaning-bearing context of human behavior,
4 and the expressive product, or “artifact’’ of the behavior. The archaeology of 19th-century Paradise
Valley, Nevada demonstrates the critical role material culture played in how the relationships of
production of goods, national marketing and distribution systems, and the reorganization of social
groups were established and then manipulated at a local scale. At a more national or cultural level,
the study illustrates how material culture served as a vehicle for interpreting, manipulating, and
integrating the broad social changes of the time into the social structure of a given community.(29)

THE INVISIBLE UNIVERSE: NON-PLATFORM FEATURES IN THE MAYA LOWLANDS.

Non-platform features have been recorded from many sites in the Maya Lowlands, but their function
has seldom been determined. Testing of several such features at the site of Nohmul in northern Belize
supports their interpretation as full-time habitations and suggests that a surprising density of invisible
domestic features may exist at Nohmul. The implications of these findings for previous estimates of
lowland Maya population densities and for future settlement pattern research are reviewed.(24}

THE NEXADI PHRATRY OF THE SANYAKWAN TLILNGIT.
The Sanyakwan are unique among the Tlingit because they have three exogomous phratries and
the remaining kwans have only two. The anomolous phratry is the Nexadi. Previous researchers
speculated that the Nexadi splintered from the Tsetsaut Athapaskans and became Tlingitized, but
Tlingit origin myths disclose the Nexadi as being recognized as Tlingit since migrating to the coast
from the Unuk River Drainage. The Nexadi, like all of the Sanyakwan, had intermarried and traded
with their Tsetsaut Athapaskan neighbors. This synthesis will shed light upon the cultural dynamics |
of the region including strong economic ties to the boreal forest environment.(59}

DIFFUSION OF DISEASE AT EUROPEAN CONTACT. |
A major focus of contact period studies concerns whether or not epidemic diseases decimated native
populations during the sixteenth century. While some outbreaks are described in local histories, the
question of whether and how far pathogens spread beyond the points of origin is debated. In this
paper, the question of sixteenth century disease diffusion in the Southeast is approached from several
perspectives: Known or suspected microbial imports are considered epidemiologically to determine
their diffusion potential. The archaeological record is evaluated to determine possible diffusion
pathways, and whether the record demonstrates the kind of demographic change warranted by disease
contact. Experimental evidence derived from geographic diffusion models suggests how suspected |
pathogens might have spread.(40)

FROM HUNTING-GATHERING TO VILLAGE AGRICULTURE IN THE HUMID TROPICS: A
4000 YEAR LONG PROCESS IN CENTRAL PANAMA,
A recently completed regional study in Panama has documented an 8500 year long sequence of
continuous occupation. In this paper, the 4000 year period from the initial appearance of domesticated
plants at ca 7000 B.P. to the eventual emergence of intensive agriculture is examined using evidence
from (1) settlement patterns, (2) paleoecological and paleogeographic reconstructions, |3) botanical
remains, (4) human skeletal remains, (5} faunal remains and (6) lithic and ceramic assemblages. We
argue that these data document a largely in situ development albeit with extraregional influences at
three critical junctures.(57)

PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS IN ARCHAEOLOGY.
Phytoliths are microscopic mineral deposits that form in and between plant cells; specialized grass
silica cells accumulate abundant and distinctive phytoliths. Our primary classification, based on
modern grass phytoliths, has eight shape types: dumbell, cross, saddle, rondel, sinuous, rectangle,
triangle, and pentagon. Grass subfamilies are characterized by assemblages of these types; further
research will refine identification to tribes or possibly genera.
Phytoliths are preserved in sediments from the present to the Paleocene. Phytolith analysis at Big
Hidatsa, a late prehistoric-early historic Plains Village, indicates that differential use and discard of
plants is important. Specific sediment provenience can yield fine-tuned microstratigraphic informa-
tion.(53)

CIRCULAR STRUCTURES ON THE GULF COAST AND AT TEOTIHUACAN.

The presence of foreign portable objects (Gulf Coast and Maya ceramics, shell, jade, chert) at
Teotihuacan has been well documented. Recent excavations at the “Merchants”’ Barrio, Teotihuacan,
reveal that a distinctive style of architecture, round structures with ramps, was probably introduced
by a group of foreigners in the Early Classic Period. The structures bear close resemblance to those
reported on the Gulf Coast. The significance of these finds and their spatial and temporal distribution
will be discussed.(11)

LIMITED ACTIVITY SITES AND LOW VISIBILITY REMAINS: IMPLICATIONS FOR
INTERPRETING SOUTHWESTERN PREHISTORY.

The prehistory of various regions of the American Southwest has been wntten as though long term
developmental sequences, encompassing hundreds of years of developmental continuity within a
single cultural tradition, were the rule rather than the exception. Recent research in several geographic
areas indicates that such continuity is rare, that discontinuous and episodic patterns of cultural

development were more frequent. This paper examines issues related to models of developmental
continuity/discontinuity by focusing on the way low visibility archaeological remains, and especially
limited activity sites, have been incorporated in regional culture histories.(24)

CONTACT SHOCK AND THE ROUTES OF CONTAGION DURING THE EARLY HISTORIC
PERIOD IN THE GREATER SOUTHWEST.

Epidemics involving Old World diseases frequently spread northward from Mesoamerica into
northwest Mexico and the southwest United States during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.
As a consequence of repeated exposure to smallpox and other maladies, native populations were
reduced by as much as 90% prior to ca. 1675. The rate and.magnitude of population decline was
not, however, uniform and was dependent in part on a group’s involvement in native and Spanish
trade networks. This point is illustrated through an examination of Spanish and native exchange
networks and a comparison of population trends among groups such as the Opata and
Tarahumara.(40)

LOOKING AT THE PAST USING ADVANCED GRAPHICS SYTEMS.

The application of powerful three-dimensional colour graphics sytems used in conjunction with
flexible data-management systems make it possible for archaeologists to record and analyse very large
volumes of spatial and contextual information in new and exciting ways. Such systems are being used
in Britain to assist in the investigation of both excavation and survey data. They are particularly
interesting in that they allow archaeologists to reconstruct their primary data (to the level of detail
it was recorded at), thus facilitating re-examinations of the material formations revealed. The material
can be “viewed” from perspectives which would be impossible in any other way. This often stimulates
the formulation of new types of questions which can be asked of the computer model. The potential

EVOLUTION OF SUNFLOWER, SUMPWEED, AND THE EASTERN AGRICULTURAL
COMPLEX.

Sunflower and sumpweed have long been considered prehistoric domesticates of eastern North :
America based on increases in the size of their seeds. The pattern of morphological evolution of this |
trait in both plants allows insight into the nature of their coevolution with humans from Archaic 7
through late prehistoric periods. The plants differ slightly in seed size evolution as a result of basic |
biology, but seed size trajectories are alike in general form and indicate consistent selection for i
symbiotic relationships between the plants and human agriculturalists through the late prehistoric i
period, despite competition with maize, other small seeds, and each other.(22)

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH ON THE SOUTH COAST OF PERU.

Portions of the south coast of Peru have experienced limited attention by professional archaeologists.

CIPS is a not-for-profit corporation designed to direct, support and otherwise expedite studies in
archaeology and related disciplines centering in the Acari and Yauca valleys, and the Atiquipa and
Chala regions of the south central coast of Peru. The area is rich in archaeological remains from lower
Early Horizon through the Colonial period. Of priority is the salvage of textiles and ceramics from
vandalized cemeteries. Site survey, mapping and test excavations greatly facilitate the understanding
of the temporal and cultural relationships and local expression of style in relationship to neighboring,
better-known regions of Peru.(49)

PREHISTORY OF THE PERIGORD AROUND THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM.

While the southwestern part of modern France provides this paper's focus, data from other parts of
south France will also be discussed. The region has yielded a long series of C14 dates that can be
integrated with geological, palynological and paleontological observations to provide a detailed chro-
nology at the 18,000 B.P. time spike. Lithic assemblages are variable in terms of typology, technology,
and material utilization: this variability can be explained in both functional and cultural terms.
Integration of lithic and faunal data suggests that major changes in human adaptations occurred at or
near the 18,000 B.P. time period.{20)

REFLECTIONS IN A LAGOON: MARSHALLESE ATOLLS AS MIRRORS OF HIGH ISLANDS.

Ethnographic data from the Marshall Islands suggest that a well developed chiefdom existed there
despite limiting factors of small populations, limited landmass and high potential for natural disaster.

The chiefdom, based on a matrilineal clan system, is partially correlated with the dispersal of clan
membership north-south, but it is based on principles of land tenure similar to those of high islands
where clan resource use maximizes environmental diversity over the landscape. This is shown in the
division of taro pits at Laura village on Majuro where strips of clan controlled land meet. Excavations
at the borders of these taro pits suggest that they date to the initial settlement period at Laura village
ca. A.D.-B.C. Exploitation of this environmental diversity was an important aspect of initial coloni-
zation of this part of Majuro atoll, and perhaps of the Marshalls as a whole.(55)

VILLAGE SPATIAL ORGANIZATION IN THE SOUTH AMERINDIAN LOWLANDS: EVIDENCE
FROM ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY.

Archaeologists are increasingly interested in the dynamics of intra-settlement spatial organization
as well as the total site context. This paper employs a combination of ethnographic, ethnoarchaeo-
logical, and archaeological data to gauge changing settlement organization within the South Amer-
indian tropical rain forest. A comparative approach, involving different societies of disparate adapta-
tions within related, but distinct, ecotones is utilized to develop two models of village and circum-
village spatial organization as well as to document a shift from the first to the second in response to
raiding. The possibility of change between the models supports an over-arching “‘meta-model” of the
organization of space in the lowlands.(27)

THE SOCIAL ROLE OF COMMODITIES: AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF ARIKARA TRADE.

In the early historic period the Arikara, a horticultural group in South Dakota, participated in an
international trading system dealing in furs and other commodities. With the advent of the fur trade
and its special brand of economics and interaction, Arikara modes of artifact preference and usage
acquired new dimensions not completely like any previous system. Within the framework of contact,
there were transformations of the dialectic of interaction. The changing composition of artifact
assemblages from excavated Arikara sites suggests a complex set of interactions associat ed with the
selective adoption or rejection of Euro-American trade goods, (40)

ranges and computers has revealed details that indicate that several art styles are present, implying
that the paintings were done at different times. One composition of four figures exhibits motifs that
reflect aspects of Mississippian and Caddoan ideologies, as well as indicating ties with loway and

GEOARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SANTA/CHAO REGION, NORTHERN PERU: ALTERATIONS IN
LANDSCAPE, CLIMATE, AND HUMAN OCCUPATIONS.

In the Santa/Chao region of the Peruvian north coast, several interacting geomorphic and climatic
factors have been observed in association with prehistoric human occupations. The coast has pro-
graded by circa 5 km in the past 5000 years due to tectonic uplift and beach ridge formation. The
beach ridges which emanate from the mouth of the Santa River may record flooding episodes associated
with major prehistoric El Nios. Nearby middens associated with a fossil beach date to 5000 B.P. and
have a worm-water fauna. These changes in the topography and climate of the Santa/Chao area caused
significant alterations in the prehistoric settlement patterns and resource utilization. (6)

TRANSHUMANCE PATTERNS IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL ANDES.

The study of patterns of transhumance in the South Central Andes - southern Peru, northern Chile,
and northwestern Argentina - has led to the discovery of several different expressions adapted to
“micro-ecological zones’. One, a case with less seasonal emphasis, focuses on hunting in the highland
“dry puna” niche. This contrasts with a more seasonal model of the “desert puna” with emphasis on
hunting and gathering, centered along the incised pre-cordilleran valleys. Both basic patterns are still
in practice in the Aymara annual cycles of pastoralism. (Illustrative materials are provided).(49)

ARCTIC HUNTER-GATHERERS.

Recent surveys and excavations in the central Canadian Arctic indicate substantial changes in
Thule Eskimo site type frequencies, regional and local site distributions, and faunal characteristics

from the ‘classic’ Thule Eskimo period (ca. A.D. 1000-1400) to the: ‘modified’ Thule-historic Eskimo
period (ca. A.D. 1400-1900), These changes are shown to correspond to a shift from a subsistence-
settlement system based on collecting strategies (sensu Binford) to one based on foraging strategies,
and are seen as a response to a decrease in the predictability and abundance of both bowhead whales
and barren ground caribou resulting from deteriorating climatic conditions.{12)

WARP, WEFT, PATTERN AND HUE: AESTHETIC ISSUES IN THE INTERACTION OF LUXURY
CLOTH TRADITIONS.

Luxury cloth traditions mobilize labor, materials, capital and ideas to produce fabrics of aesthetic
reputation that, historically, participated in the formation and interaction of polities. Awesome
indices of rank, spectacular accessories to ritual, coveted gifts for exacting and rewarding loyalty,
luxury cloths also enhanced diplomatic missions and earned foreign exchange. Power holders, how-
ever, had to worry that the cloths on which they relied for these purposes would be upstaged by rival
fabrics, whose production and distribution were beyond their control. In considering this problem, it
helps to identify the parameters that drove interacting cloth makers in particular aesthetic directions
as they rivaled each other in creating luxury cloth.(8)

THE LOGIC OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL POLLEN ANALYSIS.

Pollen of sediment samples from archaeological sites has the same botanical and statistical char-
acteristics as the pollen of other deposits, so is traditionally interpreted by the same logical operations
that apply to biological inclusions in geological strata. One can argue, however, that these qualities
of site-context pollen spectra are less significant than their archaeological characteristics of context
and direct and indirect association with artifactual information. Archaeological pollen analysis accepts
this argument and proceeds to the conclusion that site-context pollen spectra should logically be
treated as arrays of archaeological data. Archaeological pollen analysis also recognizes a continuous,
systemic relationship between cultural activities and the biological context in which they are embed-
ded.(43)

DIFFUSION VS. EVOLUTION: AN OLD DEBATE AND A CURRENT PROBLEM.

Recent efforts to model processes of intersocietal interaction are hampered by a persistent debate
in anthropology. This controversy poses two unrealistically simple alternatives to explaining social
change: either as the result of contact with other societies (diffusion) or adaptation to the physical
environment (evolution). Related issues concern questions of the primacy of historical accident or
behavioral laws in governing processes of change. The present paper explores the development of this
debate in the mid-20th century and considers its implications for current studies of the relationship
between intersocietal contact and local social change.(8}

THE INKA OCCUPATION OF THE PROVINCE OF LUCANAS, PERU,

An archaeological survey of the territory of the Andamarca Lucanas yields evidence of the Inka
occupation of the province of Lucanas. The Inka occupation may be distinguished archaeologically
from the pre-Inka local culture on the basis of changes in settlement patterns, intervalley road
networks, styles of architecture, and ceramics, Ethnohistoric documents are used to provide details
not visible archaeologically; the archaeological data suggest that in some respects the ethnohistoric
documents are not entirely accurate.(41)

PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS FOR RESEARCH INTO THE LATER ARCHAIC OF SOUTHERN
ONTARIO.

In their investigations into the 10,000 year prehistory of southern Ontario, archaeologists have
largely bypassed the Archaic for the historical richness of the Late Woodland or the temporal pnority
of the Palco-Indian period. In contrast to the abundance and ubiquity of Archaic (surface) finds, the
poverty of research into the Archaic is striking. This has been due partly to data limitations, perceived
and actual, but more importantly to the absence of clearly defined research objectives. Recent publi-
cations plus personal experience through test excavations at two promising locations have served to
highlight this contradiction. This paper will attempt to resolve this dilemma by suggesting realistic
research directions appropriate to data of the Archaic.(33)

THE EARLY HISTORIC SENECA: SETTLEMENT PATTERNS AND DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS.

Artifactual, osteological and mortuary evidence from several early Seneca sites is examined for its
potential to provide insights into Seneca settlement patterns. The study is based on the extensive
collection of materials currently under investigation by the members of the Seneca Archaeology
Project at the Rochester Museum. Issues considered here include the substantial population increase
and consolidation of the late 16th century and the processes underlying it. Concerning the composition
of the Seneca population, tentative conclusions are offered regarding local precursor populations;
interaction and affiliation with neighboring Iroquoian groups; and the possible assimilation of war
captives.(36)

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF MANNERS.

This paper will examine the development of manners and the material culture associated with
them from the late Medieval times in Europe to early nineteenth century Annapolis, Maryland.
Civility, as it was known in the eighteenth century, was considered by philosophers, such as Voltaire,
to be embedded in nature. The emergence of this world view Jed to an increasingly stratified society
which used fine-tuned signals of behavior and the consumption of different types and amounts of
material culture to maintain social segmentation between classes while still creating a common
denominator of standardized behaviors. This research is grounded in an extensive survey of courtesy
and etiquette literature, probate inventories, and the archaeological record from Annapolis, Mary-
land.(29)

PATTERNS OF PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION: A STONE TOOL EXCHANGE

NETWORK FROM THE EASTERN MAYA LOWLANDS.

- Throughout the Late Preclassic and Classic periods a system of interpolity stone tool exchange

operated in the eastern portion of the Maya Lowlands. Substantive data from the tool-producing
‘ community of Colha and the tool-consuming communities around Pulltrouser Swamp are presented.

The organization of this specialized production is characterized as is the role of Colha in a regional

settlement hierarchy. The consumer role of Pulltrouser Swamp is documented using settlement and

lithic data. The structure and stability of this interpolity exchange network are discussed.(40)

SANITIZED FOR YOUR PROTECTION: ON THE ROAD WITH FEDERAL AND STATE

ARCHAEOLOGY.

Implementation of the National Archaeological Data Base Project in 14 states is described. The
project, sponsored by the National Park Service and designed to provide a planning tool for federal
agencies, necessitated many months of data acquisition in State Historic Preservation Offices. Per-
sonal recording of over 8000 cultural resource reports in the computerized, annotated bibliography
provided a unique perspective on the evolution of contract archaeology in the United States. The
success of compliance archaeology is considered in the light of economic constraints and the call to
problem-oriented research.(54)

ACCENTUATION OF INEQUALITY IN ESKIMO WHALING SOCIETIES DURING EARLY

CONTACT.

A native economy based upon whale hunting led to a hierarchical social system during the recent
prehistoric period on the Arctic coast of Alaska. Coastal Eskimo villages of up to 1300 people were
politically and religiously organized by umialiks (whaling captains) who operated out of karigis
(ceremonial centers) that they owned. Less important umialiks did not have karigis, but every whaling
captain was responsible for feeding the members of his whaling crew and their families, and all
participated to some extent in feeding the community in general. Native inequality was accentuated
during the early contact period, as umialiks traded baleen for Western goods.(58}

ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALOGY AND THE COPANECO ROYAL HOUSEHOLD.

Ethnographic descriptions relating to the internal differentiation of structure and function within
palaces and royal households in various societies in Afnca, Southeast Asia, the Pacific and the
Americas are compared. The comparative data form the basis for generating a composite model of
palaces and royal households in chiefdom and state-level societies. The model is then employed to
interpret the archaeological data pertaining to the Main Group of Copan, the presumed royal household
at this Late Classic Maya center in western Honduras.(45)

ECONOMIES OF DEPENDENCY OR SELF-SUFFICIENCY IN EL SALVADOR AND COSTA RICA.

The largely egalitarian societies of Costa Rica, with their low population densities, contrast with
the more complex Salvadoran societies with greater population densities and instabilities. Costa
Rican villages achieved relative independence in productive and extractive resources. In contrast,
Salvadoran villages fell under dependency relationships, having to rely on exchange tor distant, needed
commodities. Intra-settlement specialization resulted in lesser familial self-sufficiency. Dittenng
exchange systems have significant implications for societal longevity.(40)

SOURCING OF EARLY NEOLITHIC AND MESOLITHIC CHERTS AND RHYOLITES FROM
SOUTHERN PORTUGAL.

As part of a joint Portuguese/Canadian research project on the Mesolithic/Neolithic transition in
Southern Portugal, a programme of lithic raw material sourcing using INAA and petrographic analysis
has been established. The raw materials from three Early Neolithic/Mesolithic sites and two geological
sources have been analyzed. Results of this preliminary work have shown that rhyolites as well as

cherts were extensively used by coastal hunter-gatherers in the production of microlithic tool kits.
The study of geological materials has demonstrated that the rhyolite is found 20 km inland. This
information may provide support for seasonal movement of coastal populations.| 16}

SICAN METALLURGY: “HOLISTIC” UNDERSTANDING AND THE ROLE OF
ARCHAEOMETRY.

Nine years’ research has yielded perhaps the most comprehensive, integrated picture of any ancient
technological system in the New World - that of the Sican copper alloy metallurgy (A.D. 850-1532)
of the northern Peruvian coast. Our “holistic” understanding encompasses technological, behavioral,
organizational, and ideological aspects of mining, smelting, metalworking, and the use and distribu-
tion of final products. Data derive from an interdisciplinary approach incorporating field experiments
utilizing local materials, reconstructed and original furnaces, and complementary archaeometric
techniques. From the vantage of such a unique perspective, extant views on “culture and technology”’
and the role of archaeometry in archaeology are assessed.(32)

TECHNOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION IN GREAT LAKES PALEO-INDIAN ASSEMBLAGES.

Lithic assemblages were crafted for task performance, but their form and content reflect other
cultural behavior as well. Stone tools, in short, tell us about more than how stone tools were made

and used. This premise underlies organizational analyses, which infer nonmaterial aspects of cultural
systems (e.g., mobility, the way in which risk is distributed socially) from sparse material remains.
Study of Gainey and Parkhill Phase Paleo-Indian sites in the Great Lakes demonstrates the value of
an organizational approach to the inference of mobility. Technological indices—diversity, versatility,
curation rate—are related systematically to mobility among these groups.|46)

MANIPULATION OF SOIL AND WATER IN THE XERIC ENVIRONMENTS OF LOWLAND EL
ORO, ECUADOR.

Past resource use is under investigation south of the Guayas estuary (E) Tahuin Project). Agriculture
in periodically inundated depressions has a long history, Air photo analysis, ground reconnaissance
and test excavations indicate related or antecedent expedients. Hundreds of previously undocumented
and apparently artificial shallow circular depressions dot the Tertiary sediments between stream
valleys. Removal of sandy topsoil exposes clay; the resulting pans retain open water long after the
rains, favor useful plants and attract deer. They promise a new perspective on ancient subsistence in
coastal Ecuador.(28)

IS NASCA 8 NASCA?

Although the Nasca ceramic style of the south coast of Peru is seriated into nine phases, the
penultimate phase, Nasca 8, exhibits so many discontinuities with the previous phases and so many
foreign attributes as to make its current style designation a misnomer. The Nasca 8 loss of important
and diagnostic Nasca vessel shapes, demise of mythical iconography, and notable technological decline
are explained in terms of dramatic changes in the sociopolitical milieu of the Nasca region. These
both coincide with the rise of the Wari state in the adjacent Ayacucho highlands and emerge out of
the increased militarization, hierarchization, and economic expansion of late Nasca society. The
Nasca 8 relative and absolute chronology are discussed and the iconography of the phase is illustrated.
The possible causes of the ritual entombment of a temple room at the early Nasca site of Cahuachi
by Nasca 8 people are assessed_{13)

SITE FORMATION AT THE ABRI VAUFREY (DORDOGNE, FRANCE).

Recent analyses of spatial patterns, along with studies of artifacts, faunal materials, and sediments,
show a complex set of factors leading to the formation of couche VIII (Mousterian) from the Abri
Vaufrey. It is evident that both humans and non-human predators contributed to the patterning
observed to differing degrees; the precise contribution of each agent is the focus of spatial analysis.
Based on analyses of spatial cluster contents, it is argued that while non-human predators scavenged

* the deposit, humans were the primary agents producing observed spatial configurations.(44}

primarily on the site itself, and have yielded tremendous amounts of new data on neolithic life.
However, we know little of the surrounding area in terms of settlement and land-use patterns. A

temper, are presented. This study made use of materials science techniques to compare the perfar-

mance characteristics of untempered, mineral, and organic-tempered briquettes and vessels. Among

the properties tested are impact resistance, abrasion resistance, portability, thermal shock resistance, |
and heating effectiveness. Organic-tempered ceramics are superior in portability and this may explain

the preference for such pots by nonsedentary peoples. Moreover, it is found that all low-fired ceramics,

but especially organic-tempered ceramics are susceptible to complete breakdown in a moist environ-

ment under freezing conditions. Frost-wedging is not only thought to be responsible for an underes-

timation of Late Archaic organic-tempered ceramics in the northern latitudes, but also the destruction

of any low-fired pottery subject to a moist depositional environment and freezing temperatures.(50}

effects of age disparity on the interpretation of a large suite of radiocarbon dates from Black Mesa
Basketmaker II sites. An investigation of the distribution of wood age on Black Mesa historic-period

European explorers such as Hernando de Soto and Juan Pardo, indirect trade from aboriginal group to

Archaeologists have generally recognized the important role of storage in the development of

not only to suggest new directions for recognizing storage, but also to provide a means to monitor
status differences and agricultural intensity,(27)

to population ratios, warrior to population ratio, catchment size, and hectares per person under
cultivation. Variables include length of village occupation, village population size, longhouse length,
migration, and occupation dates. The definition of constants and our increasing control of variables

HUMAN DIET AT PECOS PUEBLO.

Between AD 1450 and 1600, the agriculturalists at Pecos exchanged corn for bison meat with Plains
dwelling hunter-gatherers. Analysis of bone strontium levels and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope
rations of bone collagen indicate that the meat:vegetable and corn:non-com ratios of diet were
relatively stable throughout this period. The delta-15N values of human bone collagen and of diet
components (corn, beans, bison) suggest that in terms of calories, the diet was 75% com, 15% beans,
and 10% meat. A check using the delta-13C values supports this estimation. This diet should have
been adequate in protein and other required nutrients.{7)

PATTERNING IN PALEOINDIAN BEHAVIOR: THE MICHAUD SITE.
The Michaud site is a completely excavated, short-term fluted-point Paleoindian site preserving 8
minimally disturbed activity loci. Dominant raw materials are red Munsungun cherts from northern
Maine, a glassy rhyolite apparently from the Neponset river basin south of Boston, and a series of
cherts from sources south of Burlington, Vermont. Two types of chert dominate in one group of 3
loci, and the Neponset rhyolite dominates the other 5. Each group of loci exhibits spatial patterning
differences which indicate differences in social organization of the inhabitants. Reconstructions of
tool curation and manufacturing strategy have been elicited by flake examination and refitting. These
data suggest variable Paleoindian movement patterns between the widely separated lithic source
areas, and a number of socially differing adaptations to short or long term temporally varying resources.(46)

that the Inka established an artisan settlement at Milliraya, recruiting 1,000 weavers and 100 potters
from the surrounding area. The analysis presented focuses on interpreting surface collected material
from Milliraya within the context of information, derived from archival sources, on the organization
and administration of production. Particular stress is placed on 1) the archaeological visibility of
ceramic production, and 2) the combination of Inka and local-altiplano stylistic elements and vessel
forms.(41}

The spatial distribution of three variables recorded for vertebrate faunal remains from a domestic
structure at Real Alto, Ecuador, is examined to assess a proposed contextual reconstruction of Early
Formative household space. The differential patterning of size, density, and weight classes, in the face
of a number of identifiable and/or potential taphonomic agents, suggests a biased distribution of bone

habitation debris, but rather are the result of a single episodic event involving house construction
and household burial. The consequences of such activities for site formation processes and ceramic
seriation in Valdivia sites are discussed.(28)

SIZE AND COMPLEXITY IN CORE AREA TIWANAKU SETTLEMENTS.

The nature of core area Tiwanaku sites remains obscure due largely to a lack of regional settlement
data and a prior research focus on civic-ceremonial architecture. This paper utilizes data from two
major Tiwanaku IV and V period sites, Lukurmata and Pajchiri. Both sites include residential and
non-residential areas greater than 1.5 km? with dense concentrations of elite and non-elite domestic
occupations near the ceremonial center, as well as along peripheral, raised field agricultural zones.
Utilizing intensive surface survey and mapping data, this paper assesses existing models of Tiwanaku
settlement size and complexity, and proposes two refined models for the southern Titicaca basin.(52!

DECLINING RESIDENTIAL MOBILITY IN THE LOWER PATUXENT DRAINAGE, MARYLAND.

Regional survey data are used to investigate the transition from mobile to sedentary lifeways in
coastal Maryland between 4000 B.C. and A.D. 1600. The evidence suggests that Late Archaic and
Early Woodland populations were small and fairly mobile. It was not until the Middle Woodland that
several changes took place that may indicate greater sedentism and a shift to “logistical” resource
procurement. These are: (1) pronounced functional differentiation among tool assemblages, (2) an
increase in the relative frequency of ‘‘special-purpose’’ sites; and (3) an increase in artifact density
, 124 Stevenson, Christopher M.
within sites. Although the reasons for this apparent decline in mobility are not fully understood, the
intensification of alliance networks, evidenced by a tremendous increase in lithic exchange, may have
created a need for storage facilities, which in turn would have provided an incentive for greater
residential permanence.(12)

WHAT NOW! BEYOND THE FORMATION OF HEARTH ASSOCIATED LITHIC
DISTRIBUTIONS.

Much current dissatisfaction with processual archacology has risen in response to our inability to
forge linkages between middle range theory and general theories of human behaviour and oganization.
Employing site formation theory, this paper explores a small part of the inferential potential of lithic
distributions around intensively utilized hearths. Assuming that size sorting, embedding, and edge
damage in such contexts are time dependent, the potential of such lithic distributions to illuminate

changes through time in resource exploitation and gender relationships is examined. Although the
middle range and general theories presented here are in their infancy, this paper demonstrates that
the New archaeology is not dead, only harder than we imagined.(44}

Peoples of the Parkhill complex showed a strong preference for a distinctive “type’’ of white chert.
Geological studies indicate that this chert is from the Fossil Hill Formation and is restricted to a
limited number of outcrops in the southern Georgian Bay region. This and other evidence suggests
that Parkhill complex peoples occupied a prescribed territory encompassing the southern Lake Huron
and southern Georgian Bay regions. Evidence of territoriality from elsewhere in North America

indicates that Early Paleo-Indian population movements were more complex than allowed by the
concept of “free wandering”’.(46)

THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM IN IBERIA: AN INTERREGIONAL COMPARISON.

The Last Glacial Maximum was a time of significant cultural developments in the coastal regions
of the Iberian Peninsula, Cantabria, Levant and Portugal saw apparent increases in population (perhaps
in part due to human abandonment of northern Europe at the height of the Upper Pleniglacial),
although the high, harsh mesetas of central Iberia were apparently sparsely/intermittently occupied.
The period of 21-17,000 BP corresponds to the Solutrean of Spain, Portugal and Southern France,
which is characterized by increasingly sophisticated, complex technologies, settlement patterns and
subsistence strategies. It heralds the appearance of truly ‘modern’ hunter-gatherer adaptations in the
late Upper Paleolithic, 15,000 years after the appearance of anatomically modern humans in Western
Europe.{20)

CACHE POINT (NhTs-2) AND MACKENZIE INUIT PREHISTORY.

The lower East Channel of the Mackenzie River in western Arctic Canada was the centre of a highly
specialized Eskimo adaptation. Excavations at Cache Point have extended the cultural sequence back
to ca. AD 1400 with three main results. First, the local cultural pattern was always focused on beluga
hunting and fishing. Second, it is now clear that the Mackenzie Inuit were part of the Western Thule
tradition. Third, there is evidence for phases within the Mackenzie sequence which reflect both local
conditions and sustained contact with neighbouring Thule groups.{12)

A DISCUSSION OF RADIOCARBON AGE CALIBRATION.

A conventional radiocarbon age of a sample is derived from the ratio of the currently remaining
radiocarbon activity to its radiocarbon activity when part of a living organism. The latter activity is
estimated by assuming identical radiocarbon specific activity, after correction for isotope tractiona-
tion, for all living organisms over the entire interval for which radiocarbon dating is applicable. Thus,
the correctness of a radiocarbon age not only depends on the precision and accuracy of the laboratory
measurement but also on the extent to which the assumption of constancy of past radiocarbon levels
is met. The importance of these factors on radiocarbon age calibration will be discussed (23)

“EMERGENT MISSISSIPPIAN” AND ITS PARADIGM: THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE CAIRO
LOWLAND.

The concept of “Emergent Mississippian’ requires a stage-like perspective of prehistory. We exam-
ine this concept and the extent to which it promotes the scientific understanding of the late prehistory
of Eastern North America. Our reservations are illustrated with data from the Cairo Lowland and
comparisons with the American Bottom and northeastern Arkansas sequences, We conclude that the
scientific understanding of Mississippian societies will benefit greatly from avoiding concepts like
“Emergent Mississippian” and its underlying paradigm.(10)

THE ORIGINS AND OPERATION OF THE NORTHERN MAORI CHIEFDOMSHIP.

Current reconstructions of northern Maori sociopolitical organization are based on nineteenth
century descriptions and cross-cultural comparisons with the classic Polynesian chiefdoms. The
historic descriptions post-date fundamental changes in Maori society. The comparative approach has
masked the distinctiveness of pre-European Maori culture. Research in Central Northland has shown
that economy there was based on geographically separated resources: inland gardens and coastal
fishing. It involved the seasonal coastal-inland movement of family groups (whanau). These formed
subtribal units (hapu). The size and composition of hapu oscillated over time. Leadership was based
on consensus, not the authority of political office. This consensus was reached within a complex
hierarchy of values in which age, gender, descent and action were pre-and/or partial determinants of
rank. The tribal organization of Northern Maori society, and th large scale chiefdomship there, are
recent phenomena.(55)

THE SECOND WURMIAN PLENIGLACIAL IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA.

1, Early Pleniglacial adaptations (28-23000 B.P.). The Pavlovian (Gravettian) of Moravia provides
behavioral innovations (settlement concentration in large stations; specialization in food economy;
imports of lithic materials), 2. Evolved Pleniglacial adaptations (23-20000 B.P.). The settlement centers
shift from Moravia to Slovakia. Kostenkian tool-types become more frequent. 3. Pleniglacial maxi-
mum and recession (20-15000 B.P.). No evidence of settlement is proved in Czechoslovakia, but scarce
occupation in S Poland could mediate contacts with E Europe. The Gravettian continues to evolve in
Hungary and the Balkans. 4. Late Glacial colonisation (after 15000 B.P.), Moravia has been resettled
by the Late Gravettian and Bohemia and Moravia by the Magdalenian. Cultural change from the East
European-oriented Pavlovian to the Magdalenian with Franco-Cantabrian affiliation was the main
consequence.(20)

A SKEPTICAL VIEW OF HISTORIC PRESERVATION PLANNING.

That cultural resource management faces challenges is a fact widely known and intensely debated.
Very often it is suggested that the solution to most or all CRM problems is preservation planning.
Planning is thought to be a panacea for the vagaries of such diverse activities as deciding survey levels,
evaluating significance, and making preservation decisions. This paper evaluates the planning approach
from the perspectives of the philosophy and the sociology of science, and raises questions about the
usefulness of long-range planning,(54)

REGAL-RITUAL RESIDENCES AND ADMINISTRATIVE HUBS: DIFFERENTIAL STRUCTURE

AND FUNCTION AMONG THE MAJOR CENTERS OF THE UPPER BELIZE VALLEY.

Recent characterizations of large-scale Classic Lowland Maya centers reflect increasing interpretive
sophistication. Superseding the vacant “ceremonial center” are now the populated or vacant “orga-
nizational center,” “civic center,” or “major center.” As yet, however, there exist few attempts to
differentiate these other than by size and architectonic élaborateness. Using urban anthropological
concepts, two functionally and morphologically distinct major center types are identified within the
same Belize Valley sociopolitical realm. These are described and their implications for overall societal
organization are considered. The probable existence of yet a third functionally distinct type at nearby
Naranjo is also discussed.(57)

CHRONOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF CERAMIC PASTE VARIABILITY IN MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPI CERAMICS FROM SOUTHEAST MISSOURL,

Ceramics from the County Line Settlement in southeast Missouri reveal substantial use of clay
temper, (ordinarily associated with earlier Baytown ceramics), and a wider range of paste preparation
than previously recognized for Middle Mississippi ceramics. Since the distribution of Baytown ceram-
ics does not extend to this particular area, the manner in which broad shifts in ceramic temper have
become embedded into many eastern U.S. chronological frameworks must be questioned. Perhaps
useful as a broad scale time marker, ceramic temper is a functional dimension and unlike style,
cannot be expected to vary unidirectionally through time.(50)

CHARACTERISTICS AND INTER-REGIONAL LINKAGE OF PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT
REMAINS OF PUTUSHIO (SOUTHERN ECUADOR).

The site, situated in the upper dry valley of Rio Jubones, was occupied for more than three thousand
years with a complex settlement pattern with extensive terrace-building, water systems, remainders
of houses and edifices, a large metallurgical workshop probably for gold smithing, and signs of mining
activities. Remains from the late Formative and Regional Development periods are related to cultures
of Pacific coast areas as well as to the wider surrounding highland region, and show a peculiar affinity
to Narrio cultures.(28)

Variability in biology, language, and culture within the Fijian archipelago has usually been attributed
to a single cause or process: the historical inheritance of particular traits |with diffenng amounts of

is in progress to assess the relative and undoubtedly variable weight of a number of potential contrib-

communication and marriage migration, as well as historical contact and intermigration with external
populations.(55)

EXPLORATIONS INTO THE LAPITA DECLINE.

The elaboration of social complexity in West Polynesia may be linked to trading relationships of
prestige items through monopoly. Such relationships were facilitated by geographic distribution of
various island communities. The transformation of ceramics from common trade objects to restricted
status goods took place within the framework of these trade relationships. Change and continuity in
ceramic design motifs are examined within the context of similar processes observed in related design
motifs in other media.(55)

MESOAMERICAN ICONS AND MIMBRES MORTUARY VESSELS.

Iconographic interpretation based on comparative analysis of repeated motifs and attribute clusters
indicates painted Mimbres bowls reflect Panmesoamerican ideologies, mythic traditions and under-
world conceptions. Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic Mimbres figures are demonstrably cognate
with celestial bodies, culture heroes and chthonic beings known from southern, central and northern
Mesoamerica. Analysis of action in narrative scenes portrayed on both Classic Maya and Classic
Mimbres funerary ceramics illustrates: 1) structural relationships in mythic and metaphorical content
and 2) the importance, as well as the temporal, geographical and cultural extent, of Popol Vuh imagery.
The foregoing data are correlated with ethnographically recorded Pueblo mythology.(30)

THE ROLE OF PLAINS VILLAGERS IN THE POST-CONTACT MIDDLE MISSOURI TRADE
SYSTEM OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS.

The Middle Missouri fur trade was structured similarly to the central Canadian fur trade, but its
operation was somewhat different. The use of permanent villages as centers of trade and the intersec-
tion of the horse and gun frontiers in the Middle Missouri subarea allowed the Arikara, Hidatsa, and
Mandan to establish themselves as preeminent middleman traders during the early post-contact
period, From this position the villagers effectively controlled the flow of European commodities
between eastern and westem nomadic groups. The pivotal role of the villagers in the trade system
was lost with the establishment of local trading posts,(40)

The paper will discuss Inca installations (administrative center and storerooms), imposed settlements
related to the Inca presence (mitimae settlements), and the influence of Inca ceramics on the local
tradition, In this area architecture, especially storage facilities, appears to be a better indication of the
inca presence than ceramics. Both Inca and mitimae settlement are closely related to the major roads,
with less impact in more isolated areas.(41)

STONE TECHNOLOGY AS RISK MANAGEMENT.

Anthropologists exploring human strategies for coping with risk and uncertainty have overlooked
the important role of tool-using for solving problems which occur on very short time scales. Variability
in the nature of hunter-gatherer tool-kits as well as in patterns for the procurement of raw materials,
production, repair and discard of artifacts are explained as solutions to differences in the character
and severity of risk experienced. A comparison between parallel changes in the stone tool assemblages
of Europe and Australia illustrates how technological and social strategies co-operate to handle
different forms of risk.(9)

A QUANTITATIVE APPROACH TO THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SETTLEMENT PATTERNS

Settlement patterns within the Tehuacan Valley, Mexico, as reconstructed by MacNeish (1975),
are based primarily upon site distribution, area and function. As an alternative to the qualitative
identification of site function the Shannon Index is employed as a statistical measure ot assemblage
diversity. Presented are reconstructed settlement patterns within the Tehuacan Valley from the late
Pleistocene to the Middle Formative periods. Population dynamics, as a mobile subsistence system
moves towards sedentism, are discussed in light of the conceptual framework provided by Binford’s
(1982) model of hunter-gatherer subsistence settlement systems.(30)

NEW GOODS ON OLD ROUTES: EXCHANGE IN THE CONTACT ERA IN EASTERN NORTH

As Europeans contacted native peoples, new products were incorporated into prehistoric exchange
systems. The native response to European trade reflected fluctuating factors such as the nature and
accessibility of European goods and ideas, and the size, social structure, and health of native popula-
tions. Comparisons of contact era archaeological sites in eastern North America suggest that subregion
explanations are needed to accommodate varied diachronic exchange patterns. An example of a region
specific exchange model is presented for the Caddo Indians of the Red River in Arkansas between
A.D. 1500-1800.(40)

INTERACTION AND ISOLATION: THE EMPTY SPACES IN PAN-REGIONAL POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC SYSTEMS.

Many models of large scale political and economic systems, and especially those that emphasize
locational analyses, are based on conceptions of regional connectivity that presume interactive homo-
geneity within and between regions. The identification of population centers that were participating
in particular regional interactive networks is used as a kind of proxy currency for describing the
interactive patterns of entire regions. In this paper, the “nodal” approach to interaction is examined.
A single region on the southeastern periphery of the American Southwest is analyzed in relation to
its links to the local Casas Grandes regional system, to larger panregional Southwestern alliance
networks, and to the Mesoamerican world system.(8)

EASTER ISLAND MONOLITHIC STATUES AND THE SYMBOLIC DEPICTION OF RANK
DIFFERENTIAL.

Symbolic paradigms, when integrated with ecological, demographic, technological and socio-polit-
ical approaches, are relevant to the interpretation of the material record, producing synthetic expla-
nations of implied human behavior. Analysis of architectural and sculprural components of one major
ceremonial site on Easter Island incorporates concepts of monumentality, successive use, directional
symbolism and temporal change in the characteristics of monolithic statue type. The result of the
integration of this symbolic paradigm with existing ecological, demographic and structural data is a
re-evaluation of the nature of social hierarchy and a re-interpretation of the statue as symbolic of
more than one aspect of that hierarchy.(55)

HOLOCENE AGE PALEOSOL DEVELOPMENT AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE LOCATION.

Recent archaeological and geoarchaeological investigations conducted by Vento and Fitzgibbons
(1986) in northcentral Pennsylvania document a correlation between the presence of buried Late
Holocene age paleosols and the occurrence of archacological sites. The pedogenic development of
paleosols on Holocene-age low terraces along levees in floodplain contexts within the Upper Susque-
hanna River drainage basin documents past episodes of fluvial stability during cooler-moister climatic
conditions. Late Holocene hiatuses in overbank deposition allowed for relatively long term aboriginal
utilization of these terrace surfaces and subsequent A-horizon development. Paleosols when encoun-
tered may serve as stratigraphic time lines.(43)

THE DOMESTIC USE OF SPACE AT THIRD MILLENNIUM KURBAN HYK.

Recent ethnoarchaeological investigations of Middle Eastern village households have highlighted
the way in which the daily sweeping of rooms and courtyards and daily cleaning of hearths and ovens,
combined with the removal of ash and debris some distance from domestic compounds, makes
distinguishing use areas on the basis of artifact distribution extremely difficult. In this study, archi-
tectural features recovered from the final Bronze Age occupation of Kurban Hoyik in southeastern
Turkey are compared with similar features of contemporary village architecture to determine their
function. These results are tested against functions suggested by the distribuuion of artifacts during
this phase.(3)

DIVERSITY IN HUNTER-GATHERER SETTLEMENTS IN THE SUSQUEHANNA VALLEY OF

Systematic survey of the Susquehanna Valley during planning of Interstate 88 in New York provided

intra-site and regional data to address hunter-gatherer subsistence and settlement patterns. This paper
, focuses on one method of differentiating sites prior to regional modeling. The dimension of site size

was plotted with artifact diversity and artifact cluster diversity (using Kintigh’s method) to charac-

terize sites along a simple to complex continuum. The resulting classification is interpreted within

the context of forager/collector strategies. This interpretation has implications for how hunter-

gatherer sites are distributed along a major river valley and an upland tributary.(34)

MORE PROBLEMS WITH ARCHAEOMETRIC SOURCING OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL

CERAMICS.

Most archaeological ceramics have a high porosity, a property which encourages absorption. It
seemed possible, therefore, that, in the course of burial and chemical weathering, ceramic objects
might absorb additional clay minerals and trace elements from the surrounding sediments and ground
water to an extent that would distort archaeometric fingerprints of their original raw materials.
Controlled experiments, using x-ray diffractometry and trace element spectrochemical analyses of
known material before and after simulated burial and weathering, confirm that this is the case.
Archaeologists can no longer assume that the archaeometric fingerprint of a ceramic object is the
fingerprint of the original raw materials.(50)

PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE FOR DIACHRONIC CHANGES IN CURATION HABITS AT BOKER

Paleolithic transitional site of Boker Tachtit (Central Negev, Israel) have provided preliminary evi-

_ ee
, Warrick, Gary A. 131
dence for the differential curatorial treatment given some lithic artifact and tool classes. As a result,
some tool class productions are spatially separated from others. These data also provide some insights
into diachronic changes in curation habits, since the site’s four primary context levels span a tech-
nologically transitional period. Early in the transition, the reconstructions show that cores were
probably curated more often than tools. In the latter part of the transition, this pattern is reversed.
These spatial patterns provide supportive intrasite data for a model of diachronic environmental
adaptation and change proposed for the southern Levant.{9)

layer held between layers of amorphous, or crypto-crystalline, deposits originating from ground water
seepage. These silcrete, or calcrete, layers frequently occur in parallel, rhythmic bands. They preserve
rock paintings until increased thickness obscures the art and causes pigment loss. Frost weathering
and lichen growth are discussed and dismissed as dating techniques. Specific examples of pictograph

THE CANADIAN CULTURAL PROPERTY EXPORT AND IMPORT ACT.

The Canadian Cultural Property Export and Import Act was passed in 1977 to better ensure the
preservation in Canada of the best examples of the nation’s cultural, historic and scientific heritage,
and to prevent the uncontrolled export of cultural property in the national treasure category. The
export of such property is controlled through regulations which define the age and value limits of
categories of objects subject to control. Import controls are also included which prohibit the import
into Canada of cultural property illegally exported from other countries which are signatories to the
1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the licit Import, Export and
Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. As well, the legislation contains special tax incentives
to encourage individuals to sell or donate their national treasures to Canadian institutions.(2)

OPTICAL METALLOGRAPHY: METAL ARTIFACTS THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS.

When a metallic artifact can be sampled, properly prepared and examined in the optical microscope
its microstructure can be quite revealing: whether it is native metal or smelted metal, and, if smelted,
what was the nature of the smelting process; whether it was cast or worked, whether it was worked
hot or cold and, if heated, the maximum temperature reached and cooling rate. Microstructures which
result from improper sample preparation, or from corrosion, can be misleading. This presentation will
illustrate some successes and pitfalls in the interpretation of microstructures of metal artifacts.(53)

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF DIETARY CHANGES OBSERVED ON HOLOCENE
ABORIGINAL SHELL MIDDENS IN NEW SOUTH WALES.

Two mid-Holocene age shell middens were excavated at Merimbula, NSW. Both document a shift,
between 3500 and 2500 BP, from oysters to cockles as the preferred species predated. Similar shifts
in preferred shell fish collected are widely documented in Australia, but both the environmental and
cultural explanations put forward for these dietary changes are controversial. It will be argued that at
Merimbula, at least, the change in shellfish eaten was environmentally, not culturally, determined.
The implications of this evidence for changes in local conditions will be discussed.(25)

The study of warfare is particularly important because of the various forms of regional interaction:

stresses in Maya society which were difficult or impossible to resolve, and to variations inherent in
Maya society which are obscured by our traditional perspective which emphasizes a monolithic view
of Maya elite culture. The attitudes of several generations of Maya scholars concerning the interpre-

CENTRAL MEXICO’S INFLUENCES IN JALISCO AND NAYARIT DURING THE CLASSIC

HOLOCENE RECORD OF EL NI%O EVENTS AND EARLY AGRICULTURE IN THE RIO

deposits provide the potential for studying the effects of catastrophic flooding on the prehistoric
agricultural development of the Casma Valley. Preliminary results suggest 4 minimum of 5 major El
Nino events since the beginning of the ceramic and a minimum of at least 10 Preceramic or earlier
events.(6)

different kinds of social changes that took place within these groups provide instructive examples for
developing models of the potential role of interregional interaction in effecting profound cultural
change.(8)

NORTH AFRICA DURING THE LAST GLACIAL MAXIMUM.

The Sahara Desert was hyperarid and unpopulated at 18,000 B.P, The Nile Valley, the Maghreb,
and the intervening Mediterranean coast were occupied by the makers of backed bladelet industries
who belonged to the particular human type called 'Mechtoids”. These populations were well estab-
lished shortly before 20,000 B.P., but the archaeological record immediately before then is extremely
poor, and, for much of the area, blank.(20)

GERMANY AT 18,000 BP.

At this time Germany is lying right between the two ice frontiers less than 1000 km apart. This
bottleneck situation seems to produce such severe environmental conditions that a break in settle-
ment history is probable. The Gravettian occupation ends about 21,000 BP although sedimentation
continues in the sites, and the Magdalenian starts at 17,000 BP. Into this gap of about 3,000 years falls
only one site from Northern Germany dating to 18,100 BP. The sparse finds and the singularity of the
site suggest that man only sporadically entered the ‘dead zone’ between the glaciers during their
maximum expansion.{20)

THE EPIPALEOLITHIC-NEOLITHIC TRANSITION IN EGYPT'S FAYYUM OASIS.

The Fayyum contains Egypt's earliest and most extensive evidence of the use of domesticated
cereals and animals. Yet the origins of Fayyum cultures, their settlement and subsistence systems,
and the nature of the Epipaleolithic to Neolithic transition there have never been clearly established.
Recent research has provided evidence regarding these issues. Differences between Epipaleolithic and
Neolithic Fayyum economies are documented in terms of an analysis of the spatial distributions of
faunal remains and artifacts. Fayyum agricultural origins are placed in the context of general models
of agricultural origins.|14)

SMALL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION DURING THE LATE FORMATIVE IN OAXACA,
MEXICO.

Late Formative (ca. 300-100 B.C.) cultural systems of highland Mesoamerica have been studied
mostly at the regional level and at the tops of local settlement system hierarchies. We know much
less about the structure of small communities. Data from a minor Oaxacan site are used to identity
two aspects of this community’s internal and external organization: | 1) a status-graded set of household
units headed by an elite family, itself part of a valley-wide ruling stratum, and (2) workshop-level
ceramic production for supra-community consumption (30)

ISLANDS: MIRRORS OR MIRAGES OF CONTINENTS?

The environments of Pacific islands are, to various extents, the creations of their inhabitants. On
islands close to the Pleistocene continent of Sahul, it can be shown that the current wild mammalian
fauna is the result of a partial, deliberate, long-term re-creation of an original continental situation.
Data from New Ireland will substantiate this. Further east, differences increase with distance from |
the source continent, and deliberate (if not adventitious) changes are restricted to “domestic” fauna
and flora which are more directly under human control.(55)

PRODUCTION COMPLEXITY IN EARLY AURIGNACIAN BODY ORNAMENTATION: THE
CASE OF ABRI BLANCHARD AND LA SOUQUETTE.

Recent dissatisfaction with viewing the Middle/Upper Paleolithic transition as an all-or-nothing
rubicon has led to a desire to see the Aurignacian/Gravettian as transitional in complexity between
the Mousterian and the Solutrean/Magdalenian. This latter perspective is open to serious question
on empirical grounds. It is clearly demonstrable in the domains of art and body ornamentation, that
by 30,000 years ago complex production sequences existed for the manufacture of objects of a largely
social/symbolic nature. The analysis of several hundred ivory beads and pendants, as well as engraved
bone and antler objects from the prolific French Aurignacian I sites of Blanchard and La Souquette,
indicates a high degree of production complexity, standardization, and conventionalization. The
patterns observed are inconsistent with any notion of a simpler state of affairs in the Aurignacian
than after the Glacial Maximum.(4)

ETHNOGRAPHY OF COMMUNICATION AND ROCK ART STUDY IN THE ACTIVE VOICE.

Rock art is traditionally viewed as fossilized iconographic text, with interpretation focusing on
formal, stylistic or symbolic attributes of the iconography. In fact, rock art was produced by active
rituals, with the ritual serving as the primary medium of prehistoric communication, Rock art images
are thus secondary and passive remnants of prehistoric ceremony. Ethnography of communication
provides a model for the archaeological study of the prehistoric rituals that resulted in rock art,
allowing for anthropological inferences about the function and context of it. Analyses of sites from
eastern California illustrate this methodological approach and the inferences that can be derived
therefrom.(38)

Studies of archaeological pit features and their contents have been limited by a lack of understanding
of deposit formation. A year-long experiment utilizing 15 artificial pits was conducted along the

snails in pits. Species entrapment varied according to season, temperature, rainfall, and variables of
pit content and structure. Empirical data for analyzing archaeological deposit formation, site bioe-
cology, and occupation seasonality are provided and considered in the analysis of archaeological pit
features from the eastern United States.(15)

An analytical framework for understanding technological responses to contextual variations is

assemblages are derived from the model and previous research. Two case studies (see Hassen, this

Woodland chipped-stone artifact assemblages from functionally different sites with different access
to lithic resources. Both debitage and shaped artifacts are analyzed from a technological perspective.
Differences in the assemblages are attributable to variations in adaptive response.(9)

RESEARCH UPDATE FROM EXCAVATIONS AT TOWOSAHGY STATE HISTORIC SITE.

Extensive testing at Towosahgy, originally called Beckwith’s Fort, has revealed some interesting
information about the association between this large Mississippian Period, temple mound site (ca.
A.D. 1000) and a nearby hamlet in the state park. Recent test excavations just outside the southern
fortification line supply insight for reconstructing the environmental setting on the periphery of this
temple mound center and the existence of a small hamlet. The tentative association of the Mississip-
pian temple mound center to a hamlet just outside its walls gives new insights for settlement pattern
analysis on Pinhook Ridge in Southeast Missouri. The Mississippian expression in this area may have
had antecedents from an in situ Late Woodland base, which is especially noticeable in the southern

half of Towosahgy.(| 10)

ARCHAEOLOGY, TECHNOLOGY, AND PUBLIC POLICY.

The efficient use of techniques, equipment, and methods is critical to cost effective management
of our cultural resources. If advanced technologies are to assume a greater role in archaeology, it is
crucial to find more effective means of transferring technology developed in other fields to archaeology
and historic preservation. A federally-funded national Center for Preservation Technology could
coordinate research, disseminate information, and provide training about new technologies. This
paper discusses options for such a center and presents other major findings of OTA’s recent report on
Technologies for Prehistoric and Historic Preservation.(54)

EARLY IROQUOIANS: PEOPLE IN TRANSITION,

Recent archaeological surveys and excavations in southern Ontario, conducted within a regional
settlement framework that allows for the examination of functional variability in the use of sites,
demonstrate that Early froquoians had mixed economies involving both horticulture and a consider-
able reliance on naturally-occurring subsistence resources. Their settlement-subsistence strategies
can therefore be seen to differ significantly from those documented for either earlier hunter-gatherers
or Late Iroquoians. This suggests that the economic and socio-political organization of Iroquoian
society developed over a much longer period than was previously thought.(33)

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES AS CHEMICAL SYSTEMS.

The consideration of archaeological sites as definable chemical systems extends the practice of
archaeometry from that of the investigation of objects in isolation. Studies at ancient Egyptian sites
will be used to illustrate how computational, analytical and physical techniques can be used to
investigate ongoing physico-chemical processes. The information obtained from this approach to the
study of ancient materials is of immediate interest to archaeological conservation and pure and applied
sciences.(43)

ARCHAEOLOGICAL POLLEN ANALYSIS.

Archaeological pollen analysis takes two forms. The first, almost identical to standard paleoecol-
ogical palynology, uses long cores from lake sediments to reconstruct regional climates, vegetation
patterns, and people-environmental relations. The second is the hand-maiden of archaeology and
samples sediments from sites to understand small scale problems such as use areas or food processing.
Both methods have much to contribute to archaeology. This workshop will compare and contrast
these two methods to show how they can yield complimentary insights into the human past.(53)

ASPECTS OF MEANING IN EASTERN DAKOTA MORTUARY PRACTICES: AN
INVESTIGATION USING ETHNOHISTORIC AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA.

Archaeological and ethnohistoric evidence concerning Eastern Dakota mortuary practices is pre-
sented for the period A-D. 800 - 1862. Significant changes are noted in several aspects of practice
during the period of Euro-American contact, including an increasing use of material associations and
use of coffins. In contrast, a persistent pattern of post-mortem treatment is noted, characterized by
placement of the dead on aerial platforms with subsequent interment in earthen mounds. A symbolic
contrast of “interment” above-ground and below-ground is suggested and linked to a set of conceptual
principles manifested in contrasting notions of spirit/body and sky/earth.(60)}

ANALYSIS OF FAUNAL REMAINS FROM UPPER PALEOLITHIC SITES IN THE LEVANT.

This paper examines patterns of faunal exploitation in the Levant during the Upper Paleolithic
(>40,000 to ca. 20,000 B.P.). The methodological focus is on the construction of age profiles derived
from the crown height measurements of several prey species from a group of Levantine Upper
Paleolithic sites (including Hayonim, Kebara, and Ksar Akil). These are compared with age profiles
from earlier, Mousterian and later, Epipaleolithic levels in order to shed light on the nature and extent
of changes in adaptive strategies in the Levant during the Upper Pleistocene.(4)

Southern Africa is fortunate in having several professional ethnographies from the Kalahari, valuable

MOOSE HUNTERS OF THE BOREAL FOREST? A REEXAMINATION OF BOREAL FOREST

SUBSISTENCE PATTERNS.

Classical subsistence patterns for the boreal forest have focused on moose, and to some extent
caribou, as the large game animals that provided efficient sources of meat, skins, and other materials,
Moose hunting plays an important role in models of boreal forest social organization, and ethnoar-
chaeological studies have projected such models into the past. Ethnohistoric, ecological, paleoecol-
ogical, and faunal data all suggest that moose did not move into subarctic areas until the last few
hundred years, thus moose hunting is a relatively recent phenomenon. Data from sites on Alaska's
Kenai Peninsula suggest some alternative models for the organization of boreal forest hunters.(59}

were introduced and became increasingly important components in both the subsistence and ideology
of coastal Ecuador. The impact of expanding Andean states on cultural developments in these more

BEYOND THE SHADOW OF MONTE ALBAN: CLASSIC PERIOD AFFILIATIONS IN THE

Rather than retreating into purely localized concems following the territorial retrenchment of
Monte Alban during the Classic period, the southern isthmus of Tehuantepec and other coastal areas
of Oaxaca appear to have asserted interregional ties through a loosely structured cultural and economic
network encompassing what Lee Parsons designated the ‘peripheral Coastal Lowlands.” Using exca-
vation data from the isthmus as a base, this paper offers a preliminary consideration of the stylistic

its potential significance for assessing the importance of El Tajin in the political structure of pre-

IMPERIALISM IN THE PACIFIC LOWLANDS.

Mounting evidence depicts the early Zapotec state at Monte Alban as a conquest-bent economic
predator. Fired by a demand for non-local goods, this imperialism is currently thought to have been
confined mainly to surrounding highland regions. But there are suggestions that the Zapotec realm
extended to the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec where an exchange system that for centuries
supplied Oaxaca Vallcy elites with desired coastal lowland commodities may have been replaced by
, 138 Zhang, Z.
Monte Alban with a system of procurement founded upon political subjugation. Should proposed
investigations lend further support to this hypothesis, the Late Preclassic frontier of the Zapotec
empire will need to be redrawn considerably beyond its presently estimated bounds.(5)

that only one assemblage can be positively identified as Aurignacian and another as possibly gravettian
or ‘gravettoid’. Possible explanations for this scarcity as opposed to the richness of the known
occupation of central Portugal in solutrean and magdalenian times are discussed.(4)

“CASUAL” REPEAT PHOTOGRAPHY AND HOPI ARCHITECTURE.

Since the 1880s, one response of the Hopi Indians of Arizona to Anglo-American society has been
to change their built environment—including materials, styles, arrangement of roofed space, village

ceremonial site and historical monument. Photographs, maps, and a scale model provide a visual
record of architectural change in the First Mesa community, particularly Walpi. Between 1880 and

environmental context of known sites. Using ARC/INFO, a geographic information system, a series
of environmental variables are derived from source maps. Based on these variables, a stepwise logistic
