, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(1) Organizational Complexity in Late Classic Copan.

Copan has been studied over the past nine years by three independent projects that make Copan
one of the most intensively studied Maya sites in Mesoamerica. As a result, we have detailed data
dealing with questions of ranking and stratification, the size and configuration of Maya households,
the nature of urbanization, and the complex relationships among such variables as social structure,
resource utilization and population. For this reason, we find it is time for a major symposium on
Copan. The papers in this symposium, therefore, will present syntheses and new interpretations of
the household and social class.

(4) Regional Perspectives on the Pleistocene Prehistory of the Old World.

Both ecological and socio-political components of past adaptations can best be comprehended from
a regional perspective. Papers in this symposium will address issues significant to hominid adaptations
in various regions of the Old World (Australia, China, East Africa, Central-Eastern-Western Europe,
Near East} during the Pleistocene. The papers will update our current state of knowledge and evaluate
the suitability of the available data for answering socio-ecological questions. The two discussants,
who specialize in hunter-gatherers of the New World, will examine the Old World record from a New
World perspective.

(5) Pottery Studies in the Northeast: Analytic Techniques and Anthropological Considerations.

In many areas of the Northeast, pottery analysis is still in its nascent stage. Methodology and
anthropological reconstructions are both topics of debate. This symposium introduces current con-
sensus and controversies in Northeastern pottery studies by focusing on recent research of workers
in New York, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. Papers explore all aspects of ceramic study,
including methods of analysis and classification, materials science studies, and pottery as a tool in
cultural reconstruction, e.g., its utility in delineating cultural origins, distributions, chronologies,
form of socio-political organization, subsistence-settlement strategies, and presence of exchange
networks. Regional synthesis and local case studies are presented.

(6) Computer-Based Geographic Information Systems: A Tool of the Future for Solving Problems in
the Past.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques traditionally refer to the storage, manipulation,
and retrieval of geographic data by the computer. Recently, GIS has transcended the mere processing
and display of data; it has taken a role in problem solving through the analysis and interpretation of
geographical phenomena and process. This symposium illustrates the sophistication of GIS technology
and the wide variety of potential applications to archaeological information management and research.
These applications include (1) efficiency of data encoding, storage, and manipulation, (2) modeling
capabilities, (3) land use planning and management, (4) the potential for investigating methodological
problems and answering research questions.

(9) Moving Beyond Mere Methods: On the relationship of Quantitative Methods and Archaeological
Theory.

Although quantitative methods have seen widespread use in archaeological research for almost two
decades, there is little agreement within the discipline as to just what has been learned about the past
through their application. Much of this lack of consensus can be traced to the failure by archaeologists
to adequately consider the place of quantitative methods in archaeological research and then to
demonstrate this place convincingly to potential users. Thus, the emphasis on the use of quantitative
methods has been at the level of technique, and very little has been said about how method and
archaeological theory should be related. The theme of this session is an examination, then, of the
“proper” roles and relationships of archaeological theory and quantitative methods. Topics to be
discussed are the relationships of theory to variable selection and measurement, the reliability of
measurement, definition of problem and choice of technique, and the integration of method and
theory into a practical epistemology of archaeological research. Suggestions for the more successful
use of quantitative procedures are offered to non-specialists.

(10) Transformation of the Domestic Economy with Inka Conquest of the Mantaro Valley.

Symposium reports recent results of the Upper Mantaro Archaeological Research Project |\UMARP)
which has been studying change and stability in the domestic economy from Wanka II (A.D. 1250-
1460}, when the region was fragmented into warring chiefdoms, to Wanka III (A.D. 1460-1532), when

the region was conquered by the Inka empire. We outline the indigenous Wanka II production system,
exchange networks, and consumption patterns, and discuss how the local economy responded to
regional peace, increased social stratification, and state tribute demands in Wanka IIL Contmbeted

papers study subsistence goods (plants and animals), craft goods (ceramics and stone tools) and wealth
(metal and shell).

(12) Prospects and Problems of Statistical Methods and Interpretation in Paleoethnobotany.

This symposium’'s objective is to promote new discussion of the methods that paleoethnobotanists
use to obtain the quality of archaeo-botanical data they need to address anthropological questions.
These papers state and explore the assumptions underlying the methods used to collect and analyze
archaeobotanical data, and assess how these methods and assumptions color paleoethnobotanical
interpretations. While the papers present data and interpretations, they emphasize how one gathers
and uses archaeobotanical data to answer research questions. The symposium covers all stages of
paleoethnobotanical research, from designing a sampling strategy to quantification and interpretation.
(14) History and State of the Art of American Archaeology.

The 50th Anniversary of the Society for American Archacology is a milestone in the history of
American archaeology, tor the Society was founded at a time when American archaeology was taking
its first halting steps as a professional science, and over the years—through its journal and annual
meetings—it has served as the major forum for the exchange and development of archaeological
knowledge. In recognition of this auspicious occasion, the Society is sponsoring this session on the
History and State of the Art in American Archaeology, to assess its past, and look to its future.

(15) Archaeological Survey in Europe: Achievements and Perspectives,

In comparison with the large-scale regional surveys in the Americas and Mesopotamia, archaeolog-
ical survey in Europe has matured more slowly, but nonetheless distinctively. A variety of surveys
over the last 20 years has addressed several “Big Questions”’ of culture process, e.g. the origins of tood
production, socio-cultural differen,tiation of later farmers, and the development of urbanization. In
this symposium, the achievements of regional survey in Europe are presented in the context of current
culture-historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives.

(16) Cross-Media: Technological and Social Approaches Toward a General Theory of Artifact Style.

Two previously separate frameworks for explaining morphologicaldesign variation among artifacts
are wedded: technological studies of artifact manufacture, function, and maintenance; and socio-
stylistic studies. Potential parallelism among five hierarchies are investigated to achieve integration:
the sequence of manufacturing steps; the logical sequence of decisions about alternative options over
all steps; the levels of visibility of attributes; the ranges of geographic extent of attributes; and the
hierarchy of meanings of attributes. Complementary boundary conditions for the social interaction
theory and information exchange theory of style—previously seen as incompatible—are set. Progress
is made in developing rules for assigning meaning to attributes. Many media are examined.

(17) Evolutionary Approaches to the Study of Human Diversity.

Anthropologists are concerned with the explanation of human cultural variability over time and
$pace. However, notions of cultural evolution are fraught with tremendous misunderstanding and
continuing controversy. Many argue that scientific evolution remains an untried theory in explana-
tions of human phenomena. This symposium addresses some fundamental theoretical and empirical
issues that are largely unresolved: (1) To what extent is human cultural variability explicable in
Darwinian versus Lamarckian terms? (2) What role does populationist thinking play? 3) What epis-
temological and methodological barriers exist in evolutionary approaches to understanding human
diversity?

(18) Assessing the Impact of Federal Archaeology.

During the last decade American archaeology has experienced explosive growth. This growth is a
direct result of federal and nonfederal efforts to satisfy federal environmental and historic preservation
requirements. Much of the work undertaken in this vein has been criticized as atheoretical and/or
for failing to make substantive contributions commensurate with the level of effort and funding. The
papers in this symposium examine the evolution of substantive and theoretical archaeological knowl-
edge in various regions of the U.S. and identify contributions directly attributable to federal archae-
ology. The papers serve as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the criticism, the real value of federal
archaeology, and problem areas in need of additional work.

(19) Ethnobotany: New Perspectives on Old Problems.

Typically, archaeobotanical investigations are of such limited scope and offer such tentative con-
clusions as to be of only peripheral interest to archaeologists. Nevertheless, in attempting to relate
man to his environment, archaeologists greatly desire information about issues such as domesticated
plant origins and dispersal, subsistence and technological strategies and the reconstruction of prehis-
toric vegetation. Recent theoretical and methodological advances in ethnobotany, new data that

4
, (26) Issues in Archaeological Surface Survey 45

changes our perspective on supposedly well-known societies, and new techniques for data extraction

from the archaeological record, promise insights into old and often unresolved problems. Research
carned out by practicing ethnobotanical archaeologists in North America (Plains, Midwest, South-
west, Meso-america) illustrates the progress made toward resolution of these problems,

(20) Cultural Adjustments in Mesoamerica During and After the Decline of Teotihuacan.

Teotihuacan’s decline and demise initiated a new era in Mesoamerica, sometimes called the PostClassic
stage, which endured until the arrival of the Spaniards. This symposium examines the cultural events
and processes which accompanied this restructuring of Mesoamerican societies in several key areas,
including Central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, and the Maya zone, The papers include discussions of
political processes, economic patterns, militarism, and elite interaction in both symbolic and mun-
dane spheres. Archaeological, art historical, and ethnohistorical perspectives and data bases provide

a multi-disciplinary vantage point on the phenomena under consideration.

(21) Maya Archaeology in the Eastern Periphery of the Central Lowlands from Preclassic to Spanish

Colonial Times.

The first part of this symposium begins with an overview of the prehistoric settlement chronology
and land use in the Belize Valley and will follow with specific discussions of the Late Classic,
Postclassic and Historic occupation in the area. Broadening to all of Belize, the second part will focus
on aspects of construction, lithic technology, and ceramic manufacture in the Postclassic and Historic
periods; correlation of archaeology and ethnohistory in field research; and the interpretation of skeletal
data from cemeteries. The Symposium provides an overview of current research in the Upper Belize
Valley in particular and the Postclassic-Spanish Colonial periods in Belize as a whole,

(22) Some Developments in Canadian Archaeology.

The main thrust of the Symposium is to highlight some of the more significant recent developments
in Canadian archaeology which are likely to be of interest to a general audience. It is also hoped that
the presentations will help to alleviate the regrettable tendency for political boundaries to inhibit the
exchange of archaeological information.

(23) Stylistic Patterning in Regional Systems of Interaction.

Stylistic patterning on a regional scale provides a means for investigating how prehistoric popula-
tions in different areas interacted with one another, Methodological problems which confront the
archaeologists include the documentation of the degree of stylistic variation in different media across
space, the identification of boundaries, and monitoring changes in the observed patterns, More general
theoretical problems involve the relationships between stylistic variation on a regional scale and
other demographic, economic, and sociopolitical and ideological variables. These issues are explored
for different parts of North America which were characterized by varying degrees of organizational

complexity.
(24) Shell Midden Site Analysis.

Shell Middens are a special type of site that require specialized techniques for excavation, analysis
of stratigraphy, and content. The intent of this Symposium is to provide an opportunity for exchange
of information on these issues by participants working on both coasts of North American. The
emphasis in all papers is on methodology as opposed to site specific cultural reconstruction. Specific
topics include: excavation and recording, remote sensing and evaluation of site volume, site formation
Processes, faunal analysis, seasonality, chronology, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction.

(25) Society for American Archaeology Regional Conferences.

Results of the SAA-sponsored Regional Conferences will be presented by the chairs of the respective
conferences. Each will consider the status of the regional data base; standards and guidelines for the
conduct of cultural resource management in a regional context; and interactions of regional planning
with state and federal regulations and the State Plan process.

(26) Issues in Archaeological Surface Survey: Meshing Theory and Method.

Entrenched CRM methodologies are inconsistent with the disposition of archaeological remains

and must be re-evaluated in light of the tollowing questions. (1) What do we want to know about past
human adaptations and what can we know about them, given the nature of the archaeological record?
(2) What sorts of data and data collection methods are consistent with the above? (3! Whar linking
arguments must be made and verified to tie these two areas together? Contnbutions wil! feces ox
the nature of past human systems, the cultural and natural transformation processes respomsible for
the archaeological record, and contemporary methods of discovery and analysis.
, 46 (27) The Behavioral Implications of Ceramics
(27) The Behavioral Implications of Ceramics.

Traditional approaches to ceramic analyses have not emphasized behavioral components often
inherent within assemblage data. Thus, little is understood of the formation processes that link
ceramic production and usage with their material residues. This symposium addresses those consid-
erations, employing both archaeological and ethnoarchacological perspectives. Emphasis is given to
those activities that create the ceramic record, and the means by which such data may be interpreted.
(31) Early Man in South America.

Results of recent excavations at the Monte Verde wet site in Chile, the Arroyo Seco Cemetery on
the Argentine pampas, which also contains extinct megamammals, and several sites in northeastern
Brazil will be presented. Available evidence indicates that unifacial flake and pebble tools compose
the archaeologically visible material culture of early South Americans from some time before 30,000
BP. The unifacial stone industry persists into ceramic times in northeastern Brazil. In several other
parts of the continent, bifacial tools appear between about 14,000 and 11,000 BP, At Monte Verde,
wood was a much more important material than flaked stone to villagers 13,000 years ago.

(37) Getting Food Without Farming: Actualistic Habitat Studies That Inform Archaeology.

Archacologists have recently begun to study detailed attributes of the distribution and quality of
food resources available in selected modern habitats as a guide to modeling the problems and oppor-
tunities that would have faced prehistoric foragers. Symposium participants will discuss current
studies of habitats in North America and sub-Saharan Africa that document the nutritional and
harvesting constraints, the seasonal availability, and the habitat distributions of plant and animal
foods. Focus will be on how such information can be analyzed to model aspects of prehistoric
subsistence strategies that relate directly to the archaeological record,

(38) Archaic Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology in the Northern Southwest.

Interests in hunter-gatherer archacology, and the recent surge in cultural resource management
work, has focused attention on the Archaic period in the American Southwest. However, there have
been few attempts to present a regional perspective of current Archaic research interests, or some
form of regional research design. This symposium addresses this problem by offering a forum in which
a series of papers can be introduced. Discussions will illustrate the current avenues of research which
are being undertaken for the Archaic of the northern Southwest, and offer suggestions for future
directions in problem oriented research.

(39) Demography of the Maya Lowlands.

Some of the profound changes in lowland Maya archacology in recent decades have been in the
realm of demography. Under the impact of rapidly accumulating data, the view of the Maya has been
transformed from the image of very low population density to one of a surprisingly high density for
the environment. This symposium will deal with demographic issues ranging from new data from
ongoing projects (Sayil and Nohmul} and synthesis of older projects (Tikal and the Central Peten

« Lakes) to synthetic treatments of disjunctive growth, and regu-larity in site spacing.
(41) Advances in Computer Techniques.

The papers address a variety of current applications and issues ranging from microprocessors to the
design of a data structure for a large Federal database. Several discussions focus on the increased
availability of microcomputers and their use im a variety of environments. Descriptions of software
include database management, graphics and plotting usage, and site register systems. Problems ranging
from PC-mainframe interface, security, and lega) concerns, are identified. Several applications address
new computer techniques in field situations, including portable data recorders, instrument interface,
bar code readers, digital devices, and database management.

(42) Economic Prehistory of the Central Andes.

During the past few years important advances have been made in the study of zooarchaeological
and palaeobotanical materials from Central Andean archaeological sites. These studies provide detailed
information on the prehistoric subsistence adaptation at each site, and together serve as a basis for
documenting the process of economic development from early hunting and/or gathering through
intensive agricultural production at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although much research
remains to be completed, this symposium will provide a review of palaeobiological data from archae-
ological sites spanning the entire prehistoric sequence in each of the three principal eco-systems of
the central Andes (puna, highland valley, coast); and examine the patterns of economic development
both within and between these zones during the prehistoric period.

(43) The Organization of Classic Period Hohokam Society.

The Period A.D. 1100 to 1450 was a time of drastic change and reorganization throughout the

American Southwest. This symposium examines this period with an emphasis on the changing
, (51) Archaeology About People 47
character of the manner in which the socio-political, economic, subsistence, and settlement patterns
were organized. The concepts offered here include a combination of substantive, methodological, and
theoretical perspectives whose application goes beyond the Classic Period Hohokam. Thus, in addition
to providing a sample of recent Classic Period research, general theoretical goals and suggestions for
new resarch directions are presented that also may be applicable to other Southwestern areas.

(44) Explaining Anasazi Cultural Change in the Dolores Valley, A.D. 600-980.

The Dolores Archaeological Program is a CRM project in southwestern Colorado. Most of the
cultural resources within the project area are derived from A.D. 600-980 Anasazi occupations and
provide evidence for extreme population fluctuations, population aggregation and village develop-
ment, and agricultural intensification. A general model of culture change, based in part on least-cost
principles, was adopted as an explanatory structure to generate and integrate problem-oriented and
synthetic studies. Foci of the model are the resource supply and population in shaping the directions
of cultural change during this time period. Expectations for agricultural intensification, storage
behavior, tool kit composition, exchange and social organization are derived from the model and are
tested against the archaeological record, The success of the model as an explanatory framework is
assessed, and alternative models are discussed.

(45) Late Prehistoric Adaptational Strategies on the Southern Plains.

The variability of the Plains climate is often cited as an important factor in influencing human
adaptation to the region. However, little detailed research has actually been conducted on that topic
until relatively recently, This symposium surveys recent research on Late Prehistoric adaptive strat-
egies on the southern Plains from two perspectives, One approach is concerned with the structure
and role of external economies. The other addresses internal socioeconomic structure and its spatial
manifestations. Together these two perspectives expand the understanding of southern Plains life-
styles prior to historic documentation.

(47) Beyond Ethnoarchaeology: Adaptive Strategies of Foragers-Collectors from the Archaeological
Record.

Archaeologists are beginning to apply results of ethnoarchaeological research to infer the adaptive
strategies of prehistoric forager-collectors. Some have focused on lithics while others concentrate on
faunal assemblages, and symposia have been directed at one or another data category. While productive
for individual specialists, these symposia have not engendered an exchange of ideas among scholars
with different foci and methods; metalanguages remain distinct. This symposium assembles scholars
from various parts of the world to (1) create an environment for communication between specialists;
(2) assemble alternative methods archaeologists can apply to data of varying quality and completeness;
and (3) initiate development of concepts to enhance communication among students of forager-
collector archaeology.

(48) House and Household Production in Andean America.

This symposium marshals recent archaeological data relating to residential architecture and domes-
tic economy on a comparative pan-Andean scale. Utilizing the concept of household as a basic
analytical unit and unifying theme, its purpose is to examine the relation between domestic produc-
tion and its larger socio-economic or political context in a diachronic perspective extending from the
Preceramic to Post-Conquest times. Papers focus on the definition of residential contexts as house-
holds or domestic groups and evidence for household participation in the overall social process of
production. Thus, the household acts as an analytical device for ordering social and economic data in
Andean prehistory.

(50) The Case for Full-Coverage Regional Survey.

There are many expositions on the methods and benefits of sampling survey, but few arguments
for near-100% regional coverage. Those who have attempted full coverage see significant practical
and interpretive advantages in that method. Unfortunately, many research and CRM projects presup-
pose sampling without considered justification. Symposium participants with full-coverage experi-
ence in the U.S, Southwest, Mesoamerica, Peru, and Iran will discuss what results could not have
been obtained without full coverage, and how such results are related to the ability to address broader
anthropological issues. The conclusions may lead to more careful, less automatic, formulation of
regional research designs.

(51) Archaeology About People: Broadening the Perspective.

In spite of avowed efforts to be more anthropological, and in spite of many recent excursions mn
ethnoarchaeology, much current archaeological work reflects a disinclination to move fromm material
remains and patterns to the people and societies who were agents in their genesis. if the mowe &

made, it is usually to a restricted set of domains, those related to “economic’’ behavior. This sym-
posium explores the reasons for this customary narrow perspective and its implications. Theoretical
and methodological avenues for broadening the perspective are offered, with case studies which
illustrate the results of their applications,

(52) 10,001 B.P.: The End of the Paleolithic in the Old World.

To what extent and how did the environment changes ca., 10,000 B.P. affect human adaptations in
the Old World? This symposium will address the nature of the terminal Paleolithic/early Mesolithic
record in specific regions of Europe, Africa, and Asia at the traditional Pleisto,cene/Holocene boundary.
It will deal with evidence of changes in technology, subsistence, settlement patterns, and spatial
organization at this time and explore the indications, if any, that these changes may relate to envi-
ronmental changes. The symposium will evaluate evidence for continuity versus rupture in regional
adaptations at the end of the Last Glacial and will discuss the relative importance of environmental
change versus other possible causal factors such as population pressure. it will also explore the
relevance of the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary per se to culture change, as opposed to the effects of
the long overall warming trend spanning the Tardi-glacial. Emphasis will be on composition of the
environmental and cultural records from specific well-documented regions.

(53) Settlement Plans: The Spatial Organization of Small Communities.

The configuration of domestic and public structures and spaces within a settlement reflects many
behavioral patterns of the resident community. Correlation of these behavioral patterns with specific
aspects of archaeological settlement plans currently is unclear. This symposium examines settlement
plan/behavior relationships using smal] settlements as examples. Papers discuss relationships between
settlement plans and subsistence activities, exchange, social differentiation and interaction, cultural
perceptions of space, and plan standardization and modification. World-wide examples include the
southwestern, southeastern, and midwestern U.S., Micronesia, New Guinea, and South Africa.

(54) Ancient Settlements of the Colha Area, Northern Belize.

The continuing program of fieldwork at the Maya site of Colha, Belize, and at nearby Kichpanha,
provide new perspectives on the activities within Maya settlements at these sites. Excavations at
Colha in 1983 focused on Preclassic, Late Classic, and Early Post-classic locales. At Kichpanha, a
Middle Preclassic house mound was excavated and Late Classic mound groups were tested. In 1985,
Middle Preclassic habitations were investigated, expanding on the data obtained in 1983. This sym-
posium addresses research problems related to each of the settlements.

(57) Beyond Tool Use; The Contributions of Microwear Analysis to Archaeology and Prehistory.

Most recent literature on microwear analysis has been concerned with technical discussions of
method and technique or the simple reportage of results. This symposium is devoted to papers
employing-the results of high-magnification microwear analysis in addressing questions of general
archaeological interest. The questions addressed include such general concerns as site function,
prehistoric social organization, cultural or stylistic variability, lithic ‘economy’, etc, The prehistoric
artifacts analyzed in these papers cover a wide range of areas and periods; PaleoIndian and Mississip-
pian from the U.S., the Neolithic and Upper Paleolithic of western Europe, and the Old World Lower
Paleolithic.

(58) Digging for Dollars and Making Sense: Scholarship Beyond Academe.

In contrast to the scholars” of academe, contract archaeologists have been labeled shovel bums’
and their writings have been characterized as a grey literature that seldom makes connection with
the larger body of thought that constitutes our profession's intellectual wealth and heritage. The first
paper explores why, justifiably, or otherwise, the onerous reputation has arisen. The next seven papers
are a forum for contract archaeologists working in central and southern Arizona to demonstrate their
scholarly participation in the marketplace of ideas. A critical paper out of academe evaluates the
scholarship of the Arizona cases. A summarist, with personal experience on both sides of the fence,
concludes with further rebuttal and evaluation.

(59) Evolution of Subsistence, Settlement, and Exchange on the Northern Channel Islands of Califor-
nia.

Recent research carried out on the four northern Channel Islands has substantially increased
knowledge of subsistence, settlement, and economic exchange systems over the course of the last
7000 years of prehistory, Systematic surveys have documented extensive occupation on all four of
the islands, and analyses of midden constituents have elucidated the development of marine resource
procurement systems, craft specialization, and regional exchange systems. Some of the papers in the
symposium concern one or more of these topics, while others concern the use of ethnohistoric data
to understand the archaeological record.

Pollen, Macrofossil, and Charcoal Analysis of Basketmaker Coprolites from Turkey Pen Ruin, Utah.

Located in southeastern Utah, Turkey Pen Ruin provides an excellent opportunity to study Anasazi
subsistence through well preserved remains. One of the most direct means of analyzing prehistoric
diet is to study the plant remains that feces contain. Twenty-eight human coprolites and two turkey
droppings were chosen for study. The pollen and macrofossil studies presented in this paper describe
what food plants the Basketmaker Anasazi ate, how they prepared these items, and at what time of
year the plants were gathered. {19)

Short-Term Ceramic Change During the Hohokam Sedentary/Classic Period Transition.

The ceramic chronology, as well as the changing structure of Hohokam society, is poorly understood
for the time between the late Sedentary and early Classic periods. But recent excavations at Las
Colinas, a village site in the Phoenix Basin, document an exceptionally welldated occupation that is
temporally placed to the Sedentary/Classic transition. The tight temporal control permits the analysis
of ceramic change with uncommon detail, informing about the evolving structure of Hohokam society
during a time of considerable change and, more generallly, about ceramic change in prehistoric
societies over the short term, (43)

Architecture, Labor and Social Class at Copan, Honduras.

Residential architecture is used as an index to measure social status differences at the Late Classic
Maya site of Copan, Honduras. Excavated residences representing the inferred range of socioeconomic
statuses are quantified in terms of energy costs, these total costs based on task-specific costs obtained
through replicative experiments. Energy differentials among structures are presented and interpreted
as being reflective of a tripartite labor recruitment system corresponding with the differential social
power associated with the commoner, lineage elite, and central elite sectors of Maya society. (1)

Adaptive Changes in Prehistoric Hunter-Gatherer use of Wild Plant Resources: Evidence from Hancat
Cave.

The relationship between archaic and hunter-gatherer adaptive strategies and environmental changes
in central Arizona remains poorly understood. This is especially true with respect to the use of wild
plant resources. Data from recent excavations in a dry cave provide information concerning long term
changes in the use of wild plant resources, while fossil packrat midden analyses provide controls on
paleoenvironmental fluctuations during this period (ca. 8500-1500 BP). The resulting patterns in these
plant assemblages are integrated with a regional model of hunter-gatherer adaptive changes in the
Gila River Basin. (47}

Ackerman, Robert E. (Washington State)
Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Archaeology of Southwestern Alaska with Implications for Eastern
Beringia.

The earliest archaeological tradition in Southwestern Alaska (Denali or Paleo-Arctic Tradition) can
be seen as an adaptation to the late Pleistocene/Early Holocene environment prior to the spread of
the Boreal Forest, Similar site complexes of this age range are noted for interior Alaska and the
southeastern coastal region. The relatively rapid spread of the Denali/Paleo-Arctic Tradition suggests
either movements of groups of people into a more productive environment or the diffusion of a
cultural complex through earlier established peoples. As this tradition appears to be the earliest yet
known in Alaska with evidence indicating that it is derived from an older but similar Diuktai complex
from Siberia, it can be hypothesized that older sites if found in Alaska will be simply older versions
of the same tradition. (35)

Sand Canyon Pueblo: A Thirteenth Century Anasazi Ceremonial Center in Southwestern Colorado.

Large scale social and ritual networks are increasingly being recognized in prehistoric cultures of
the North American Southwest. Such a network apparently developed in southwestern Colorado after
A.D. 1200, centered around no more than eight ritual and exchange centers, This paper examines the
first year’s excavation of and survey around one of these centers, Sand Canyon Pueblo, and evaluates
lines of evidence supportive of its interpretation as a ceremonial center. |40)

Style, Basketry, and Basketmakers: Another Look.

For more than a decade it has been suggested that of all classes of artifactual material available to
the archaeologist for analysis, none has more potentially diagnostic features than basketry. Indeed,
on the broadest or “culture area” level down to the level of the individual maker, no commonly
recovered prehistoric artifact form has more culturally standardized and still visible attributes than
basketry. The definition and identification of style in prehistoric basketry from the level of a linguistic

‘i “population” of weavers through an individual maker is reiterated, refined, and illustrated through
. case studies. (16)

On the Quantitative Structure of Archaeological Data.
The useful application of quantitative methods to archaeological problems has been hindered by
\ many factors, but one that has received little attention is the failure by archaeologists to fully
7 understand the structure of archaeological data, Structure as used here has two components: (1) the
interrelationship of variables, measurement, and measurement reliability. These aspects of structure
. combine to create a continuum of the complexity of distributional forms in multidimensional space;
n and (2) the interrelationship of distributional form, technique, and definition of problem. A concep-
" tualization of structure in this framework clearly integrates the empirical problem of reliable data
recovery and measurement with more theoretical issues of problem definition, variable selection, and
e method choice. The implications of this view of structure are examined, and practical applications
of the concept are offered. (9)

‘ Federal Archaeology in the Northern Plains: 1945-1985.
‘ On the northern Plains, particularly in the Dakotas, from 1945 to the early 1970s, archaeology was
‘ dominated by site inventories and site excavations of the River Basin Surveys (RBS). Since the mid-
; 1970s abroad range of physiographic and topographic areas have been surveyed through contract
archaeology. Thousands of sites have been recorded. The goal of these surveys, however, has shifted
E « from excavation to preservation. As only a limited amount of information can be gleaned from surface
survey and test excavations, contract archaeology has advanced our understanding of northern Plains
prehistory only slightly since the days of the RBS. (18)

A reexamination of dendrochronological evidence, combined with a seriation of single component
sites, reveals that temporal spans of Kayenta ceramic styles (types) are shorter than formerly assumed
and that the relative type frequencies at any given point in time can be delineated quite closely. This
allows more precise control for chronologically based studies, and provides the basis for looking at
old problems in new ways. The potential for demographic studies and the examination of the cyclic

‘ aspects of culture change are briefly explored. (11)

Dietary Reconstruction in Eastern and Southern Africa Based on Bone Collagen, Stable Carbon, and
Nitrogen Isotope Ratios.

Stable carbon isotope ratios alone are insufficient to differentiate between many dietary adaptations
in tropical environments. Combined carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis of bone collagen can be
used to differentiate between high and low protein diets, tropical grain and non-grain plant staple
diets, grazer- and browser-based pastoral or hunter diets, high and low legume plant diets, and marine
and terrestrial diets. We present the results and implications of the analysis of 140 historic and
prehistoric human bone samples from Eastern and Southern Africa, representing populations with
hunter-gatherer, pastoral, agricultural, lacustrine and marine-based diets. (56)

. Measuring Intensification.

Intensification is widely recognized as a significant process in changing hunter-gatherer production.

. However, despite intensification’s theoretical importance, it remains poorly understood and difficult
to apply to the archaeological records of hunter-gatherers. The development of a model of hunter-

gatherer intensification with testable material correlates is an important step. The model presented
| in this paper is tested against a well known example of intensification; maize in the Tehuacan Valley,

and a poorly known example: salmon on the Pacific coast of North America. (49)

Linguistic Implications for ARchaeological Study of the Hohokam Regional System.

Linguistic and archaeological data indicate that for two or more centuries near A.D. 1000, certain
Yuman groups lived in close association with speakers of Upper Piman, a language unrelated to
Yuman languages. Correlation of archaeological, ethnographic, and linguistic information leads to
the inference that Yuman-Piman bilingualism developed in the western portion of the Hohokam

culture area of southern Arizona. Comparison of Yuman and Hohokam burial practices strongly
supports the linguistic analysis. The study explores the implications for Hohokam cultural develop-
| ment within the framework of the recently proposed Hohokam Regional System concept. (3)

Disposition of Human Remains on Navajo Lands: Proposed Procedures.

Recent key Federal and Tribal legislation has often proved inadequate for dealing with human
remains. Because of this the Navajo Nation Division of Resources has developed a working set of
procedures for cultural resource managers and developers to follow in the identification, verification,
and ultimate disposition of human remains on Navajo land. These procedures attempt to address
legal and human concerns of next-of-kin, local residents, and the Tribe as a whole. This paper presents
these procedures along with suggestions for their modification for use elsewhere. (30)

A Prehistoric Net From Sheep Mountain, Wyoming: Analysis, Comparions, and Implications.

A nearly complete example of a 6th millennium B.C. fishnet knot big game hunting net recovered
from a rockshelter on Sheep Mountain, Wyoming, represents the earliest of its kind ever recovered
from outside the Great Basin. It is one of the very few prehistoric large game procurement nets ever
recovered from anywhere in North America. The net is described in terms of process and product,
and it is extensively compared to others recovered from both inside and outside the Great Basin. The
implications of the existence of such nets are also discussed in terms of Archaic subsistence strategies.

The Origins and Evolution of Lithic Craft Specialization on the Channel Islands, California.

Recent field investigations on Santa Cruz Island reveal a chert microblade production industry of

an intensity unparalleled in North America. Several island coastal sites bear densities of microblades
and cores from which they were manufactured in numbers exceeding thousands per cubic meter, The
origins and evolution of this industry are traced using excavation and survey data from these sites
and several others, including a dozen major quarries. It is demonstrated that the manufacturing
activities at certain of these sites represent true craft specialization. A definition of specialization and
several methods useful in identifying genuine lithic specialization are advanced. (59)

The Impact of Federal Archaeology in Alaska.

Federal archaeology in Alaska can be divided into two periods: Pre- and Post-pipeline. Before the
oil pipeline was built, federal involvement was limited largely to funding scholarly research. Since
pipeline construction, however, both agency archaeology and federal contract archaeology have grown
enormously, so that now almost all large and many small projects are carried out in response to federal
mandates and are supported by government funding. This paper examines the organizational and
substantive changes that have resulted and attempts to evaluate the contributions and shortcomings
of federal archaeology in Alaska. (18)

Paleoethnobotany of the Aztalan and Fred Edwards Sites: Late Woodland-Middle Mississippian Inter-
action in Southern Wisconsin.

Contact between Middle Mississippian populations from Illinois and the local Late Woodland

cultures can be clearly seen in two sites in southern Wisconsin. Paleoethnobotanical studies were
undertaken of the previously unanalysed material recovered from the 1967 excavations at the site of
Aztalan in eastern Wisconsin, and the 1984 excavations at the Fred Edwards site in extreme south-
western Wisconsin. Analysis of the material, which includes abundant tropical cultigens and a variety
. of nuts and seeds, provides a new perspective on the subsistence pattems resulting from scuh cultural
, interaction between disparate groups. {19}

Archaeological Plant Remains: Applications to Stratigraphic Analysis.

Typically, the archaeological botanist has depended on the field archaeologist for structural infor-

mation about a site so that a botanical assemblage can be partitioned into culturally meaningful
- subsets. However, carbonized plant remains have potential uses for delineating site structure, includ-
a ing applications to stratigraphic analysis. This paper explores some of the potential stratigraphic

contributions and the assumptions that underlie use of plant remains for this purpose. Case studies

are presented from research conducted at prehistoric sites in Illinois. (53)

Toward a Reconstruction of Magdalenian Behavior of Hunters: The Settlement of Verberie in the

Paris Basin.

Research at the Magdalenian open air site of Verberie places emphasis on the integration of different
research approaches: flint and stone conjoining, experimentation, microwear analysis, faunal and
spatial analysis, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The Verberie living floor, organized into
activity and refuse areas around hearths, shows activity patterns related to reindeer hunting and game
processing. The presence of all stages of flint knapping and tool making at the site permit a reappraisal
of the ‘‘tool-kit”’ hypothesis. (4)

Architectural Variability in the Hohokam Classic Period.

The use of space is extremely variable during the Hohokam Classic period. Some Hohokam folk
lived in compounds, others lived in pithouses, while still others lived in above-ground surface struc-
tures. Evidence from the Rowley Site suggests that this variability can be understood as the differential
response to different groups of Hohokam folk. The Rowley site and other sites are examined in an
effort to understand the nature of the differences between these groups and to understand the archi-
tectural forms that occur during the Hohokam Classic period. (43)

Last Glacial Settlement Systems in Northwest Greece.

Investigations of Paleolithic settlement systems usually impose a tension between the analysis of
faunal and artifactual sequences from highly localized and not necessarily representative “sites’’ and
models postulating dispersal of subsistence activities on a regional scale. This paper outlines some of
the methods and hypotheses being developed to address this problem in current fieldwork, and focuses
on four specific problem areas: (1) intra-site variation; (2) rationale of site location in a local paleoen-
vironmental setting, (3) inter-site variation on a regional scale; (4) long-term changes. (4)

predicted plant and animal resource availability and prehistoric settlement patterns. Preliminary
modeling and testing results will be given. |6)

Stars and War at Cacaxtla.

The Cacaxtla murals are often described as a synthesis of Maya-Teotihuacan style and elements.
This paper focuses on one Teotihuacan derived element—a star shape—with limited use at Cacaxtla.
At Teotihuacan this element is found most often in two contexts: aquatic and militaristic The latter
is consistent with its use at Cacaxtla and suggests continuity of meaning. It further suggests that
some of the glyphic elements at Cacaxtla are concise visual statements which derive their appearance
and meaning from more complete and complex mural and ceramic scenes at Teotihuacan. (20)

Southern High Plains-Southwestern Interaction: Late Evidence From the Conchas Reservoir Vicinity,
San Miguel County, New Mexico.

A recent reconnaissance of acreage surrounding Conchas Reservoir, located in the eastern pornon
of San Miguel County, New Mexico, at the confluence of the Canadian and Conchas Rivers, indicates
the existence of an interaction network between aborigional inhabitants of the Southern High Plains
and the Southwest. The evidence recorded includes both lithic and ceramic artifacts. The lithic
assemblage consists of projectile point styles and raw material sources, such as Alibates chert and
obsidian, attributable to both geographic areas. Brownware and greyware ceramics attributable to the
southwest were also recovered. (45)

Megalithic Tomb Architecture and Ritual: An Americanist View.

Central Place Theory, Archaeoastronomy, transhumant cattle herders, egalitarian farmers, kings,
Mediterranean teams of priests or architects etc., fail to explain the evolution of Continental Northern
European megalithic tombs. Analysis of 4000 tombs suggest that these ‘‘shrines”’ lined (paved?) trade
routes which link major population centers. Originally conceived as permanent mortuary structures,
these “public’’ monuments fostered ‘‘pilgrimages” and rituals designed to integrate very diverse
socioeconomic systems in a woodland environment. The architecture reflects strong spatial jsocial?;
divisions, limited access, rights of passage, etc. Local and regional interpretations of the “universal”
ritual complex as well as their temporal changes are evident in the architecture. (56)

Application of Heavy Minerals Analysis to Anasazi Ceramics in Grand Canyon.

The geologic technique of heavy mineral analysis is used to characterize prehistoric Anasazi ceram-
ics from two areas within Grand Canyon National Park. Three questions concerning the use of the
analytical technique are posed: (1) can heavy mineral analysis be used to identify similarities and
differences in the raw materials used in ceramic production, (2) is the technique sensitive enough to
recognize slight differences in raw material sources, (3) is the technique feasible when standard ceramic
analysis cannot adequately address the research questions? Analysis of Grand Canyon ceramics
indicates that the technique is feasible for a variety of research questions. (40)

Cutting Plants, Scraping Wood, and Killing Bison,

Tools from small bison kills at the Lubbock Lake Site, Lubbock County, Texas, show undoubted
microscopic traces of use on wood and plants, as well as in butchering. These diverse activities and
the abundance of tools used in them contrasts with the small, uniform assemblages recovered from
most bison kills. This contrast apparently results from the organizational differences between com-
muna! and non-communal hunting. The former is quite predictable and requires an essentially
constant and high degree of organization and preparation wherever it is practiced, The latter is much
less predictable and its practice more closely reflects local adaptations and environmental! conditions.

Color and Paste Compositional Relationships in Maya Ceramics: Palenque Mexico.

Covariation is sought between color and paste compositional groups derived from neutron activation
analysis. Munsell color data are analyzed for refired pottery having membership in the chemical
groups. The relationship of color (primarily reflecting iron concentration) to the multivariate elemen-
tal concentrations that characterize a chemical! group is considered in the context of production and
exchange in Palenque region ceramics. Wider methodological issues relate to the utility of paste color
in proveniance studies. (40)

‘Eafly State Formation in Italy: The Contribution of Archaeological Survey.

The archaeological investigations of the emergence of the Etruscan and allied states in Italy in the

« first millennium B.C. has traditionally concentrated on the major settlements and cemeteries and

their artifactual record. Hardly anything has been known of settlement trends at the regional scale,

or of relationships between population centers and their rural hinterlands, of the kind which are a

cornerstone of models of state formation in other parts of the world. This situation is finally being

rectified. The paper discusses the contribution of recent archaeological surveys in different parts of

the Italian peninsula to the study of early state formation, work which already points to far greater

regional complexity than hitherto supposed. {15)

Boundary Situations During the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene in the Levant.

Recent regional archaeological projects in the Mediterranean Levant which focused on questions
of chronology, technology, paleoecology, and site typology allow a delimitation of Upper Paleolithic
and early Neolithic cultures in the area. The reconstructed regional settlement and interaction
patterns permit a preliminary evaluation of cultural boundaries as well as an examination of changes
in boundaries from the Levantine Paleolithic to the early Neolithic. The paper will also examine the
relative importance of the observed changes (both climatic and cultural) for the establishment of early
farming communities. (4)

Late Prehsitoric Southern Plains Economies.

A number of recent studies have focued on Southern Plains/Southwest exchange. These in turn
have presented two contrasting models of this late prehistoric/protohistoric exchange system without
providing conclusive results. This paper will examine the internal structure of trade for the Edwards
and Garza complexes of the Southern Plains providing the spatial dimension for this study. Recent
obsidian hydration dates will provide the temporal framework. By this means, the nature of the
internal alliance structures and exchange processes can be evaluated against the two models of

A Technological Analysis of Flake Production at the Middle Paleolithic Site of Zobiste in Central

Recent excavations at the Middle Paleolithic open-air station of Zobiste in Northern Bosnia,
Yugoslavia, have yielded a well-documented assemblage comprising over 4000 pieces of chipped
stone. Two major aspects of this lithic industry, observed in collections from neighboring sites as
well, include the co-occurrence of laminar and radial flake preparation and the joint production of
naturally backed and Levallois flake blanks for use as tools. Interpretations for this technological
pattern are offered within the framework of a model of continuous lithic reduction based upon
quantitative measurements of core preparation. (40)

Late Classic Painted Ceramics as Indicators of Social Class.

Painted ceramics in caches and ritually appointed burials suggest that these objects relate to high
status or access to scarce resources. Other data, however, indicate all levels of Copanec society had
access to painted ceramics. A question is thus raised as to the social significance of these goods,
Variation in consumption patterns of various painted ceramic types in the Copan Valley suggest that
the ceramic groups functioned differently during the Late Classic. The correlation of ceramics and
social class is presented at a type-specific level but other cultural factors also are determining the use
of painted pottery. (1)

Pottery Diversity and Political Centralization.

The relationship between political/administrative centralization and craft production has been of
major interest to archaeologists recently. One general model has proposed that political centralization
correlates with increased administrative involvement in craft production, which leads to decreased
product diversity. This paper presents a case study which refutes the model. Archaeological evidence
from a historical, multi-component site in North Africa suggests that inceased political/administra-
tive involvement in the regional economy had minimal impact on local ceramic production. A
hierarchical diversity index, which measures both functional and morphological-compositional aspects
of ceramic variety, is used to detect the absence of change in pottery diversity. (1 1]

giving due weight to environmental potential, will focus on the socio-historical configuration within
which productive relations are embedded, and on the dialectical relation between ideology, power,
and material provisioning. Contemporary and prehistoric case studies will be used to illustrate the
argument. (49)

Studies of Mesoamerican writing systems have focused overwhelmingly on Maya hieroglyphs, with

writing in Central Mexico have not been carefully examined. Although the Central Mexican epi-
graphic system is best known from late pre-Conquest and early Colonial pictorial manuscripts,
fragmentary evidence in less perishable materials demonstrates that some basic principles of Central
Mexican writing were in use by Phase One of the Second Intermediate Period. Sites to be examined

Xochicalco’s stone monuments. These will be discussed as a major public statement of calendrical,
