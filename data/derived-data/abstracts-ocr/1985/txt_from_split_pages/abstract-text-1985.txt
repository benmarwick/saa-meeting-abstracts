, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(1) Organizational Complexity in Late Classic Copan.

Copan has been studied over the past nine years by three independent projects that make Copan
one of the most intensively studied Maya sites in Mesoamerica. As a result, we have detailed data
dealing with questions of ranking and stratification, the size and configuration of Maya households,
the nature of urbanization, and the complex relationships among such variables as social structure,
resource utilization and population. For this reason, we find it is time for a major symposium on
Copan. The papers in this symposium, therefore, will present syntheses and new interpretations of
the household and social class.

(4) Regional Perspectives on the Pleistocene Prehistory of the Old World.

Both ecological and socio-political components of past adaptations can best be comprehended from
a regional perspective. Papers in this symposium will address issues significant to hominid adaptations
in various regions of the Old World (Australia, China, East Africa, Central-Eastern-Western Europe,
Near East} during the Pleistocene. The papers will update our current state of knowledge and evaluate
the suitability of the available data for answering socio-ecological questions. The two discussants,
who specialize in hunter-gatherers of the New World, will examine the Old World record from a New
World perspective.

(5) Pottery Studies in the Northeast: Analytic Techniques and Anthropological Considerations.

In many areas of the Northeast, pottery analysis is still in its nascent stage. Methodology and
anthropological reconstructions are both topics of debate. This symposium introduces current con-
sensus and controversies in Northeastern pottery studies by focusing on recent research of workers
in New York, New England, and the Mid-Atlantic region. Papers explore all aspects of ceramic study,
including methods of analysis and classification, materials science studies, and pottery as a tool in
cultural reconstruction, e.g., its utility in delineating cultural origins, distributions, chronologies,
form of socio-political organization, subsistence-settlement strategies, and presence of exchange
networks. Regional synthesis and local case studies are presented.

(6) Computer-Based Geographic Information Systems: A Tool of the Future for Solving Problems in
the Past.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) techniques traditionally refer to the storage, manipulation,
and retrieval of geographic data by the computer. Recently, GIS has transcended the mere processing
and display of data; it has taken a role in problem solving through the analysis and interpretation of
geographical phenomena and process. This symposium illustrates the sophistication of GIS technology
and the wide variety of potential applications to archaeological information management and research.
These applications include (1) efficiency of data encoding, storage, and manipulation, (2) modeling
capabilities, (3) land use planning and management, (4 the potential for investigating methodological
problems and answering research questions.

(9) Moving Beyond Mere Methods: On the relationship of Quantitative Methods and Archaeological
Theory.

Although quantitative methods have seen widespread use in archaeological research for almost two
decades, there is little agreement within the discipline as to just what has been learned about the past
through their application. Much of this lack of consensus can be traced to the failure by archaeologists
to adequately consider the place of quantitative methods in archaeological research and then to
demonstrate this place convincingly to potential users. Thus, the emphasis on the use of quantitative
methods has been at the level of technique, and very little has been said about how method and
archaeological theory should be related. The theme of this session is an examination, then, of the
“proper” roles and relationships of archaeological theory and quantitative methods. Topics to be
discussed are the relationships of theory to variable selection and measurement, the reliability of
measurement, definition of problem and choice of technique, and the integration of method and
theory into a practical epistemology of archaeological research. Suggestions for the more successful
use of quantitative procedures are offered to non-specialists.

(10) Transformation of the Domestic Economy with Inka Conquest of the Mantaro Valley.

Symposium reports recent results of the Upper Mantaro Archaeological Research Project (|UMARP}
which has been studying change and stability in the domestic economy from Wanka Il (A.D. 1250-
1460), when the region was fragmented into warring chiefdoms, to Wanka III (A.D. 1460-1532), when

; the region was conquered by the Inka empire. We outline the indigenous Wanka II production system,
; exchange networks, and consumption patterns, and discuss how the local economy responded to
: regional peace, increased social stratification, and state tribute demands in Wanka I Contributed
j 43

i
, 44 {12) Prospects and Problems
papers study subsistence goods (plants and animals), craft goods (ceramics and stone tools) and wealth
(metal and shell).

(12) Prospects and Problems of Statistical Methods and Interpretation in Paleoethnobotany.

This symposium’s objective is to promote new discussion of the methods that paleoethnobotanists
use to obtain the quality of archaeo-botanical data they need to address anthropological questions.
These papers state and explore the assumptions underlying the methods used to collect and analyze
archaeobotanical data, and assess how these methods and assumptions color paleoethnobotanical
interpretations. While the papers present data and interpretations, they emphasize how one gathers
and uses archaeobotanical data to answer research questions. The symposium covers all stages of
paleoethnobotanical research, from designing a sampling strategy to quantification and interpretation.
(14) History and State of the Art of American Archaeology.

The 50th Anniversary of the Society for American Archacology is a milestone in the history of
American archaeology, for the Society was founded at a time when American archaeology was taking
its first halting steps as a professional science, and over the years—through its journal and annual
meetings—it has served as the major forum for the exchange and development of archaeological
knowledge. In recognition of this auspicious occasion, the Society is sponsoring this session on the
History and State of the Art in American Archaeology, to assess its past, and look to its future.

(15) Archaeological Survey in Europe: Achievements and Perspectives,

In comparison with the large-scale regional surveys in the Americas and Mesopotamia, archaeolog-
ical survey in Europe has matured more slowly, but nonetheless distinctively. A variety of surveys
over the last 20 years has addressed several "Big Questions” of culture process, e.g. the origins of food
production, socio-cultural differen,tiation of later farmers, and the development of urbanization. In
this symposium, the achievements of regional survey in Europe are presented in the context of current
culture-historical, theoretical, and methodological perspectives.

(16) Cross-Media: Technological and Social Approaches Toward a General Theory of Artifact Style.

Two previously separate frameworks for explaining morphologicaldesign variation among artifacts
are wedded: technological studies of artifact manufacture, function, and maintenance, and socio-
stylistic studies. Potential parallelism among five hierarchies are investigated to achieve integration:
the sequence of manufacturing steps; the logical sequence of decisions about alternative options over
all steps; the levels of visibility of attributes; the ranges of geographic extent of attributes; and the
hierarchy of meanings of attributes. Complementary boundary conditions for the social interaction
theory and information exchange theory of style—previously seen as incompatible—are set. Progress
is made in developing rules for assigning meaning to attributes. Many media are examined.

(17) Evolutionary Approaches to the Study of Human Diversity.

Anthropologists are concerned with the explanation of human cultural variability over time and
Space. However, notions of cultural evolution are fraught with tremendous misunderstanding and
continuing controversy. Many argue that scientific evolution remains an untried theory in explana-
tions of human phenomena. This symposium addresses some fundamental theoretical and empirical
issues that are largely unresolved: (1) To what extent is human cultural variability explicable in
Darwinian versus Lamarckian terms? (2) What role does populationist thinking play? (3) What epis-
temological and methodological barriers exist in evolutionary approaches to understanding human
diversity?

(18) Assessing the Impact of Federal Archaeology.

During the last decade American archaeology has experienced explosive growth. This growth is a
direct result of federal and nonfederal efforts to satisfy federal environmental and historic preservation
requirements. Much of the work undertaken in this vein has been criticized as atheoretical and/or
for failing to make substantive contributions commensurate with the level of effort and funding. The
papers in this symposium examine the evolution of substantive and theoretical archaeological knowl-
edge in various regions of the U.S. and identify contributions directly attributable to federal archae-
ology. The papers serve as the basis for assessing the accuracy of the criticism, the real value of federal
archaeology, and problem areas in need of additional work.

(19) Ethnobotany: New Perspectives on Old Problems.

Typically, archaeobotanical investigations are of such limited scope and offer such tentative con-
clusions as to be of only peripheral interest to archaeologists, Nevertheless, in attempting to relate
man to his environment, archaeologists greatly desire information about issues such as domesticated
plant origins and dispersal, subsistence and technological] strategies and the reconstruction of prehis-
toric vegetation. Recent theoretical and methodological advances in ethnobotany, new data that

changes our perspective on supposedly well-known societies, and new techniques for data extraction

from the archaeological record, Promise insights into old and often unresolved problems. Research
carried out by practicing ethnobotanical archaeologists in North America (Plains, Midwest, South-
west, Meso-america) illustrates the progress made toward resolution of these problems.

(20) Cultural Adjustments in Mesoamerica During and After the Decline of Teotihuacan.

Teotihuacan’s decline and demise initiated a new era in Mesoamerica, sometimes called the PostClassic
stage, which endured until the arrival of the Spaniards. This symposium examines the cultural events
and processes which accompanied this restructuring of Mesoamerican societies in several key areas,
including Central Mexico, the Gulf Coast, and the Maya zone. The papers include discussions of
political processes, economic patterns, militarism, and elite interaction in both symbolic and mun-
dane spheres. Archaeological, art historical, and ethnohistorical perspectives and data bases provide

a multi-disciplinary vantage point on the phenomena under consideration.

(21) Maya Archaeology in the Eastern Periphery of the Central Lowlands from Preclassic to Spanish

Colonial Times.

The first part of this symposium begins with an overview of the prehistoric settlement chronology
and land use in the Belize Valley and will follow with specific discussions of the Late Classic,
Postclassic and Historic Occupation in the area. Broadening to all of Belize, the second part will focus
on aspects of construction, lithic technology, and ceramic manufacture in the Postclassic and Historic
periods; correlation of archaeology and ethnohistory in feld research; and the interpretation of skeletal
data from cemeteries, The symposium provides an overview of current research in the Upper Belize
Valley in particular and the Postclassic-Spanish Colonial periods in Belize as a whale,

(22) Some Developments in Canadian Archaeology.

The main thrust of the symposium is to highlight some of the more significant recent developments
in Canadian archaeology which are likely to be of interest to a general audience, It is also hoped that
the presentations will help to alleviate the regrettable tendency for political boundaries to inhibit the
exchange of archaeological information.

(23) Stylistic Patterning in Regional Systems of Interaction.

Stylistic patterning on a regional scale provides a means for investigating how prehistoric popula-
tions in different areas interacted with one another, Methodological problems which confront the
archaeologists include the documentation of the degree of stylistic variation in different media across
space, the identification of boundaries, and monitoring changes in the observed patterns, More general
theoretical problems involve the relationships between stylistic variation on a regional scale and
other demographic, economic, and sociopolitical and ideological variables, These issues are explored
for different parts of North America which were characterized by varying degrees of organizational

complexity.
(24) Shell Midden Site Analysis.

Shell Middens are a special type of site that require specialized techniques for excavation, analysis
of stratigraphy, and content. The intent of this Symposium is to provide an opportunity for exchange
of information on these issues by participants working on both coasts of North American. The
emphasis in all papers is on methodology as opposed to site specific cultural reconstruction. Specific
topics include: excavation and recording, remote sensing and evaluation of site volume, site formation
Processes, faunal analysis, seasonality, chronology, and paleoenyironmental reconstruction.

(25) Society for American Archaeology Regional Conferences.

Results of the SAA-sponsored Regional Conferences will be presented by the chairs of the respective
conferences, Each will consider the status of the regional data base, standards and guidelines for the
conduct of cultural resource management in a regional context; and interactions of regional planning
with state and federal regulations and the State Plan process.

(26) Issues in Archaeological Surface Survey: Meshing Theory and Method.

Entrenched CRM methodologies are inconsistent with the disposition of archaeological remains

and must be re-evaluated in light of the following questions. (1) What do we want to know about past
human adaptations and what can we know about them, given the nature of the archaeological recogd?
(2) What sorts of data and data collection methods are consistent with the above? (3) Whar linking
arguments must be made and verified to tie these two areas together? Contributions will feces og
the nature of past human systems, the cultural and natural transformation Processes respomsible for
the archaeological record, and contemporary methods of discovery and analysis.
, 46 (27) The Behavioral Implications of Ceramics
(27) The Behavioral Implications of Ceramics.

Traditional approaches to ceramic analyses have not emphasized behavioral components often
inherent within assemblage data. Thus, little is understood of the formation processes that link
ceramic production and usage with their material residues. This symposium addresses those consid-
erations, employing both archaeological and ethnoarchaeological perspectives. Emphasis is given to
those activities that create the ceramic record, and the means by which such data may be interpreted.
(31) Early Man in South America.

Results of recent excavations at the Monte Verde wet site in Chile, the Arroyo Seco Cemetery on
the Argentine pampas, which also contains extinct megamammals, and several sites in northeastern
Brazil will be presented. Available evidence indicates that unifacial flake and pebble tools compose
the archaeologically visible material culture of early South Americans from some time before 30,000
BP. The unifacial stone industry persists into ceramic times in northeastern Brazil. In several other
parts of the continent, bifacial tools appear between about 14,000 and 11,000 BP, At Monte Verde,
wood was a much more important material than flaked stone to villagers 13,000 years ago.

(37) Getting Food Without Farming: Actualistic Habitat Studies That Inform Archaeology.

Archacologists have recently begun to study detailed attributes of the distribution and quality of
food resources available in selected modern habitats as a guide to modeling the problems and oppor-
tunities that would have faced prehistoric foragers. Symposium participants will discuss current
studies of habitats in North America and sub-Saharan Africa that document the nutritional and
harvesting constraints, the seasonal availability, and the habitat distributions of plant and animal
foods. Focus will be on how such information can be analyzed to model aspects of prehistoric
subsistence strategies that relate directly to the archaeological record.

(38) Archaic Hunter-Gatherer Archaeology in the Northern Southwest.

Interests in hunter-gatherer archaeology, and the recent surge in cultural resource management
work, has focused attention on the Archaic period in the American Southwest. However, there have
been few attempts to present a regional perspective of current Archaic research interests, or some
form of regional research design. This symposium addresses this problem by offering a forum in which
a series of papers can be introduced. Discussions will illustrate the current avenues of research which
are being undertaken for the Archaic of the northern Southwest, and offer suggestions for future
directions in problem oriented research.

(39) Demography of the Maya Lowlands.

Some of the profound changes in lowland Maya archaeology in recent decades have been in the
realm of demography. Under the impact of rapidly accumulating data, the view of the Maya has been
transformed from the image of very low population density to one of a surprisingly high density for
the tnvironment. This symposium will deal with demographic issues ranging from new data from
ongoing projects {Sayil and Nohmul} and synthesis of older projects (Tikal and the Central Peten

« Lakes) to synthetic treatments of disjunctive growth, and regu-larity in site spacing.
(41) Advances in Computer Techniques.

The papers address a variety of current applications and issues ranging from microprocessors to the
design of a data structure for a large Federal database. Several discussions focus on the increased
availability of microcomputers and their use in a variety of environments. Descriptions of software
include database management, graphics and plotting usage, and site register systems. Problems ranging
from PC-mainframe interface, security, and lega) concerns, are identified. Several applications address
new computer techniques in field situations, including portable data recorders, instrument interface,
bar code readers, digital devices, and database management.

(42) Economic Prehistory of the Central Andes.

During the past few years important advances have been made in the study of zooarchaeological
and palaeobotanical materials from Central Andean archaeological sites. These studies provide detailed
information on the prehistoric subsistence adaptation at each site, and together serve as a basis for
documenting the process of economic development from early hunting and/or gathering through
intensive agricultural production at the time of the Spanish conquest. Although much research
remains to be completed, this symposium will provide a review of palaeobiological data from archae-
ological sites spanning the entire prehistoric sequence in each of the three principal eco-systems of
the central Andes (puna, highland valley, coast); and examine the patterns of economic development
both within and between these zones during the prehistoric period.

(43) The Organization of Classic Period Hohokam Society.

The Period A.D. 1100 to 1450 was a time of drastic change and reorganization throughout the

American Southwest. This symposium examines this period with an emphasis on the changing
, (51) Archaeology About People 47
character of the manner in which the socio-political, economic, subsistence, and settlement patterns
were organized. The concepts offered here include a combination of substantive, methodological, and
theoretical perspectives whose application goes beyond the Classic Period Hohokam. Thus, in addition
to providing a sample of recent Classic Period research, general theoretical goals and suggestions for
new resarch directions are presented that also may be applicable to other Southwestem areas.

(44) Explaining Anasazi Cultural Change in the Dolores Valley, A.D. 600-980.

The Dolores Archaeological Program is a CRM project in southwestern Colorado, Most of the
cultural resources within the project area are derived from A.D. 600-980 Anasazi occupations and
provide evidence for extreme population fluctuations, population aggregation and village develop-
ment, and agricultural intensification. A general model of culture change, based in part on least-cost
principles, was adopted as an explanatory structure to generate and integrate problem-oriented and
synthetic studies. Foci of the model are the resource supply and population in shaping the directions
of cultural change during this time period. Expectations for agricultural intensification, storage
behavior, tool kit composition, exchange and social organization are derived from the model and are
tested against the archaeological record, The success of the model as an explanatory framework is
assessed, and alternative models are discussed.

(45) Late Prehistoric Adaptational Strategies on the Southern Plains.

The variability of the Plains climate is often cited as an important factor in influencing human
adaptation to the region. However, little detailed research has actually been conducted on that topic
until relatively recently. This symposium surveys recent research on Late Prehistoric adaptive strat-
egies on the southern Plains from two perspectives, One approach is concerned with the structure
and role of external economies. The other addresses internal socioeconomic structure and its spatial
manifestations. Together these two perspectives expand the understanding of southern Plains life-
styles prior to historic documentation.

(47) Beyond Ethnoarchaeology: Adaptive Strategies of Foragers-Collectors from the Archaeological
Record.

Archaeologists are beginning to apply results of ethnoarchaeological research to infer the adaptive
strategies of prehistoric forager-collectors. Some have focused on lithics while others concentrate on
faunal assemblages, and symposia have been directed at one or another data category. While productive
for individual specialists, these symposia have not engendered an exchange of ideas among scholars
with different foci and methods; metalanguages remain distinct. This symposium assembles scholars
from various parts of the world to (1) create an environment for communication between specialists;
(2) assemble alternative methods archaeologists can apply to data of varying quality and completeness;
and (3) initiate development of concepts to enhance communication among students of forager-
collector archaeology.

(48) House and Household Production in Andean America.

This symposium marshals recent archaeological data relating to residential architecture and domes-
tic economy on a comparative pan-Andean scale. Utilizing the concept of household as a basic
analytical unit and unifying theme, its purpose is to examine the relation between domestic produc-
tion and its larger socio-economic or political context in a diachronic perspective extending from the
Preceramic to Post-Conquest times. Papers focus on the definition of residential contexts as house-
holds or domestic groups and evidence for household participation in the overall social process of
production. Thus, the household acts as an analytical device for ordering social and economic data in
Andean prehistory.

(50) The Case for Full-Coverage Regional Survey.

There are many expositions on the methods and benefits of sampling survey, but few arguments
for near-100% regional coverage. Those who have attempted full coverage see significant practical
and interpretive advantages in that method. Unfortunately, many research and CRM projects presup-
pose sampling without considered justification. Symposium participants with full-coverage experi-
ence in the U.S, Southwest, Mesoamerica, Peru, and Iran will discuss what results could not have
been obtained without full coverage, and how such results are related to the ability to address broader
anthropological issues. The conclusions may lead to more careful, less automatic, formulation of
regional research designs.

(51) Archaeology About People: Broadening the Perspective.

In spite of avowed efforts to be more anthropological, and in spite of many recent excursions an
ethnoarchaeology, much current atchaeological work reflects a disinclination to move froen material
remains and patterns to the people and societies who were agents in their genesis. f the mowe =

posium explores the reasons for this customary narrow perspective and its implications. Theoretical
and methodological avenues for broadening the perspective are offered, with case studies which
illustrate the results of their applications.

(52) 10,001 B.P.: The End of the Paleolithic in the Old World.

To what extent and how did the environment changes ca., 10,000 B.P. affect human adaptations in
the Old World? This symposium will address the nature of the terminal Paleolithic/early Mesolithic
record in specific regions of Europe, Africa, and Asia at the traditional Pleisto,cene/Holocene boundary.
It will deal with evidence of changes in technology, subsistence, settlement patterns, and spatial
organization at this time and explore the indications, if any, that these changes may relate to envi-
ronmental changes. The symposium will evaluate evidence for continuity versus rupture in regional
adaptations at the end of the Last Glacial and will discuss the relative importance of environmental
change versus other possible causal factors such as population pressure. it will also explore the
relevance of the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary per se to culture change, as opposed to the effects of
the long overall warming trend spanning the Tardi-glacial. Emphasis will be on composition of the
environmental and cultural records from specific well-documented regions.

(53) Settlement Plans: The Spatial Organization of Small Communities.

The configuration of domestic and public structures and spaces within a settlement reflects many
behavioral patterns of the resident community. Correlation of these behavioral patterns with specific
aspects of archaeological settlement plans currently is unclear. This symposium examines settlement
plan/behavior relationships using small settlements as examples. Papers discuss relationships between
settlement plans and subsistence activities, exchange, social differentiation and interaction, cultural
perceptions of space, and plan standardization and modification. World-wide examples include the
southwestern, southeastern, and midwestern U.S., Micronesia, New Guinea, and South Africa.

(54) Ancient Settlements of the Colha Area, Northern Belize.

The continuing program of fieldwork at the Maya site of Colha, Belize, and at nearby Kichpanha,
provide new perspectives on the activities within Maya settlements at these sites. Excavations at
Colha in 1983 focused on Preclassic, Late Classic, and Early Post-classic locales. At Kichpanha, a
Middle Preclassic house mound was excavated and Late Classic mound groups were tested. In 1985,
Middle Preclassic habitations were investigated, expanding on the data obtained in 1983. This sym-
posium addresses research problems related to each of the settlements,

(57) Beyond Tool Use: The Contributions of Microwear Analysis to Archaeology and Prehistory.

Most recent literature on microwear analysis has been concerned with technical discussions of
method and technique or the simple reportage of results. This symposium is devoted to papers
employing-the results of high-magnification microwear analysis in addressing questions of general
archaeological interest. The questions addressed include such general concerns as site function,
prehistoric social organization, cultural or stylistic variability, lithic ‘economy’, etc, The prehistoric
artifacts analyzed in these papers cover a wide range of areas and periods; Paleolndian and Mississip-
pian from the U.S., the Neolithic and Upper Paleolithic of western Europe, and the Old World Lower
Paleolithic.

(58) Digging for Dollars and Making Sense: Scholarship Beyond Academe.

In contrast to the scholars” of academe, contract archaeologists have been labeled shovel bums’
and their writings have been characterized as a grey literature that seldom makes connection with
the larger body of thought that constitutes our profession’s intellectual wealth and heritage. The first
paper explores why, justifiably, or otherwise, the onerous reputation has arisen. The next seven papers
are a forum for contract archaeologists working in central and southern Arizona to demonstrate their
scholarly participation in the marketplace of ideas. A critical paper out of academe evaluates the
scholarship of the Arizona cases. A summarist, with personal experience on both sides of the fence,
concludes with further rebuttal and evaluation.

(59) Evolution of Subsistence, Settlement, and Exchange on the Northern Channel Islands of Califor-
nia.

Recent research carried out on the four northern Channel Islands has substantially increased
knowledge of subsistence, settlement, and economic exchange systems over the course of the last
7000 years of prehistory, Systematic surveys have documented extensive occupation on all four of
the islands, and analyses of midden constituents have elucidated the development of marine resource
procurement systems, craft specialization, and regional exchange systems. Some of the papers in the
symposium concern one or more of these topics, while others concern the use of ethnohistoric data
to understand the archaeological record.

Pollen, Macrofossil, and Charcoal Analysis of Basketmaker Coprolites from Turkey Pen Ruin, Utah.

Located in southeastern Utah, Turkey Pen Ruin provides an excellent opportunity to study Anasazi
subsistence through well preserved remains. One of the most direct means of analyzing prehistoric
diet is to study the plant remains that feces contain. Twenty-eight human coprolites and two turkey
droppings were chosen for study. The pollen and macrofossil studies presented in this paper describe
what food plants the Basketmaker Anasazi ate, how they prepared these items, and at what time of
year the plants were gathered. {19}

Short-Term Ceramic Change During the Hohokam Sedentary/Classic Period Transition.

The ceramic chronology, as well as the changing structure of Hohokam society, is poorly understood
for the time between the late Sedentary and early Classic periods. But recent excavations at Las
Colinas, a village site in the Phoenix Basin, document an exceptionally welldated occupation that is
temporally placed to the Sedentary/Classic transition. The tight temporal control permits the analysis
of ceramic change with uncommon detail, informing about the evolving structure of Hohokam society
during a time of considerable change and, more generallly, about ceramic change in prehistoric
societies over the short term, (43)

Architecture, Labor and Social Class at Copan, Honduras.

Residential architecture is used as an index to measure soctal status differences at the Late Classic
Maya site of Copan, Honduras. Excavated residences representing the inferred range of socioeconomic
statuses are quantified in terms of energy costs, these total costs based on task-specific costs obtained
through replicative experiments. Energy differentials among structures are presented and interpreted
as being reflective of a tripartite labor recruitment system corresponding with the differential social
power associated with the commoner, lineage elite, and central elite sectors of Maya society. (||

Adaptive Changes in Prehistoric Hunter-Gatherer use of Wild Plant Resources: Evidence from Hancat
Cave.

The relationship between archaic and hunter-gatherer adaptive strategies and environmental changes
in central Arizona remains poorly understood. This is especially true with respect to the use of wild
plant resources. Data from recent excavations in a dry cave provide information concerning long term
changes in the use of wild plant resources, while fossil packrat midden analyses provide controls on
paleoenvironmental fluctuations during this period (ca. 8500-1500 BP). The resulting patterns in these
plant assemblages are integrated with a regional model of hunter-gatherer adaptive changes in the
Gila River Basin. (47)

Late Pleistocene/Early Holocene Archaeology of Southwestern Alaska with Implications for Eastern
Beringia.

The earliest archaeological tradition in Southwestern Alaska (Denali or Paleo-Arctic Tradition) can
be seen as an adaptation to the late Pleistocene/Early Holocene enyironment prior to the spread of
the Boreal Forest. Similar site complexes of this age range are noted for interior Alaska and the
southeastern coastal region. The relatively rapid spread of the Denali/Paleo-Arctic Tradition suggests
either moyements of groups of people into a more productive environment or the diffusion of a
cultural complex through earlier established peoples. As this tradition appears to be the earliest yet
known in Alaska with evidence indicating that it is derived from an older but similar Diuktai complex
from Siberia, it can be hypothesized that older sites if found in Alaska will be simply older versions
of the same tradition. (35)

Sand Canyon Pueblo: A Thirteenth Century Anasazi Ceremonial Center in Southwestern Colorado.

Large scale social and ritual networks are increasingly being recognized in prehistoric cultures of

A.D. 1200, centered around no more than eight ritual and exchange centers, This paper examines the
first year's excavation of and survey around one of these centers, Sand Canyon Pueblo, and ewaluates
lines of evidence supportive of its interpretation as a ceremonial center. |40)

Style, Basketry, and Basketmakers: Another Look.

For more than a decade it has been suggested that of all classes of artifactual material available to
the archaeologist for analysis, none has more potentially diagnostic features than basketry. Indeed,
on the broadest or “culture area” level down to the level of the individual maker, no commonly
recovered prehistoric artifact form has more culturally standardized and still visible attributes than
basketry. The definition and identification of style in prehistoric basketry from the level of a linguistic

‘ “population” of weavers through an individual maker is reiterated, refined, and illustrated through
i case studies. (16)

On the Quantitative Structure of Archaeological Data.
The useful application of quantitative methods to archaeological problems has been hindered by
\ many factors, but one that has received little attention is the failure by archaeologists to fully
7 understand the structure of archaeological data. Structure as used here has two components: (1) the
interrelationship of variables, measurement, and measurement reliability. These aspects of structure
. combine to create a continuum of the complexity of distributional forms in multidimensional space;
, and (2) the interrelationship of distributional form, technique, and definition of problem. A concep-
" tualization of structure in this framework clearly integrates the empirical problem of reliable data
v recovery and measurement with more theoretical issues of problem definition, variable selection, and
ef method choice. The implications of this view of structure are examined, and practical applications
of the concept are offered. (9)

4 On the northem Plains, particularly in the Dakotas, from 1945 to the early 1970s, archaeology was
Z dominated by site inventories and site excavations of the River Basin Surveys (RBS). Since the mid-
} 1970s a-broad range of physiographic and topographic areas have been surveyed through contract
archaeology. Thousands of sites have been recorded. The goal of these surveys, however, has shifted
E , from excavation to preservation. As only a limited amount of information can be gleaned from surface
survey and test excavations, contract archaeology has advanced our understanding of northern Plains
prehistory only slightly since the days of the RBS. (18)

Ceramic Style Frequencies in the Kayenta Anasazi Region, Northern Arizona.

A reexamination of dendrochronological evidence, combined with a seriation of single component
sites, reveals that temporal spans of Kayenta ceramic styles (types) are shorter than formerly assumed
and that the relative type frequencies at any given point in time can be delineated quite closely. This
allows more precise control for chronologically based studies, and provides the basis for looking at
old problems in new ways. The potential for demographic studies and the examination of the cyclic

‘ aspects of culture change are briefly explored. (1 1}

Dietary Reconstruction in Eastern and Southern Africa Based on Bone Collagen, Stable Carbon, and

used to differentiate between high and low protein diets, tropical grain and non-grain plant staple
diets, grazer- and browser-based pastoral or hunter diets, high and low legume plant diets, and marine
and terrestrial diets. We present the results and implications of the analysis of 140 historic and

Measuring Intensification.

Intensification is widely recognized as a significant process in changing hunter-gatherer production.

However, despite intensification’s theoretical importance, it remains poorly understood and difficult
to apply to the archaeological records of hunter-gatherers. The development of a model of hunter-

gatherer intensification with testable material correlates is an important step. The model presented
in this paper is tested against a well known example of intensification: maize in the Tehuacan Valley,
and a poorly known example: salmon on the Pacific coast of North America. 49}

Linguistic Implications for ARchaeological Study of the Hohokam Regional System.

Linguistic and archaeological data indicate that for two or more centuries near A.D. 1000, certain
Yuman groups lived in close association with speakers of Upper Piman, a language unrelated to
Yuman languages. Correlation of archaeological, ethnographic, and linguistic information leads to
the inference that Yuman-Piman bilingualism developed in the western portion of the Hohokam
culture area of southern Arizona. Comparison of Yuman and Hohokam burial practices strongly
supports the linguistic analysis. The study explores the implications for Hohokam cultural develop-

| ment within the framework of the recently proposed Hohokam Regional System concept. (3)

Disposition of Human Remains on Navajo Lands: Proposed Procedures.

Recent key Federal and Tribal legislation has often proved inadequate for dealing with human
remains. Because of this the Navajo Nation Division of Resources has developed a working set of
procedures for cultural resource managers and developers to follow in the identification, verification,
and ultimate disposition of human remains on Navajo land. These procedures attempt to address
legal and human concerns of next-of-kin, local residents, and the Tribe as a whole. This paper presents
these procedures along with suggestions for their modification for use elsewhere. (30)

The Origins and Evolution of Lithic Craft Specialization on the Channel Islands, California.
Recent field investigations on Santa Cruz Island reveal a chert microblade production industry of
; an intensity unparalleled in North America. Several island coastal sites bear densities of microblades
and cores from which they were manufactured in numbers exceeding thousands per cubic meter. The
origins and evolution of this industry are traced using excavation and survey data from these sites
and several others, including a dozen major quarries. It is demonstrated that the manufacturing
activities at certain of these sites represent true craft specialization. A definition of specialization and
several methods useful in identifying genuine lithic specialization are advanced. (59)

The Impact of Federal Archaeology in Alaska.

Federal archaeology in Alaska can be divided into two periods; Pre- and Post-pipeline. Before the
oil pipeline was built, federal involvement was limited largely to funding scholarly research. Since
pipeline construction, however, both agency archaeology and federal contract archaeology have grown
enormously, so that now almost all large and many small projects are carried out in response to federal
mandates and are supported by government funding. This paper examines the organizational and
substantive changes that have resulted and attempts to evaluate the contributions and shortcomings
of federal archaeology in Alaska. (18)

Research at the Magdalenian open air site of Verberie places emphasis on the integration of different
research approaches: flint and stone conjoining, experimentation, microwear analysis, faunal and
spatial analysis, and paleoenvironmental reconstruction. The Verberie living floor, organized into
activity and refuse areas around hearths, shows activity patterns related to reindeer hunting and game
processing, The presence of all stages of flint knapping and tool making at the site permit a reappraisal
of the ‘‘tool-kit’’ hypothesis. (4)

Architectural Variability in the Hohokam Classic Period.

The use of space is extremely variable during the Hohokam Classic period. Some Hohokam folk
lived in compounds, others lived in pithouses, while still others lived in above-ground surface struc-
tures. Evidence from the Rowley Site suggests that this variability can be understood as the differential
response to different groups of Hohokam folk. The Rowley site and other sites are examined in an
effort to understand the nature of the differences between these groups and to understand the archi-
tectural forms that occur during the Hohokam Classic period. (43)

A New Archaeological Assemblage for the Sierras de San Luis, Argentina.

Preliminary results from excavtions at Cerro Quemado site (320 47'S, 660 5'W),a rockshelter located
ca. 1700m above sea level in the Sierras de San Luis, Argentina, provide new evidence for the
interpretation of regional hunter-gatherer survival strategies. (1) Intihuasi | phase (Gonzalez, 1960),
was stratigraphically isolated and differentiated. (2) Detailed information is provided by diagnostic
artifacts in associa- tion with faunal remains from Cerro Quemado stratigraphic Levels II and II. (3)
Identified mammals include: Lama quanicoe, Ctenomys mendocinus, Galea musteloides and Lagos-
tomus among others. (4) Lama and small rodents seem to be primarily sources of protein in a non-
specialized hunter-gatherer pattern, mainly oriented toward the specialized exploitation of floral

Last Glacial Settlement Systems in Northwest Greece.

Investigations of Paleolithic settlement systems usually impose a tension between the analysis of
faunal and artifactual sequences from highly localized and not necessarily representative ‘‘sites’’ and

| models postulating dispersal of subsistence activities on a regional scale. This paper outlines some of
the methods and hypotheses being developed to address this problem in current fieldwork, and focuses
on four specific problem areas: (1) intra-site variation; (2) rationale of site location in a local paleoen-
vironmental setting, (3) inter-site variation on a regional scale; (4) long-term changes. (4)

Geographic Information Processing in Land Use Modeling and Testing in the Columbia River Basin.

Application of VICAR/IBIS Software using digitized terrain data and LANDSAT vegetation classi-
fication (prepared by the Washington Department of Game and the WSU Digital Image Processing
Lab} allow us to propose a greening-up" model describing the geographical availability of (1) plants
with edible roots used by human foragers, and (2) browse crucial to big game animals. Integration of
data for site type and location from the Washington State Computer Site Inventory make possible the
VICAR/IBIS catchment analysis (radius search function) necessary to describe relationships between
predicted plant and animal resource availability and prehistoric settlement patterns. Preliminary
modeling and testing results will be given. {6)

Stars and War at Cacaxtla.

The Cacaxtla murals are often described as a synthesis of Maya-Teotihuacan style and elements.
This paper focuses on one Teotihuacan derived element—a star shape—with limited use at Cacaxtla.
At Teotihuacan this element is found most often in two contexts: aquatic and militaristic. The latter
is consistent with its use at Cacaxtla and suggests continuity of meaning. It further suggests that
some of the glyphic elements at Cacaxtla are concise visual statements which derive their appearance
and meaning from more complete and complex mural and ceramic scenes at Teotihuacan, (20)

Southern High Plains-Southwestern Interaction: Late Evidence From the Conchas Reservoir Vicinity,
San Miguel County, New Mexico.

A recent reconnaissance of acreage surrounding Conchas Reservoir, located in the eastern portion
of San Miguel County, New Mexico, at the confluence of the Canadian and Conchas Rivers, indicates
the existence of an interaction network between aborigional inhabitants of the Southern High Plains
and the Southwest. The evidence recorded includes both lithic and ceramic artifacts. The lithic
assemblage consists of projectile point styles and raw material sources, such as Alibates chert and
obsidian, attributable to both geographic areas, Brownware and greyware ceramics attributable to the
southwest were also recovered. (45)

Megalithic Tomb Architecture and Ritual: An Americanist View.

Central Place Theory, Archaeoastronomy, transhumant cattle herders, egalitarian farmers, kings,
Mediterranean teams of priests or architects etc., fail to explain the evolution of Continental Norther
European megalithic tombs. Analysis of 4000 tombs suggest that these “‘shrines’’ lined (paved?) trade
routes which link major population centers. Originally conceived as permanent mortuary structures,
these “public’’ monuments fostered “pilgrimages” and rituals designed to integrate very diverse
socioeconomic systems in a woodland environment. The architecture reflects strong spatial jsocial?)
divisions, limited access, rights of passage, etc. Local and regional interpretations of the “mversal”’
ritual complex as well as their temporal changes are evident in the architecture. (56)

Application of Heavy Minerals Analysis to Anasazi Ceramics in Grand Canyon.

The geologic technique of heavy mineral analysis is used to characterize prehistoric Anasazi ceram-
ics from two areas within Grand Canyon National Park. Three questions concerning the use of the
analytical technique are posed: (1) can heavy mineral analysis be used to identify similarities and
differences in the raw materials used in ceramic production, (2) is the technique sensitive enough to
recognize slight differences in raw material sources, (3) is the technique feasible when standard ceramic
analysis cannot adequately address the research questions? Analysis of Grand Canyon ceramics
indicates that the technique is feasible for a variety of research questions. (40)

Cutting Plants, Scraping Wood, and Killing Bison,

Tools from small bison kills at the Lubbock Lake Site, Lubbock County, Texas, show undoubted
microscopic traces of use on wood and plants, as well as in butchering. These diverse activities and
the abundance of tools used in them contrasts with the small, uniform assemblages recovered from
most bison kills. This contrast apparently results from the organizational differences between com-
muna! and non-communal hunting. The former is quite predictable and requires an essentially
constant and high degree of organization and preparation wherever it is practiced, The latter is much
less predictable and its practice more closely reflects local adaptations and environmental conditions.

Color and Paste Compositional Relationships in Maya Ceramics: Palenque Mexico.

Covariation is sought between color and paste compositional groups derived from neutron activation
analysis. Munsell color data are analyzed for refired pottery having membership in the chemical
groups. The relationship of color (primarily reflecting iron concentration) to the multivariate elemen-
tal concentrations that characterize a chemical group is considered in the context of production and
exchange in Palenque region ceramics. Wider methodological issues relate to the utility of paste color
in proveniance studies. (40)

“Eafly State Formation in Italy: The Contribution of Archaeological Survey.

The archaeological investigations of the emergence of the Etruscan and allied states in Italy in the

« first millennium B.C. has traditionally concentrated on the major settlements and cemeteries and

their artifactual record. Hardly anything has been known of settlement trends at the regional scale,

or of relationships between population centers and their rural hinterlands, of the kind which are a

cornerstone of models of state formation in other parts of the world. This situation is finally being

rectified. The paper discusses the contribution of recent archaeological surveys in different parts of

the Italian peninsula to the study of early state formation, work which already points to far greater

regional complexity than hitherto supposed. (15)

Landscape Reconstruction for Investigating Protohistoric Landuse Patterns.

Archaeological research in intensive agricultural regimes which obscure the land surface often
requires reconstructing the original topography. Aerial photographic reconstruction of surface features
should be accompanied by subsurface exploration. Results are reported for a coring project in a Japanese
rice-paddy regime, which tested landform reconstruction against stratigraphy while trying to identify
palynologically postglacial marshlands that were turned into rice paddies by the earliest agricultur-
alists ca. 200 B.C. (2)

facilities in over 30 states. The project’s archaeological component has been completed following a
nationally applicable Work Plan. Most of the plans have been designed prior to any intensive field
survey, and each plan has been reviewed and accepted by the appropriate State Historic Preservation
Officer. The affected cultural resources range from Folsom sites through 18th century homesteads,
and rely on an evaluation of geomorphology and soils, land use history, and military construction
practices to identify areas of needed archaeological evaluation and management. (46)

Boundary Situations During the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene in the Levant.

Recent regional archaeological projects in the Mediterranean Levant which focused on questions
of chronology, technology, paleoecology, and site typology allow a delimitation of Upper Paleolithic
and early Neolithic cultures in the area. The reconstructed regional settlement and interaction
patterns permit a preliminary evaluation of cultural boundaries as well as an examination of changes
in boundaries from the Levantine Paleolithic to the early Neolithic. The paper will also examine the
relative importance of the observed changes (both climatic and cultural) for the establishment of early
farming communities. (4)

Late Prehsitoric Southern Plains Economies.

A number of recent studies have focued on Southern Plains/Southwest exchange. These in turn
have presented two contrasting models of this late prehistoric/protohistoric exchange system without
providing conclusive results. This paper will examine the internal structure of trade for the Edwards
and Garza complexes of the Southern Plains providing the spatial dimension for this study. Recent
obsidian hydration dates will provide the temporal framework. By this means, the nature of the
internal alliance structures and exchange processes can be evaluated against the two models of
Southern Plains/Southwest exchange. (45)

A Technological Analysis of Flake Production at the Middle Paleolithic Site of Zobiste in Central
Yugoslavia.

Recent excavations at the Middle Paleolithic open-air station of Zobiste in Northern Bosnia,
Yugoslavia, have yielded a well-documented assemblage comprising over 4000 pieces of chipped
stone. Two major aspects of this lithic industry, observed in collections from neighboring sites as
well, include the co-occurrence of laminar and radial flake preparation and the joint production of
naturally backed and Levallois flake blanks for use as tools. Interpretations for this technological
pattern are offered within the framework of a model of continuous lithic reduction based upon
quantitative measurements of core preparation. (40)

The Pagarectambo Project: An Interm Report.

The Pagarectambo Archaeological Project is an intensive survey of a remote region of the central
highlands of Peru (Cuzco). It will provide the first and second phases of a long-term, multi-stage
inves,tigation of the diverse cultural histories and adaptive strategies of the area's prehistoric popu-

lation. While the thrust of the study is aimed at describing the Huari and Inca expansions into the
area, the settlement systems of the Early Horizon, Early Intermediate, Late Intermediate and the
present day occupations are also being investigated. The paper presents the specific objectives, pro-
cedures and results from the project's first field season. (40)

Interpreting Variation in Archaic Patterns of Animal Utilization.

Optimal foraging theory predicts that levels of utilization efficiency for hunter-gatherer groups will
vary with the potential energetic return rate of a given habitat. A technique for measuring selective

efficiency in archaeofaunal assemblages is proposed. Comparison of efficiency indices zmong wariass
Archaic Period and later Hohokam faunal assemblages are made to partition the relative influence of
habitat productivity and logistical foraging behavior on variation in Archaic faunal use peers. Data
tend to support the prediction for tpiddle Archaic contexts but patterns are less clear tor later periods
where variation appears to be directly linked to changes in mobility and economic orgamizanon. as

Late Classic Painted Ceramics as Indicators of Social Class.

Painted ceramics in caches and ritually appointed burials suggest that these objects relate to high
status or access to scarce resources. Other data, however, indicate all levels of Copanec society had
access to painted ceramics. A question is thus raised as to the social significance of these goods,
Variation in consumption patterns of various painted ceramic types in the Copan Valley suggest that
the ceramic groups functioned differently during the Late Classic. The correlation of ceramics and
social class is presented at a type-specific level but other cultural factors also are determining the use
of painted pottery. (1)

Pottery Diversity and Political Centralization.

The relationship between political/administrative centralization and craft production has been of
major interest to archaeologists recently. One general model has proposed that political centralization
correlates with increased administrative involvement in craft production, which leads to decreased
product diversity. This paper presents a case study which refutes the model. Archaeological evidence
from a historical, multi-component site in North Africa suggests that inceased political/administra-
tive involvement in the regional economy had minimal impact on local ceramic production. A
hierarchical diversity index, which measures both functional and morphological-compositional aspects
of ceramic variety, is used to detect the absence of change in pottery diversity. (11)

Sedentism, Storage, and Production and the Question of Change.

Much recent analysis of change within hunter-gatherer, or from hunter-gatherer to farmer societies
has focused on the prerequisites for, and the effects of, increased sedentism and storage. Often these
phenomena have been related to specific environmental or demographic conditions. This paper, while
giving due weight to environmental potential, wil! focus on the socio-historical configuration within
which productive relations are embedded, and on the dialectical relation between ideology, power,
and material provisioning. Contemporary and prehistoric case studies will be used to illustrate the
argument. (49)

The Adaptive Role of the Mountains in High Plains Prehistory: A Reassessment of the Refugium
Hypothesis.

The effects of the Altithermal climatic episode on the high altitude occupations of the Northwestern
Plains are considered. The traditional model of the mountains as an Altithermal refugium is rejected
in light of: (1) problems in the definition of the cultural and climatological components of the model,
(2) problems in correlating large-scale climatic episodes with small-scale adaptive processes, and (3)
the evidence of high country chronologies. (32)

Residential Mobility in the Evolution of Non-Egalitarian Societies.

A model is developed for predicting the maximum amount of social structural differentiation
possible in a group, based on extra-group options reflected in residential mobility. The conditions
under which grouping and differentiation are advantageous, the factors limiting dominance, and the
effects of kinship on cooperation and competition are outlined. The utility of the model in explaining
social organizational and social structural change is assessed in an application to the prehisitoric
American Southwest, (17)

Maize Ear Morphology: Racial Variation in Mexico.

The recent theory by H.H. IItis on the origin of the maize ear by catastrophic sexual transmuation
(CST) stresses inflorescence homologies between the ear of maize and the tassel spike of its ancestor
teosinte. It also provides the basis for understanding the morphological complexity of the maize ear,
Identification of the extant priminitve Mexican maize races is contingent upon the realization of
these homologies, The biogeography of Mexican maize races sheds light on the origin of maize and
on the dispersal of maize by prehistoric societies in Mesoamerica. Maize from archaeological sites in
the Valleys of Tehuacan, Oaxaca, and Mexico are examined in relation to these findings and to a
tentative phylogenetic classification of Mexican maize races. (19)

Writing in Central Mexico: A.D. 700-900.

Studies of Mesoamerican writing systems have focused overwhelmingly on Maya hieroglyphs, with
the Aztec, Mixtec, and Zapotec systems receiving much less attention. In particular, the roots of
writing in Central Mexico have not been carefully examined. Although the Central Mexican epi-
graphic system is best known from late pre-Conquest and early Colonial pictorial manuscripts,
fragmentary evidence in less perishable materials demonstrates that some basic principles of Central
Mexican writing were in use by Phase One of the Second Intermediate Period. Sites to be examined
in this paper include Xochicalco, Cacaxtla, and Teotenango, with particular emphasis placed on
Xochicalco’s stone monuments. These will be discussed as a major public statement of calendrical,
religious, and political information during this period. (20)

Other Lands: The Challenge of Ethnohistory to the New Sciences.

Both the New Archaeology and the New History were representative of the epistemological shift
in social thought seen in the 1960's. Each attempted to rectify the perceived failings of its discipline,
with its emphasis on; (1) description, (2) narrative cultural history, (3) the event as explanation and
(4) the impact of economic and political elites. Instead, both new schools stressed; (1) long term
economic and ecological trends, (2) underlying system dynamics as explanation and (3) economic
rationality. Both schools developed methods which stressed the quantitative analysis of “hard data”’
in a search for “objective” laws of human nature. However, recent ethnohistorical research, which
explores the importance of cultural mediating processes in historical perception, raises key doubts
about the suitability of these new social sciences for cultures where the ‘economic man” does not
hold sway. (2)

Use-Wear Analysis and the Concept of Efficiency.

This paper describes results of a high-power use-wear analysis of flint tools from some Dutch
Neolithic sites. One aim of the study is the identification and measurement of efficiency in tool
manufacture and use at the sites. An efficient use of raw material, for example, is one in which the
amount of waste is very low, compared to the amount of usable raw materials produced, The results
are ambiguous; some measures indicate relatively efficient tool manufacture and use, others do not.
This suggests that the concept of efficiency as currently defined does not adequately account for
prehistoric tool maufacture and use behavior evident in the archaeological record. One reason for this
may be the asssumption archaeologists hold that efficiency 1s a natural, rather than culture-specific,
motive for human action. (57)

Taphonomy at a Distance: Zhoukoudian.

The site of Zhoukoudian has figured prominently in our literature on hominid adaptations during
the Middle Pleistocene yet has been subjected to little systematic analysis. This paper is an attempt

original cave and assesses the spatial distribution of animal bones, stone tools, and of modified lithic
pieces in relation to the original morphology of the cave. (4)

Survey in Greece.

The history of archaeological field survey in Greece can be divided into distinct phases; in each
successive period both techniques and research aims have become more sophisticated. Increasingly
wider spatial coverage has encouraged both regional and national analyses of settlement patterns and
the employment of approaches taken from modern geography and sociology. For the prehistoric periods
it is timely to ask how rigorously current interpretive models fit the available data base. The latest
results from field experiments with prehistoric material suggest we may indeed be entering 2 new
phase of reorientation and reevaluation in both theory and practice, with unpredictable results. 15}

Exchange and Interaction in the Dolores Project Area,

Exchange is expected to link social groups that share kinship or other relationships, to serve as an
economic buffer both within and between communities, and to be a means of accumulating and
demonstrating economic and social power. Spatial and temporal variation in resource supply, popu-
lation movement and aggregation, and the potential for economic and social differentiation lead to
predictions for changes in exchange networks within the Dolores area. These predictions are evaluated
through the occurrences of non-local materials in the Dolores area sites. (44]

Scavenging Opportunity in the Seregeti and Ngorongoro Ecosystems.

The scale and characteristics of scavenging opportunity are effected by a number of factors, includ-
ing: (1) patterns of carcass consumption by primary consumers, (2) carcass size in relation to consumer
type and number, and (3) carcass density distributions in relation to carnivore density distributions,
and seasonal, daily and micro-habitat variations. These factors are discussed in terms of possible
characteristics of a hominid scavenging niche, which is suggested to have a strong seasonal and micro-
habitat component, focusing on adult medium sized ungulates from which marrow as well as flesh
can be regularly procured. (37)

The Dynamics of Rodent Disturbance: Its Effects on Archeological Deposits

Studies of burrowing rodent ecology are used to identify the dynamics of rodent disturbance, and
its peculiar effects on archeological site contents. Burrowing activity appears to : (1) cause downward
displacement of site contents into underlying strata, (2) create artificial concentrations of small-sized
materials near the surface, (3) create apparent horizons of larger materials at depths of 30-60 cm, and
(4) cause minimal horizontal displacement, relative to vertical movement. In order to illustrate these
processes, predicted patterns are compared with data from excavations in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Quantifying Shell Middens Using a Visual Estimation Technique

Sampling shell middens for quantitative studies can produce large amounts of material, which are
time consuming to collect and expensive to transport and curate. A visual estimation technique using
photographs and a standardized comparator offers a rapid, accurate, low weight alternative. The
technique produces a permanent record, has a minimum threshold of ca. 40g shell/100 cm’, and
correlates well with results from column samples. Visual estimation is useful where speed is impor-
tant, where expenses must be minimized, or where, as in the case of museum collections, only

photographic records are available. This paper explores the technique using examples from Cape Cod,
Massachusetts. {12}

of hook and line was replaced by netting as the prevailing method of procuring fish. It is suggested
that hook and line fishing resulted in selective pressure on larger individual fish, size of catch per
unit of effort declined, and the technological response of human groups was to concentrate on netting
smaller fish. Implica, tions regarding Late Period social organization and development of the regional
economic system are discussed. (59)

Chacoan Archaeology in the Montezuma Valley, Southwestern Colorado.

A Chacoan Anasaazi presence in southwestern Colorado has been identified as having occurred
during the late 11th and early 12th centuries A.D. This occurrence is explained by a process of
religious and economic colonization which is illustrated by a hierarchy of settle,ment types including
mission sites, convert communities, and tributary sites. Additonal sites which exhibit no Chacoan
connections have also been identified. This model has been constructed using data from the Chaco
Project and seven completely or partially excavated sites in the Mesa Verde region. (3)

Making an Impression: Illinois Woodland Pottery Design and Social Interactions.

Can we treat the decoration on Woodland pottery as a consequence of social processes that affected
the artisans’ decorative decisions at several different levels? In addressing this question, the paper
also discusses the implications of this idea for how we go about studying regional “tribal’’ social
processes, and some of the site formation processes that affect comparability among samples across
a tegion. Data from three sample locations in Illinois are used to pursue questions of how social
relations across the region varied over time, and what this variation may tell us about “tribal” social
processes in general. (16)

of the cultural resources represent Basketmaker III colonization of the area shortly after A.D. 600 and
growth and change of those populations through the next four centuries, As part of the culture process

Activity-Induced Shape Change in the Human Lower Limbs Through Time in the Prehistoric South-
west.

A series of archaeological hypotheses concerning changes in the human behavioral adaptive patterns
are examined using human skeletal remains from prehistoric sites in the eastern Southwest. These
changes are related to four dimensions: time, topography, intra- and inter sexual differences. Detailed
biomechanical analyses of human locomotor anatomy precisely evaluate alterations in levels and
patterns of activity induced bone hypertrophy. The bone changes follow normal patterns of bone
remodeling well documented through orthopedic research. Significant diachronic changes in skeletal
morphology are correlated with archacological postulates of hurnan adaptation in the prehistoric
Southwest. (2)

Observed Mortuary Practices From La Cueva de los Muertos Chiquitos, Near Zape Chico, Durango,
Mexico.

Two series of infant and child burials were found under puddled adobe floors below an occupation
midden, in a dry cave near Zape Chico, Durango, Mexico. The number of burials and the age deter
minations were interpreted as possible epidemics which affected infants and children at two different
times. The care taken in preparing the bodies for burial implies relatively complex mortuary practices,
as do the accompanying food offerings, and individual grave goods. From these data speculatsons ar=
derived as to the social significance of the burials. (28)

Economic Models in the Pre-Incaic Andean State.

Models for the economic organization of pre-Incaic states include concepts such as stable finance,
vertical mobilization, corvee labor recruitment, market exchange, etc. The focus is upon the political
economy of two selected areas—the Mantaro and Titicaca basins—in the central and southern sierra
during the Middle Horizon and Late Intermediate Period. Current amongst Andeanists is a model of
Inca economic organization, popularized by French Marxists, which does not accurately reflect the
complexities of the pre-Incaic system. As the Inca were opportunistic, incorporating extant systems
within their state, explication of pre-Incaic systems will aid in redefining the resultant Incaic economic
system, (28)

Quantitative Comparative Analysis of Artifact Assemblages in Retrospect,

This paper reviews the accomplishments of the quantification of the methods for approaching the
problem of comparing artifact assemblages. Typically, this approach compares two or more sets of
objects within a particular domain of objects (e.g., material culture traits, lithic artifact types, ceramic
style types), Common quantitative methods used to facilitate analysis are cluster analysis and prin-
ciple components analysis, From the perspective of hindsight these and other methods will be eval-
uated for their contribution to the subject of inter-assemblage comparison. (9)

Urban Archaeology and History in a Twilight Zone: 13 Blocks on the Edge of Downtown Houston,
Texas.

Houston, Texas was founded in 1836 as an inland coastal plain trade center. With the exception of

one decade (1850s), Houston has grown at a rapid rate. Unfortunately little archaeology has been
~ conducted during this growth. Recently, excavation was conducted in a 13 block area of the near

downtown. This area began as a residence zone, developed into a wealthy residential zone, and then

began to go “downhill” into poor residential/light commercial. This paper outlines the tremendous

amount of archaeological data, interpreting it in light of available historic documents. Much was

recovered that was not found within these documents. (30)

Temporal and Spatial Change in Pomona Ceramics: A Plains Village Variant in Eastern Kansas and

Western Missouri.

Development of rim types, based on discrete rim and lip forms, are analyzed by: (1) relative
frequencies and (2) cluster analysis. Results of the cluster analyses indicate it is not sensitive to
temporal and/or spatial trends. Pottery characteristics that are sensitive to temporal and spatial change
are: (1) shell temper, (2) cordmarked lips, (3) collared rims, (4) crenated and scalloped lips, and (5)
knobbed rims and lips. Eight river drainages in eastern Kansas and western Missouri are used to
delineate, geographically, the occurrence of rim and lip decorative elements and types of tempering
materials. (11)

The Brady Wash Complex: A Classic Period Hohokam Community.

A major goal of the Tucson Aqueduct project is to delineate Hohokam cultural development in the
Brady Wash area. Prehistoric occupation spanned the late Colonial Period through the very late Classic
Period representing intensive, long-term exploitation of a marginal environment. This sequence
culminated in a Classic Period settlement with hamlets arranged around a centrally located platform
mound. The project affords a unique opportunity to document community structure and to explore
the socioplitical implications of platform mounds.4@ Classic Period settlements, (43)

Los Muertos: The Dead Can Rise Again.

An analysis of mortuary data from the Classic period Hohokam site of Los Muertos is presented.
Located in the present-day Phoenix/Tempe metropolitan area, the site was farmed under by the
1930's. Fortunately, notes and data were collected by Frank Hamilton Cushing, as director of the
Southwestern Hemenway Expedition, in 1887 through 1888. Cushing’s excavation team collected
over 500 cremations and inhumations, providing one of the largest Classic period Hohokam burial
data sets known. A reconstruction of the excavation data provides a means to analyze variability in
burial methods and accompanying artifacts for this important Classic period site. (3)

Abstract Western Archaic Rock Art: Chronological and Behavioral Propositions.

A widely distributed style of rock art of western North America has been identified by many
investigators as a probably early style related to Archaic stage occupations. An early date of the style
is verified from an investigation of a uniquely exposed site in southeastern Colorado. Comparisons
of manifestations of the style elsewhere are made and behavioral characteristics of makers of the style
are proposed. The later predictions are based upon ethnoarchaeological data and ethnographic descrip-
tions of peoples who made similar art historically. (36)

Diet, Sedentism, and Demographic Change: Identifying Key Variables.

The explanation of past demographic change is crucial in the study of human evolution and
adaptation. Key issues include the relationship of sedentism and dietary change to population increase,
and the relative importance of altered fertility and mortality patterns in human prehistory. Skeletal
series can provide data which may be more pertinent than many studies of living human groups which
have informed previous archaeological discussions of these issues, To demonstrate this point, an
analyasis of Woodland and Mississippian skeletal series is reported which shows interrelationships
of fertility, diet, technology and sedentism. (51)

Prehistory in the Nuclear Age.

The structure and behavior of the atom are under current development as an analytical anthropology
approach to prehistory, By integrating biological/archaeological anthropology and analytical/isotope
chemistry, one can specify biocultural contexts with known accuracy and reproducibility in space
and time. Ecological and dietary information are contained in the chemistry of biological remains.
The simple, single element system of 13C/12C analysis provides an estimate of maximum proportions
of meat, maize, and other vegetables in diets of individuals. Multi-element and multi-isotopic faunal
studies reveal changing animal-plant resource patterns. New multi-variate models correctly apportion
chemical variation in remains to the dietary, physiological, ecological, and diagenetic sources. {2}

Olduvai Bone Assemblages and Early Hominid Subsistence Strategies.

Taphonomic analysis of fossil and bone assemblages from a 2 to 1.5 million year old Olduyai site
and middle range research provide a basis for evaluating and augmenting current models of early
hominid subsistence behavior. Using data on faunal size, skeletal part representation, butchery
patterns and age structure, it is evident that early hominids were not the most marginal of scavengers
operating at abandonded, large carnivore kill sites; rather, hominids transported systematically butch-
ered meaty parts of carcasses obtained through scavenging and hunting to favored locales for further
processing. (47)

Microdebitage or Geodebitage? Problems in Distinguishing

Cultural from Natural Sediment Particles.

A major problem indicated in the study of the microscopic byproducts of lithic reduction is routinely
distinguishing cultural from natural sediment particles. This paper is concerned with exploring this
problem, and specific areas of focus include the natural occurrence of sediment particles of materials
commonly used in lithic reduction, the natural reduction forces which produce particles resembling
microdebitage, and diagenetic factors affecting identification. The use of controls in dealing with the
identification problems is also discussed. (8)

Prehistoric use of Landscapes and the Archaeological Surface Distribution.

Patterning in the sizes of quantitatively-defined archacological scatters is used in this paper to
investigate variable histories of landscape and location use. The approach used here views such
patterning from the perspective of historical accumulation of scatters. From this perspective the size
distributions of archaeological scatters within a region provide evidence for histories of prehistoric
group movement and the resultant accumulation of archaeological debris on a landscape. Several
landscape histories including moderate and intensive reuse of landscapes are interpreted from this
investigation of scatter size variation. (26)

An approach which contrasts generative rules for motifs with those for design configuration sub-

stylistic studies. By extension, the separate comparison of simi,larities and differences in the expres-
sion of motifs and design configu,rations between two stylistic systems yields a general model of the
structure of information exchange. These similarities and differences relate to learning, influencing,
imitating, substituting, and signaliz,ing behavior. Implications of this model] for archaeological studies

predominantly focused upon large open sites in river valleys and rock shelters. A recently completed

intensive. Certain areas, however, appear to have been repeatedly occupied in order to exploit lithic
resources and upland game such as deer and bison, (40)

by noting how the range of variation in an attribute's states affects its position within the hierarchies.

The hierarchy of manufacturing steps and that of manufacturing decisions are distinguished by |
contrasting additive, subtractive, and complex (¢.g. weaving) art processes. (16)

Settlement Reorganization in an Inhabited Palauan Village.

Archaeological settlements often exhibit evidence of reorganization of large spatial areas. This site
reformation behavior was documented recently in Irrai Village, Republic of Palau. Comparing the |
recent survey data to a 1909 map of the same village reveals that a massive rearrangement of the
central stone platform and pathway complex has taken place. However, oral information concerning |
these site modifications contradict the archaeological evidence: several features that are thought of
as very old are in fact relatively recent in origin. This paper discusses this contradiction between
archaeological observation and oral history, as well as settlement reformation processes in general.

Specialization in Local and State Ceramic Production in the Upper Mantaro Valley, Peru. |

Direct (distribution of wasters and tools) and indirect (paste characteristics, standardization) evi- |
dence is examined to delimit the organization of pottery production before (Wanka Il) and after (Wanka
Ml) Inka conquest. In Wanka II ceramic production was a household-based activity, specialized at the |
village level. Although in Wanka III increased social stratification and regional peace were expected
to promote further specialization, it appears that Inka domination did not radically affect the orga- |
nization of production in local wares. Extreme standardization of Inka style ceramics and lack of Inka
production debris in domestic contexts suggest manufacture for state distribution at centralized, |
special purpose facilities. {10}

Population and Individual Movement,

Migrations were popular at one time in archaeology, then they went out of fashion and ‘‘migration-
ism” was condemned. Yet, individuals always move around some, and displacements of groups are
more rare but not really uncommon. Moreover, at times of population growth, its expansion is often
anatural, sometimes unavoidable consequence. It is planned to review studies on individual mobility,
and examples of population expansions and their contributions to patterns of human genetic variation
will be given. (17)

Fifty Years of Federal Archaeology in the Middle South: An Assessment.

In 1934, federal archaeology in the Middle South began with the initiation of reservoir projects by
the Tennessee Valley Authority in the Tennessce River drainage. For the next eight years, large scale
excavations generated vast amounts of data, trained a generation of archaeologists, and established a
cultural/historical framework for the region. A second surge of archaeology began in the 1960s, and
has grown concomitantly with federal legislation. This paper explores and assesses the achievements
and contributions of this half-century of federally sponsored archaeology. (18)

Systemic Evolutionary Interpretation of Woodland Burial Practices in West-Central Illinois.

A distinction bewtween ideology-free hunter-gatherers and ideology-bearing stratified societies
defuses the theoretical basis of a developing debate between Saxes-Binfordian and structural Marxist
mortuary analysis. Published applications of either approach are based on invalid assumptions equat-
ing operationally-defined variability with meaningful categories. To overcome this problem, a sys-
temic evolutionary model is applied to Middle and Late Woodland burial mounds in west-central
Illinois, Results indicate that the elaborate tomb/ramp complex of Middle Woodland is part of a ritual
response to internal village fissioning stresses. However, the specific use and characterization of
mounds are products of constraining tradition rather than functional requirements. (33)

From the Outside Looking In: Peten Perspectives on Belize.

The Peten of Guatemala presents a cultural mosaic during the Post-classic period. The regionality
that is evident, however, shows striking archaeological variation in ntual and settlement patterns
from similar data found in Postclassic Belize. These archaeological data in fact suggest that the central
portion of Belize may have been purposely maintained as a cultural frontier by the native elites of
central Peten. Careful management and manipulation of this frontier by Peten peoples allowed for
their independent status through much of the Postclassic and Historic period. (21)

Postclassic pottery and artifact assemblages as well as construction techniques and settlement pattern.
These data strongly suggest that Santa Rita represented the political interests of its northern allies
during the Late Postclassic period and that Santa Rita’s response to the Spanish was conditioned by
its close participation in political networks to its north. (21)

Approaches to Middle Paleolithic Subsistence.

Middle Paleolithic zooarchaeology is severely hampered by problems inherent in the nature of the
sites at the present state of geochronology. Because assemblages from different sites cannot, even if
geologically correlated, be assumed to be contemporary in an anthropological sense, it is impossible

© to reconstruct any single Middle Paleolithic subsistence system. However, by comparing the faunal
data known from sites in Europe with nonfaunal data, it is possible to infer the general nature of
Middle Paleolithic subsistence systems. (47)

Hunter-Gatherer Adaptations and Site Structure: An Evaluation of Dimensions.

Access to numerous alternative dimensions of site structure will allow students of prehistoric

of adaptive strategy—mobility, predation, and technology—are isolated and their constituent ele-
ments are analyzed to identify material correlates. Those correlates are proposed as dimensions at
site structure and measures of adaptation type. The utility of selected dimensions is evaluated by
comparing late prehistoric assemblages from the Columbia Plateau with a model derived from eth-
nographies. Outcomes are discussed, especially where observations and expectations diverge. (47)

Construction Activity and Sociocultural Integration at Copan.

A question still debated among Mesoamerican scholars is the kind of sociocultural integration
exhibited by the Maya. A commonsense, but also debated, measure of this aspect of culture is the
amount of energy that can be consistently harnessed and expressed by a society. This paper will
discuss the utility of this measure and compare the amount of construction at Copan with those few
sites for which compar,able information is available or can be constructed. From this comparison an
indication of differential levels of contro! over resour,ces and, therefore, of level of sociocultural
integration can be derived. (1)

blages of the second tradition have less broken and damaged bones which may suggest the subsistence
strategy was less devoted to hunting. (47]

Technology and Ideology in Artifact Design of Early Iron Age Refractories in Iron Smelting.

Technological behavior involved in the design and manufacture of refractory ceramics essential to
iron smelting during the Early Iron Age in East Africa is influenced by functional requirements of the
smelting process, available resources, and traditions of local craft production. Ethnographic evidence
of African smelting also reveals that a strong ideology surrounding the technplogy influences the
production process and the design of some refractories. The secrecy which often encompasses the
smelting process, however, will restrict the visibility of the technological and ideologically-based
attributes to a select group, The behavioral meaning of these attributes must be carefully interpreted
by archaeologists. (16)

Paleoecological Modeling of Fire Adaptations by Hunters and Gatherers in Southern California,

Several references by early Spanish explorers relate two tnigmatic aspects of southern California

A botanical approach to the fire adaptation of the local ecosystem provides a paleoecological model
for both hunting and gathering regimes. Previous studies on the elfects of fires in Mediterranean
climate ecosystems will be applied to current knowledge of the varied prehistoric groups in cismontain

Ecological research directed toward an understanding of the resource base during the late Upper
Paleolithic and Mesolithic in Cantabrian Spain has identified regional patterns in human adaptation
which depart radically from the conventional picture of terminal Pleistocene hunter-gatherers known
before 1980. Paleoclimatic oscillations show little direct effect on human settlement patterns and
subsistence strategies even in the face of inferred major changes in resource distributions which
coincide with and transcend the Pleistocene/Holocene boundary, Site distributions and settings,
technologies and subsistence data are examined for the period 21,000-3,500 B-P. Directional changes
in settlement and subsistence are documented and compared with an “ethnographic present’ known
from classical sources. The impact of domestication economies is assessed. (4)

Accumulated Data: Pollen Analysis and Anasazi Subsistence in the Four Corners Area, American
Southwest.

The role of the archaeobotanist is twofold—to analyze and describe plant remains from archaeo-
logical sites (laundry list) and to give the results meaning in terms of prehistoric subsistence. The
description and analysis of botanical remains is a standard part of archaeological inquiry, where plant
foods of economic value or potential are defined. This data is of limited use when used only in the
context of the specific site or sites in question. Over the past 15 years, increases in site mitigations
for the purposes of institutional research or cultural resource management have brought about numer-
ous botanical analyses from archaeological sites in the San Juan Basin of the American Southwest. A
large data base of botanical interest has accumulated. Due to standardized sampling techniques
archaeobotanical information from many sites may be reliably evaluated. As a result, regional sub-
sistence patterns are emerging for the prehistoric era, Discussed will be aspects of Anasazi subsistence
recognizable from the viewpoint of pollen analysis (i.¢., resource procurement, changes in plant usage).

A Model for the Organization of Production of the Mill Creek Chert Biface Industry.

Southwestern Illinois was the locus of the production of large bifaces from a local lithic resource—
Mill Creek chert—in the Mississippian period. Evidence for intensive manufacture and subsequent
widespread exchange of these bifaces has led some investigators to conclude that production was
centrally organized by elites. Recent research suggests a dispersed pattern of production with the
means of production controlled at the community level. A model is proposed where elites controlled

: the dispersal of bifaces, and thus access to the effects of production, rather than the means of
~™ production, may have heen the major source of power for an emerging Mississippian elite class. (49)

Measured in Metaphors: Settlement Plan and the Perception of Space.

Archaeologists can and are using settlement plans to reconstruct past behavior (and behavioral
models to account for past settlement patterns), but the builders’ attitudes toward space and settle-
ment are more elusive to reconstruct. Assuming that past behavior can be inferred from settlement
plans, then past perceptions can be measured in the metaphors of spatial relationships symbolically
encoded in settlement plans. This paper discusses how archaeologists can begin to uncover spatial
metaphors, as well as how these metaphors can be used to reconstruct impressions and attitudes of
spatial use among past cultures, using an example drawn from the pioneer Illinois experience. (24)

nutrition suggest economic stratification cross-cutting lines of ethnic demarcation. Patterns of inter-

very flexible settlement and subsistence strategies, and differences in degree rather than kind. (52)

Household Production and Village Specialization in the Upper Mantaro Valley, Peru.

Excavations were conducted at six archaeological sites representing pre-Inka (Wanka I) and Inka
(Wanka III) periods in this highland Peruvian valley. Structures are organized into walled compounds
(households) of one to six buildings. The distribution of agricultural tools indicates all households
were involved in agricultural production. In contrast, the distribution of manufacturing debris suggests
craft production was specialized. Some production (metal, weaving) was concentrated in elite house-
holds at all sites, while other items (ceramics, stone tools) were produced by both commoner and
elite households, but at a limited number of sites. Evidence for production in non-domestic contexts
was also recovered. (48)

of modern pollen rain samples. In addition, principal-component analysis is used in the interpretation
of the archaeological pollen assemblage. (19)

, 68 Cross, John R.
Previous research in Long House Valley, immediately to the east, indicated a change in settlement
pattern around A.D. 1150. At that time sites began to cluster around large defensible “focal” sites,
apparently in response to intergroup raiding. To determine whether the conflict was localized or
regional, the GIS was used to generate maps pinpointing hillltops and vantage points likely to have
harbored defensive occupations. The production of the maps, trends in data analyzed to date, and
possible refinements of variables used are discussed. (6)

Craft Specialization: Contrasts Between Non-stratified and Stratified Societies.

In recent years, archaeologists have become increasingly aware of the limitations of band-tribe-
chiefdom or mode-of-production categories for understanding variation in the organization of produc-
tion within non-stratifed societies. ‘Craft specialization” and ‘‘surplus’’ are now terms frequently
applied to hunter-gatherers. However, craft specialization among hunter-gatherers and within state-
level society reflect differences in kind; not simply in depree~ Specialization is sustained and trans-
formed through fundamentally different social processes in each instance, This paper uses the eth-
nographic and archaeological literature to derive a model for Late Archaic lithic tool production in
the Northeast. (49)

Classic Period Hohokam Land Use and Settlement Along the Gila River.

Surveys and excavations along the Gila River between Florence and Casa Grande have provided
sufficient information on habitation site and agricultural feature location to allow preliminary assess-
ment of land use and settlement patterning. The location of permanent habitation and field house
sites relative to irrigation, dry farming, and floodwater farming features suggests differential control
of farmed land and decreasing intensity of land use with distance from the Gila River. These patterns
of land use within the diverse subsis-tence system have implications for our understanding of the
structure of Hohokam economy in this area. (43)

Archaic Subsistence and Seasonal Population Flow, Northwest New Mexico.

Vegetative diversity (variety of exploitable plant species) may not be the salient clue to the recurrent
assocation of Archaic habitations with upland dunes although diversity considered on a regional scale
may be a good discriminating tool for predicting Archaic population flow in relation to resource
procurement. A case for seasona! population moyement in the Four Corners area is constructed on
the basis of patterning of available floral resources. Archaeological evidence, including botanical
remains, points to short-term occupation of dune sites during summer months. The distance of
habitats able to provide alternative resources in winter months |or under poor climatic conditions) is
seen to require wholesale movement to these areas. Closer juxtaposition of divers habitat types
elsewhere may have resulted in entirely different demographic patterns. (38)

The Effects of the Inka Conquest on the Wanka Domestic Economy.

This paper presents a summary discussion of the domestic economy of the late prehistanc Wankas
prior to and under the Inka empire. Patterns of domestic activities within elite and commoner
households are compared for Wanka I (A.D. 1250-1460) and Wanka III (A.D, 1460-1533) communines.
Functional analyses of ceramics, access to goods, and use of space indicate that the impact of the Inka
conquest on household activities was limited. Although social stratification Increased, the besic
organization of production and consumption was remarkably constant, suggesting that the Inka relied
on existing relationships in their dealings with subject populations. (10)

Domestic and Community Production in the Early Northern Andean Village.

Patterns in prehistoric architecture and domestic refuse convey information on the early Valdivia
{3300-2300 B,C.) house and household production. Material is analyzed from several house structures
and occupational surfaces from Real Alto (|OGSECH-012) of coastal Ecuador. Tools, paleobotanical
specimens, faunal remains, etc., provide data on economic pursuits of small nuclear family units and
social organization is implied in domestic spacing. A model is derived which accounts for the change
in relations of social and economic production and the development of hierarchical social groupings
from egalitarian structures in the early Valdivia community. Methodological implications are also
explored and indicate that the household unit is well suited for the study of site formation processes,
paleoeconomy and social spacing. (48)

found woefully inadequate for most management purposes and for all but the most general academe

Possible Causes for Bison Bone Breakage at an Antelope Creek Focus Site.

Excavations at Landergin Mesa (41OL2) were conducted under the auspices of the Texas Historical

dating from ca. 1250-1500 A.D. Faunal remains collected from the site indicates heavy reliance on
bison hunting, The condition of the bison bone is comminuted with entire elements and articular
ends being rare. This paper investigates possible causes for the quantity of bone breakage such as bone
grease manufacturing, marrow extraction, human trampling and carnivore gnawing. (7)

Marine Food Sources for Coastal Peruvian Camelids: Evidence and Implications.

Combined carbon and nitrogen stable isotopic analysis of collagen from bones of camelids excavated
at Chilca, ranging in age from 950 to 260 years B.P., suggests a considerable proportion of marine
foods in the diets of some individuals, Analysis of seal and deer bones excavated at Chilca indicate
fully marine and terrestial diets respectively, suggesting that post-mortem alteration of bone collagen
isotope ratios has not occurred at these sites. These observations suggest that some prehistoric
camelids lived (and fed) for a considerable proportion of their lives on the coast, which, if true, would
have significant biological and anthropological implications. (42)

Natural Disturbance and Human Response in Evolutionary Reconstruction.

In the last decade, ecologists have recognized that natural disturbance has been a recurrent aspect
of most ecosystems. This has led to a revision of succession theory and new attempts to specify biotic
responses, involving both populations and behavioral ecology. An overview of the ecology of natural
disturbance and response provide a framework useful in hypothesizing past human demographic and
cultural responses to environmental perturbations. More accurate reconstruction of past human
population growth and cultural evolution, including proximate causes of the cybernetic aspects of
these processes, should result. (17)

involved in the city’s demise and the rise to power of new centers, and (2| the processual explanations
of why these events occurred when they did. Teotihuacan’s decline was basically due te complies
focal economic and political factors and can be comprehended by examining the reactions of varius
socio-economic groups to the decline process. El Tajin and Cholula took immediate advantage of the
situation while new foci of political and economic power such as Xochicalco and Tula initiated them

Quantitative Methods in the Study of Inter-Assemblage Variability.

Three general issues important to quantitative studies of variation among chipped and ground stone
assemblages and their implications for understanding the Southwestern Archaic are discussed. These
include: (1) behavioral interpretation—should variability be viewed as “cultural”, temporal, func-
tional, or organizational? (2) archeological methodology—what aspects of variation are relavent (e.g.
assemblage “types” vs. covariation)? What are the effects of factors such as sample size and reoccu~
pation? (3) statistical considerations—which multivariate techniques are best suited and what
assumptions need to be met? Results from two New Mexico surveys are discussed. (38)

Seasonality Analysis of Prehistoric Oyster Utilization in the Upper Chesapeake and Delaware Estu-
aries, Atlantic Coast, Eastern U.S.

Techniques from artificial mariculture of oysters can be used to accurately identify their season of
death. The technique focuses on growth rings on the shells’ hinge area and was applied to shells from
over 30 prehistoric middens on the upper Delmarva Peninsula. Samples ranged in age from ca. 700
B.C. to A.D, 1400. The overwhelming majority of samples were collected in winter and early spring,
Middens also often included stored plant food remains. Oysters, therefore, were consumed only during
seasons of otherwise low food resource productivity and their utilization was probably a consequence,
rather than a cause, of sedentary lifeways. (12)

microwear analysis of level 4a (11,950>190 B.P.) was performed, A typical variety and distribution
of technical types were recovered, yet the microwear analysis indicated a dominance of meat butch-
ering accompanied by substantial hide working activities. A hunting camp and observation post was
proposed a8 the site function for this level. The proposition was tested and supported by the faunal
assemblage. It is suggested that microwear analysis can be another instrument, accompanying faunal

‘analysis, for the interpretation of site function. (57)

This paper reviews the progress that has been made in the application of computer modeling

of computational concepts and techniques available to support modeling. The increasing emphasis
on distributed systems in artificial intelligence studies and in computer science generally promises a
major and relevant enhancement in this repertoire. (9)

is that the organization of human settlement, mobility, and technological systems, as well as the
natural processes that separate the archae,ological record from those systems, must be modeled first
before the mechanisms behind the patterning in the archaeological record can be understood and the
data collection methods used for either explanatory or management purposes devised. (26)

adaptive strategies. (34)

Spatial, Functional, and Social Differentiation in a Tucson Basin Classic Community.

A large site with an adobe mound and multiple compounds is the central focus of a Classic Period
community encompassing over 250 sites and 35 square miles. This community represents demo-
graphic reorganization and contrasts with long term stability in adjacent parts of the region. Total
coverage survey of 130 square miles allows definition of community boundaries and recognition of
topographically and functionally discrete site types within it. Intersite relationships within the
complex are also analyzed by reference to spatial arrangements and variability in size, internal features
and artifact assemblage. (43)

Analyzing Regional Agriculture: A Hohokam Example.

A wide variety of Hohokam agricultural sites and techniques have been recorded in total survey of
over 35 sq.mi., near Tucson, Arizona. Excavated fieldside processing areas, pollen samples from
farming features, and associated artifacts identify corn and agave as important crops. Interpretation
of results illustrate the advantages of full coverage data for understanding agriculture in a regional
context. Distributional analysis enables correlation of land use over time with environmental vari-
ables and habitation patterns. Measured extant and spatial relationships of cultivated loci provide a
basis for assessing production potential, labor requirements, transportation costs, and other aspects
of subsistence and economy. (50)

The Archaeology of British Columbia, 1970-1985.

In the last 15 years almost 200 significant site excavations and the production of more than 1500
major published and unpublished reports have vastly increased the archaeological data base for
virtually all portions of the nearly 1 million square kilometer area of British Columbia. Radiocarbon
dated cultural chronologies are now extended back to 10,000 B.P. or more for both coastal and interior
regions, and major advances haye been made in processual, methodological and resource management
areas. This paper will describe highlights of British Columbia archaeology over the last 15 years, in
an effort to demonstrate the maturing status of provincial prehistory within the overall discipline.

Forager Spatial Ecology: Hierarchical Structure in the Regional Archaeological Record.

Ethnoarchaeology has exposed the structure of the archaeological record at a small spatial and’
temporal scale. In contrast off-site archaeology has shown that at a regional level archaeological
material is ubiquitous and continuously distributed. Future developments in the archaeology and
ecology of foraging populations require the integration of these radically different scales of archaeo-
logical process, This paper uses ecological principles and middle range theory to elucidate the hier-
archical spatial structure of the archaeological record, and discusses the implications for studies of
hunter-gatherer adaptation. The archaeological record of tropical Africa provides the empirical frame-
work, (47)

Belize Valley Maya Settlement Pattern Chronology and the Implications for the Development of the
Central Lowlands.

The Belize River Archaeological Settlement Survey, situated within 60km of the major core area
center of Tikal, provides important comparative chronological and settlement pattern data for deter-
mining economic and political relations between the core area and its peripheries. Residential unit
excavations provide a foundation for examining changes in occupation over time. Comparison of
general environmental characteristics with settlement distributions, composition, and proximity to
centers in the Belize Valley will be contrasted with comparable data from the core area in an effort
to understand the integration of the Central Maya Lowlands. (21)

Shellfish Harvesting and the Available Food Supply.

The effects of predation by human groups upon prey species affect a subsistence system and thus,
its archaeological remains. Virtually aH human activity, including predation, disturbs natural com-
, 78 Ford, R. I.
munities and that disturbance alters the available food source for human populations. On San Juan
Island on the northwest coast of North America, human populations have preyed upon shellfish
within the intertidal zone for well over 600 years. In shellfish, the limits imposed by human predation
include a shortened lifetime and thereby a smaller size range within each taxon. Shells from the
midden on Garrison Bay are used to test the hypothesis that human patterns of shellfish collecting
limited the size distribution of cockles and clams, and that these limitations are evident archaeolog-
ically. (12)

The Conservation Ethic in American Archaeology: An Historical Overview.

Efforts to conserve archaeological resources in North America began in the late 18th Century, but
crystallization of a conservation ethic did not begin until after the Civil War. The development of the
ethic must be seen in the context of the natural resources conservation movement, and the historic
preservation movement in the U.S. In this context, a history of the ethic’s vicissitudes from ca, 1874
to 1974 is presented. (14)

A Formative Period Water Control System at the Amalucan Site, Puebla, Mexico.

The Amalucan site is situated in the Puebla Valley of the Central Mexican Highlands. The majority
of the ca. 300 hectare site area is capped by a humus horizon which is buried under colluvial and
aeolian sediments. Aerial photographic analysis, ground reconnaissance, and a series of excavations
beginning in 1962 have revealed the existence of an extensive water control system dating to the
Formative Period. A model for this system includes two impoundments connected by large parallel
canals with a series of smaller lateral canals in between. Both irrigation and drainage functions for
the system are proposed. Supportive evidence for the model is examined. (28)

Survey in Britain.

Field survey in Britain is conducted within an antiquarian topographical tradition, now best expressed

through analytical methods and sophisticated instrumentation on a project basis. Organizationally,

~ thé range is through institutional variety to individual enterprise with little coordination or stan-

dardization. Categories of site, regional and small areas are favored subjects; finance, land-manage-
‘ ment needs and landscape change often dictate the choice. The field evidence of early farming provides

both a case-study and material important in later prehistoric Europe. It contributes a crucial element

to understanding the evolution of Britain's cultural landscape and allows us to address basic questions

in agrarian history. (15)

Variations in the settlement patterns, artifact assemblages, population densities and agricultural
potentials are examined for the Late Classic Maya rural settlements within the Copan region of
western Honduras, from the Sesesmil drainage system to the Rio Amarillo river basin. The implica-
tions of these differences on the regional sociopolitical organization of the Late Classic Copan area is
discussed, and a model of the regional sociopolitical organization of the Late Classic Copan Maya is

Disjunctive Growth in the Maya Lowlands.
: Studies in the Mexican Highlands show that shifts in settlement distribution, density, and settle-
ment system structure are often the result of shifts in regional political and/or economic centraliza-
: tion. Such studies have demonstrated the importance of adequate reconstruction of the structure of
regional political and economic systems to any attempt at understanding regional demography. This
paper will examine the usefulness of this approach in understanding the demography of the central
and southern Maya Lowlands. Data from the Tikal region and areas of intensive agriculture will be
used in this evaluation. (39)

Are PCs the Answer? A Look at Some Problems and Issues.
The availability of micropocessors and the extension of these into many traditional tasks are having
; a far reaching effect in American archaeology today. The seemingly unending array of personal
computers and software packages have placed computing resources in reach of virtually every archae-
ologist. This powerful technology brings attendant problems and issues which must be carefully
considered. Among the more critical questions to be addressed are: {1} personal computer mainframe
interfaces and software protocols, (2) security issues, both physical equipment and data, and (3} legal
issues in the use of software and databases. Some projections for personal computer future use in an
archaeological environment are offered. (41)

Change in Choctaw Productive Organization During the Eighteenth Century.

The complexity of the interaction between Choctaw and European societies during the 18th century

had a substantial impact upon the modes and organization of traditional Choctaw production. In
: addition to being increasingly linked to the Europeans through trade, the Choctaw were drawn into

the political struggle between the French and British. This involvement not only affected Choctaw

material culture, but also transformed the traditonal subsistence system and the social framework

surrounding production. This paper reviews both the documentary evidence concerning change in

productive organization and the archaeological evidence from 18th century Choctaw sites in Missis-

sippi. (49)

Federal Funding and Middle Atlantic Archaeology.

Federal funding over the past decade in the Middle Atlantic has advanced prehistoric and historic
archaeology. The current situation bears little resemblance to the pre 1970s. It is true there has been
both “good” and ‘bad’ archaeology. At a minimum the sewer lines, the highway, and survey and
planning funds have forced the area’s archaeologists out of the major river stockaded villages and the
tidewater plantations into the streams, mountains, and back roads, and below the plow zone. They
have demonstrated that there is indeed anthropology lurking behind the otherwise dull attributes of
cord marking, side notching, and salt glazing. This paper discusses these developments, how other
factors such as new research orientations inter-relate, and considers some of the less than positive
aspects. {18)

Chromium Chalcedony: The Mesoamerican Emerald.

Chromium chalcedony described first in Rhodesia in 1965 as Mtorolite, was used in Mesoamerica
since the Preclassic. It has been reported at the Middle Motagua Valley and the workshops at San

excavations in the San Agustin Acasaguastlan archaeological zone (Guaytan), worked chromium
chalcedony was found, with signs of advanced lapidary technology (type IV workshop). The emerald
color is given by chromium, and it has fuchsite and cassiterite inclusions. Due to its charactesistics
we postulate that this mineral i5 the Quetzaliztli (Mesoamerican Emerald) described by Sahagun. |28)

Trash Pits and Floor Features; Don’t Believe Everything.

A deep Hohokam trash mound is sampled in 10cm levels in four adjoining areas to test for com-
parability between levels. The analysis produces conflicting results which suggest that a single column
sample from a trash feature will not be representative of deposition. At another Hohokam site, the
macrobotanical contents of pithouse floor features are compared to corresponding fill samples. The
results show a tremendous amount of overlap, indicating that trash has masked the original functions
of the floor features. This critical examination points out the need for more caution in drawing
conclusions about depostion and feature functions. (19)

Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic in Languedoc and East Pyrenees: Continuity and Change.

Closely following classic Upper Paleolithic sequences of the Aquitaine region of France, western
Languedoc and the eastern Pyrenees show typical Magdalenian industries through the Dryas Il in the
Mediterranean geographic zone. The persistence, unchanged, of Magdalenian industries for another
millennium or more during a phase of rapid, postglacial environmental modifications, shows the
independence between technological change on the one hand, and subsistence and environmental
change on the other. The subsistence economy shows the gradual replacement of cold climate by
temperate climate species, fishing activities, and the first evidence of intensive exploitation of wild
legumes and fruits. (52)

Ceramic Exchange in the Kayenta Anasazi Region,

Microscopic examination of several thousand white ware sherds from surface collections of nearly
300 sites reveals that volcanic ash temper occurs in upwards of 75% of the sherds within certain
localities of the Kayenta region from Pueblo I to late Pueblo Ill. Using distributional data, oxidation
experiments and geologic sourcing of both clays and ash, prehistoric production zones of ash tempered
white ware are isolated, The occurrence of this pottery on Kayenta sites outside of the production
zones is then interpreted as resulting from intraregional trade. Some additional implications of these
findings are explored. (11)

Gems and Labor: Displaying Presitge in Stone.

Lithic items have a long history of use as prestige markers. This paper, focusing on the prehistoric
Andean region, documents a shift in the nature of value in prestige lithics. In earlier contexts, value
can be seen to be derived from the scarcity of particular minerals and from displaying control over
trade for such items. In later contexts, value is based on the labor intensity of items produced in stone,
displaying control over the productive energy of skilled craftspersons. The implications of this shift
in value are explored by examining the contexts from which prestige lithic objects are recovered. (49)

role are presented, with special consideration given to the possible importance of the ethnic distinc-

Optimal Foraging in Diachronic Perspective: A Case Study from Interior Alaska.

Application of optimal foraging models is becoming increasingly popular in archaeology. Selection
of optimality models that are insensitive to slight environmental changes is critical in archaeological
applications. Intensive wildlife, botanical, archaeological, ethnographic, fisheries, and paleoenviron-
mental studies have been conducted in the Upper Susitna Basin during the past five years. These data
permit evaluation of the relative sensitivity of cost estimation procedures and optimal foraging models
over a 7,500 year time span in a well-suited undisturbed environment, {37}

Prehistoric Archaeological Survey in Southeast Spain.

Programs of systematic archaeological survey have scarcely been undertaken in Iberia, partly due
to the conservatism of local archaeological practice, partly due to the difficulty of adequately dating
later prehistoric materials from surface collections, and partly due to the difficulty of assessing the
impact of long term soil erosion and recent agricultural modernization on site preservation, The |
strong contrasts in location of known sites between various periods suggests that significant changes
in settlement pattern occurred associated with progressive agricultural intensification. Recent results
of preliminary survey in the Vera Basin illustrate the difficulties and potential of systematically
designed survey. (15)

Changes in Subsistence on Marine Resources through 7000 years of Prehistory on Santa Cruz [sland,

Faunal remains from radiocarbon dated column samples collected from Santa Cruz Island have
been analyzed to reveal broad changes in marine resource exploitation. The data indicate that shellfish
were an important dietary constituent through 7000 years of prehistory, although other food resources
undoubtedly always contributed more to the total annual diet. Sea mammals and fish become increas-
ingly important after ca, 3000 B.P. These changes in marine resource exploitation are argued to be
related to population growth, with environmental change being a significant contributing factor, {59}

Nature of the Pueblo 11 Occupation on Central Black Mesa, Arizona.

Excavation of 27 Kayenta Anasazi sites on central Black Mesa, northeastern Arizona, indicate
occupation of the area from Basketmaker II to late Pueblo III. The Pueblo III period is a little known
period of occupation on Black Mesa and a time at which most of northern Black Mesa had been
abandoned. These late sites are small habitations containing rectangular semi-subterranean struc-
tures. Based on size and material culture, these sites are interpreted as farmsteads occupied by nuclear
families. This contrasts with the prevailing view of Tsegi Phase sites as large masonry habitations
with multiple family occupations. (3) =

The Relationship of Reliance on and Intensity of Agriculture to the Presence of Pottery.

A review of evidence from the archaeological record suppports a relationship between the simultaneous
presence of agriculture and pottery. To examine the relationship which exists between these two
elements, two areas of data are examined: (1) a cross-cultural sample is used to determine correlations
between pottery usage and reliance on and intensity of agriculture; (2) agricultural groups which do
not use pottery are examined as exceptional cases. The conclusions drawn from these areas of evidence
are presented. (11)

Lithic Production for the Future: Quarry Behavior among Early Holocene Hunters-Gatherers in South

The study of chert quarries utilized by highly mobile prehistoric hunter-gatherers is relevant to the
understanding of production which is future oriented, Where critical lithic raw materials have restricted
geographic distributions, the study of core and tool production at the raw material source can be
informative about decisions which had to be anticipated at locations quite removed in time and space.
Core and preform designs from a Paleolndian quarry in South Carolina are analyzed to provide a
baseline to explain assemblage variability away from the source. (49)

Geographical Information Systems and Regional Analysis in Archaeology.

Over the past 15 years, locational analysis has become established as a key area of archaeological
inquiry. With greater emphasis on quantitative regional research, the need for efficiently organized,
computerized data bases grows increasingly important. This paper addresses such issues within the
context of regional research in the Basin of Mexico. Ultimately stressing applications, it begins by
exploring the need for such data structures. Then the design of a regional-ecological GIS for settlement
data is examined with the potential for interfacing with other GIS’s. Examples of spatial studies of
the basin strongly support the need for such data organization. (6)

In Pursuit of the Coal Miner's Daughter: Interpretation of Excavated Features at the Buxton, lowa,
Townsite.

a Iowa, was a town owned by the Consolidation Coal Company between 1900 and 1925.
Blacks predominated among Buxton’s 5000-6000 residents. Today, few vestiges of the well-planned
community remain at the abandoned townsite. Archaeological excavations, following reconnaissance
survey, revealed remains of subsurface features in a former house lot. A linkage of these structures
and associated domestic debris with a specific family is suggested on the basis of archival and
archaeological methods. The evidence points to a coal miner's family whose daughter's birthdate and

Woodland lithic collections from central New York has suggested that historical-descriptive types of
lithic end products such as projectile points until now considered to represent intrusive cultural
groups or elements may have simply resulted from critical functional choices made at differing nodes
in the indigenous shared lower Great Lakes lithic reduction sequence, over this period. (8)

The Tempo and Nature of Evolutionary Change in Contrastive Environments.

The pattern of prehistoric cultural evolution should be explicable in terms of selection for varying
natural and cultural environments. It is hypothesized that variation in critical climatic attributes is
associated with distinctive long term evolutionary patterns. The greater the climatic variation, the
more likely it will be that opportunistic behavioral and organizational changes will be selected for
over the short term and instituted as the dominant arrangement. Stable environments, on the other
hand, condition less rapid or complete selection and will tend to preserve more variation in behavioral
adaptations. This hypothesis is tested on two sets of archaeological! data from the American Southwest
and the Western Pacific, where similar evolutionary trajectories prevailed. (17)

Grayson, Donald K. (Washington, Seattle)
The European Influence on American Archaeology: The Search for Our Earliest Ancestors.

The 1859 recognition of a Pleistocene archaeological record immediately led to reports of Tertiary
artifacts in the Old World and toa competitive search for comparable materials in the New World.
These searches spurred the growth of prehistoric archaeology, but had largely ended by the 1930's
because of difficulties in securely identifying noncomplex subtractive artifacts. After World War Il,
the search began again in North America, but, because of the nature of the archae,ological record,
was not revived in the Old World. Current debates over the results of the North American work are
tellingly parallel to the European debates of 1865-1925. (14)

In a Button: Material Reflections of Early American Culture.

Stylistic analysis of buttons on 18th and 19th century men’s waistcoats and vests seems to confirm
two insights developed by Deetz. First, enlightenment reason and order are reflected in design and
symmetrical arrangement. The canons of style can be traced through tailors’ models to France. Second,
the individual as a distinctive type in the emerging Republic may be reflected in increased variability
in button styles and their increasingly asymmetrical arrangement on vests. Suggestions are offered
for grounding these inferences about ideology in the economic and social contexts in which buttons
and vests were manufactured and used. (40)

Making Contracts Count,

Contract archaeology is viewed from three perspectives: (1) project specific research potentials, (2)
cumulative research opportunities, and |3) academic research interfaces, Results derived from diverse
projects provide examples of how contract archaeology can contribute to our understanding of the
past. Examples illustrate some of the unique and innovative contributions that are possible despite
the constraints of contracts. Contract results may foster insights into regional problems not often
addressed by academic research, given present levels of funding and research interests. Finally, exam-
ples are provided to illustrate how data generated by contract archaeology projects can be interfaced
with academic research objectives. (58)

Forager-Farmer Transitions in Coastal Prehistory: Examples
from the Old and New Worlds,

Archaeologists in Europe and North America hypothesize that understanding resource-rich coastal
societies in prehistory is relevant to the problem of origins and spread of agriculture. Recent work on
Cardial Ware groups in Mediterranean and Atlantic Europe and on Mockley and Colington Phase
groups in Atlantic North America suggests the causal relationships are varied, and often contradictory
on the sur,face. Well-adapted coastal foragers and fishers resisted, sometimes for long periods, the
advent of intensive grain agriculture. Certain artifact types and more “pliable” forms of plant domes-
tication were more readily accepted. (56)

Multi-Stage Survey for Mesolithic and Neolithic Sites in Southeastern Ireland.

The colonization and spread of farming have long been a subject of debate among Irish prehistorians;
one factor is the near complete absence of Mesolithic and Neolithic finds from the southern portion
of the island. The Bally Lough archaeological project is designed to systematically survey the Waterford
estuary area of southeastern Ireland in order to examine this void in the archaeological record. Toward
this end we have begun implementing a multistage research design that includes non-random and
random regional survey strategies, as well as intensive intra-site geophysical survey. To date we have
located over 125 sites ranging in age from the Mesolithic through the Bronze Age. This paper describes
our ongoing survey design and discusses its effectiveness in terms of site discovery and solving
problems concerning Ireland's initial colonization and the subsequent spread of farming. (15)

Quantification and Implications of the Labor and Resource Requirements for the Construction of
Hohokam Platform Mounds.

Recent excavations at Las Colinas, a large Sedentary and Classic period Hohokam village in Phoenix,
Arizona, have provided detailed documentation of the complex construction sequence of Mound 8, a
platform mound. Based on these excavations, estimates of the labor and materials required for the
construction of Mound 8 are presented. These estimates are then applied to other excavated platform
mounds as well as those for which only outside dimensions are available. Comparisons are also made
with the labor requirements for ball courts and canals. The implications of these estimates for an
understanding of Hohokam sociopolitical organization are explored. (43)

Prehistoric Utilization of Thermal Springs in the Pacific Northwest.

The use and importance of thermal springs to native Americans prior to and during the period of
white contact is examined. Ethnographic, archaeological and oral historical information is collected
in an attempt to reconstruct the past use of these springs. This information is examined in relation
to the springs location and tempera, ture in an effort to see what effect hot springs might have had on
the settlement patterns throughout the three culture areas that constitute the Pacific Northwest
(Northwest Coast, Plateau and Northern Great Basin), An analysis of these data is used to form a
temporary assessment of the value of thermal spring sites to our archaeological inventory, (40)

Campsites and Home Bases: Behavioral Correlates and Archaeological Systems Among Humid Trop-
ics Foragers.

« Ethnoarchaeological research among groups of foragers in the Philippines provides indications of
the range of variation in adaptive strategies in various tropical environments as well as a base for
generalizations concerning tropical forest hunters through space and time. One central issue concerns
the ability of the forests to support human populations prior to horticulture. Another focuses on the
relative importance of meat versus plant foods. The behavioral correlates of the ethnographic material
universe help delimitation of archaeologically predictable data, which in turn enable construction of
an improved theory of artifact-human behavior relationships. (47)

Domestic Architecture as an Artifact in the Huanuco Region of Peru.

Prehistoric Andean architecure holds great promise as a data source for such archaeological topics
as social structure, demographics, and spatial analysis. Through the comparison of architectural
remains and early colonial documents which refer specifically to those remains, a greater understand-
ing can be reached of architecture as an artifact and of the Andean village and household as a working
cultural entity in the prehistoric periods. This paper will discuss the use of colonial documents and
field survey of architecture in the Huanuco region of Peru, and the resulting picture of the Late
Horizon household, popula, tion, use of space, and village in the region. (48)

Early Man in Piaui, Brazil.

Man inhabited the area of Sao Raimundo Nonato, southeast of Piaui, Brazil, at least since 30,000
years ago. Since 1978 we have led five seasons of excavation at the site of Toca do Boqucirao do Sitio
da Pedra Furada. The latest occupation levels date from 6160=130 years B.P. and the shelter was
inhabited over a long time period. We have dates for several levels, with the earliest so far Level XIX
at 27,000 and 31,500 years B.P.(Level XIX}, Excavations in 1984 proceeded to Level XXV and in all
levels we found lithic material and charcoal. The implements of the oldest levels were typically flaked
on pebbles. We collected, in the deepest levels, a very important assemblage of lithic material ever
associated with charoal. In this paper we also discuss the evidence of rock art found in association
with fire,hearths. This site is yery important for the study of early man in South America as it is the
oldest actually known in this region. (31)

Modeling of Short Interval Culture and Climatic Change Time Series.

Recent publications provide short interval culture chronologies, phases of a few hundred years.
Culture change, being a product of both cultural and environmental processes, requires reconstruction
of environment at equally brief intervals, The cost of purely empirical reconstruction of high reso-
lution enviro-cultural chronologies is prohibitive, An economical strategy is to model the environ-
mental sequence and empirically test it at critical junctures. A model of southcentral area climate
change constructed from global climate-forcing variables correlates favorably with the Pleistocene-
Holocene culture sequence. (2)

An Adaptive Strategy Model for the Late Prehistoric Period in Southeastern Colorado.

A prehistoric collector adaptive strategy for subsistence and settlement following Binford’s logistical
collector mode] is discussed for the Fort Carson-Pinon Canyon Maneuver Area. The model proposes
the existence of; (1) substantial semi-sedentary residential bases within the canyons, (2) medium field
camps located in the steppes and hills; and (3) small outgrowths of both major site types geared toward
specialized activities, It is argued that residential bases within the canyons were winter occupations,
but potentially habitable all year, whereas field camps and locations reflect seasonal procurement
during the summer and fall. Critical to the logistic model is the recognition of sites which document
premeditated exploration of a major reliable resource. (45)

Field Methods in Archaeology.

A history of the last 50 years of American archaeological technique is presented showing our
original dependence upon European sources both classical and prehistoric. [t is shown that archaeol-
ogists were already firmly committed to stratigraphy in developing chronologies. It is argued that the
greatest single revolutionary event was Federal Relief programs in the 1930s, which enabled large
scale testing of new excavation techniques. The introduction of newer concepts has demanded the
development of newer techniques. Radio-carbon dating is only as good as our method of collectine
specimens. (14]

Frequency of Corn: Towards Assessing the Relative Importance of Horticulture.

A measure of the frequency of corn, expressed as milliliters of carbonized corn fragments per liter
of fine-screened soil sample, may be of value in assessing the relative importance of horticulture in
the subsistence economies of corn producing cultural complexes. Due to numerous cultural variables,
results must be interpreted cautiously and might best be used in conjunction with other analytic
methods. Data from sites in South Dakota are used to illustrate preliminary results of this approach
which indicates an increasing reliance on horticulture from the Plains Woodland to Plains Village
traditions. (19)

Stability in Village-Level Specialization in the Upper Mantaro Valley, Peru: The Organization and

Technology of Production.

Ethnographic observations of pottery manufacture at the local villages of Aco, Concho, Quiche,
and San Luis provide models for prehistoric production. Cost efficiency in specialist production and
consistency in demand are thought to account for stability in the organization of production. Here,
demand is measured by consumption of ceramic products; cost efficiency is measured by the stan-
dardization and labor investment in manufacture. Analysis of prehistoric Wanka ceramics indicates
little change in standardization and cost efficiency from Wanka II and Wanka III, or in fact from
prehistoric to historic times. (10)

Changing Interactions in the Northern Mogollon Region Prior to A.D. 1000.

The degree of interaction between the early Mogollon and adjacent culture areas has been debated
voluminously and in many instances has resulted in the Mogollon being questioned as a distinct
cultural entity. New evidence from two pit house villages located on the White Mountain Apache
Indian Reservation makes possible the examination of interaction issues within a microtemporal
framework. Intrusive ceramics and other data from dated contexts are combined with regional data
to document the changing interaction between the Mogollon, Hohokam, and Anasazi in the Northern

Household Economy and Refuse at Matacapan, Veracruz, Mexico.

Teotihuacan in the Middle Classic exerted a strong economic influence on Matacapan. A dominant
outside economic power will have an effect on the distribution of domestic labor and resources.
Variations in the distribution of domestic refuse in specified contexts are used to define household
economic patterns. Important artifact variables include types and their distribution, density, diversity,

* and attributes resulting from use and discard. Ethnographic and ethnoarchaeological studies show
that household economic patterns are an important influence on household size and structure, which
can be seen in domestic architecture. (40)

Boundary Dynamics Among Prehistoric Hunter-Gatherers in the Eastern United States.

The study of hunter-gatherer regional social organization has become profitably concerned with
variation in territoriality and the spatial scale over which interaction occurs at different organizational
levels (¢.g., task group to information sharing networks). Parallel research on stylistic behavior has
yielded new insights related to processes of boundary formation and the concept of boundedness. The
potential of these lines of research to reveal new information on prehistoric hunter-gatherer adaptation

| has been demonstrated in several areas of the world. This paper presents the initial results of research
on temporal variation in hunter-gatherer spatial adaptations and styl,istic behavior in the eastern
United States. (23)

Evolutionary Thinking in Historical Archaeology: Suggestions from the Industrial Frontier.

Settlement plan standardization is a pattern in which different communities share very similar

standardized plans develop and are maintained. Examples are drawn from the Kayenta Anasazi
sequence of Black Mesa, Arizona. This sequence exemplifies a regional trend involving the appearance
of small settlements with standardized arrangements of facilities related to basic subsistence (food
processing and storage), domiciliary, and community integrative activities. Aspects of this standard-
ized settlement plan are explained in terms of efficiency in facility location, design, construction, and
use. (24)

Agroecology and Geopolitics: An Analysis of Iroquoian Settlement Change Through GIS Techniques.
The evolution of Iroquoian culture coincided with the development of warfare, tribalization, and

scale, through geographical correlates such as agricultural potential or proximity to trade routes.

Though many such variables have been suggested as having influenced change, none have yet been

tested rigorously against a body of settlement data. Here, proto-Iroquoian site distributions in New

York are examined in a geographical context. GIS methods are used to test hypotheses regarding

geopolitical and agroecological influences on settlement behavior during the Late Woodland Period.

Archaeobotanical Remains: Interpretive Problems Concerning Production and Consumption.

Traditionally, prehistoric plant remains from archaeological sites have been used to determine the
range of plant foodstuffs consumed by the inhabitants. Today, paleoethnobotanists are interested in
using such plant remains to address economic and ecological questions. More systematic scrutiny of
the data has shown that plant distributions better reflect actual production. Only in certain specific
situations do botanical remains reflect actual plant consumption. Assumptions underlying interpre-
tations of plant remains and their distribution will be discussed.(53}

The Role of Salmon in the Upper Paleolithic of Southwest France. |
There are two competing constructions of the economy and population levels for the Upper Paleo-

can provide subsistence abundance and stability, tests were carried out to determine the importance

of seafoods in the Upper Paleolithic using carbon isotope ratios in human, animal, and salmon bones.

In other areas of the world such as the Northwest Coast, highly sophisticated art traditions are

associated with economies of abundance, and results of this research may indicate that the same was

true of the European Upper Paleolithic. (4)

Ecology, Ethnicity and Interaction in the Western Arctic,

Determining whether formal variation in artifact types indicates ethnicity, or the operation of local
ecology, depends foremost on accurate identification of the “stylistic” and the “functional aspects
of assemblages. This task is usually complicated by the difficulty of objectively isolating the stylistic
aspects in the limited remnants of simple societies. Behavioral interpretation of the causes for
variability in material culture patterns is thereby jeopardized. Here, however, the diverse content and
classificatory reliability of collections representing the Western Thule of Arctic Alaska provided an
excellent opportunity to examine the interplay of ecology, ethnicity and regional interaction in
forming material culture patterns. (23)

Chronological Contamination in Stratified Archaeological Sites.

A problem affecting the analysis of materials recovered from Middle Eastern tells is the intrusion
of artifacts from earlier contexts into later deposits. A step toward resolving this problem is the
discovery of criteria capable of distinguishing primary in situ from secondarily deposited remains.
Two methods related to bone remains are suggested. One assumes that redeposited material suffers
additional exposure to taphonomic processses resulting in higher relative survival of resistant skeletal
elements. The second argues that in undisturbed deposits percentages of sand-sized bone fragments
are proportional to the amount of large bone, whereas in disturbed situations the relationship 1s
unpatterned. (55)

Writing the History of American Archaeology.

Histories of archaeology are divisible into several overlapping types and approaches. Generally
speaking, however, the history of archaeology has swung between the poles of memoir-biography and
general history. With some exceptions, lacking thus far has been consideration of the social and
institutional matrix of archaeology. For example, focus on individual motivation and achievement |
has blurred the extent to which patrons and institutions have influenced the direction of questioning
and exploration. More generally, it is worth asking whether the traditional porousness of archaeol-
ogy—the repeated difficulty of drawing clear lines between professional and amateur—has created a
discipline that enjoys unusual! public support but by the same token is vulnerable to esoteric influ-
ences. Boundary demarcation thus emerges as a central theme of the history of archaeology, reflected
in memoir, biography, and general history alike. (14)

Hunter-Gatherer Mortuary Variability: The Impact of Mobility.

Most archaeological mortuary studies rely on a model using age, sex, and status as the essential
explanatory elements. Investigations of hunter-gatherer mortuary behavior, however, need to consider
the influence of mobility and variations in group organization when interpreting burial variability.
Instances are documented among hunter-gatherers where mortuary practices are not explicable simply

| in terms of age, sex, and status. This study confronts the interpretation of hunter-gatherer burials
using a model which emphasizes mobility rather than relying on models designed for sedentary
groups, and relates patterning in hunter-gatherer mortuary activity to areas of general anthropological
Interest such as group organization. (36)

Foragers to Farmers: The Adoption of Agriculture in the Northern Southwest.

Since the late 1960s, ethnographic studies of hunter-gatherers have Jed to a belated appreciation of
this lifeway as a stable and successful long-term adaptation, in which mobility is a critical factor.
Thus it seems unlikely that agriculture would be readily adopted by hunter-gatherers in the absence
of some compelling factor. Given these considerations, the introduction of agriculture in the South-
west is perhaps best viewed as a response to the disruption of a previously successful hunting-and-
gathering adaptation. This paper examines two factors that might have been responsible for that
disruption—environmental change and population growth—using data on late Archaic and Basket-
makeer II settlement systems from the Four Comers region. (38)

The Cultural Structuring of Technology: Copper Alloys in Ancient West Mexico.

Technological investigations of ancient West Mexican metallurgy indicate that two kinds of bronze-
copper-tin and copper-arsenic were known. Tin and arsenic alloyed with copper hardens it. Many
indigenous metallurgies have used these alloys for tools. The West Mexican peoples, however, used
these two alloys for another property: for their color, which is golden in high tin bronze and silyery
in high arsenic bronze. Objects fashioned from these alloys symbolically convey power and prestige
through form and color; they include large ceremonial tweezers, neck omaments and bells. Ideological
concerns determined that color was the basic property around which this aspect of the metallurgy
developed. The cultural selection of properties exemplifies the cultural structuring of technology at
the most fundamental level. (16)

The Lehi Canal System: Organization of a Classic Period Irrigation Community.

With the completion of the Rowley Project at Park of the Canals, excavation data from a series of
site types along the Classic period Lehi canal system are available for examining variability within a
single irrigation community. Inter-site interaction and variability can now be characterized in terms
of primary group composition, community patterns, status roles as reflected by mortuary assemblages
and access to non-local exchange items. The irrigation community model of sociopolitical organiza-
tion, suggesting the development of site hierarchies, production centers and exchange networks on
localized canal systems is discussed. (43)

Xishuidong, Early Paleolithic Cave Home Site From Central China.

Evidence of fire-using has been proven to exist at Xihoudu, North China; Yuanmou, South China;
Lantian Man Site, Central China; and the famous Beijing Man Site, North China. But more solid
evidence has been found recently from Xishuidong Cave Site. An ash layer, containing charcoal, burnt
bones, fire-cracked rocks and burnt clay, has been tested chemically, The results indicates that the

1.6 meter thick ash layer was accumulated by repetitive occupancy of Early Paleolithic hunters. Lithic

assemblages include scrapers, points, choppers and bola stones. Faunal assemblages are dominated by

subtropic species and few carnivores. Most bones are heavily broken and burnt, All evidence indicates
the Xishuidong site may have been used by Early Paleolithic (800,000-980,000 B.P,) hunters as a home

base. (47)

New Light on the Late Arachaic Period of the Southern Southwest.

Recent excavations at three preceramic, Late Archaic sites in southeastern Arizona suggest that
current views of the general Late Archaic subsistence-settlement system are in need of revision. Two
deeply buried sites tested in the Cienega Valley demonstrate that pithouse villages of substantial size,
complexity, and longevity, apparently dependent to a significant extent upon agriculture, are present
by 2100-2300 B.P, Pithouses, storage pits, roasting pits, hearths, and burials are common features at

& these sites. Further, work at a site in the Tucson Basin has shown that agriculture, pithouses, and

storage features may be present 4 few hundred years earlier. (40)

Identification and Analysis of Faunal Remains: Short Cuts and Short Comings.

Like most shell middens, the Ozette Village Site yielded more faunal remains than could be
identified and classified in detail, The different identification methods that were used are compared
for economy and data yield: {1) simple identification of all elements (record: element, fragment,
species}; (2) simple identification of a sample of all elements; (3) streamlined identification of all
elements (record: species); (4) intensive identification of only the most sensitive elements (record:
element, fragment, s¢x, age). All “short cuts’’ reduce the data available for analysis. Analysts must
select methods compatible wtih their research requirements. (12)

Social Complexity and Hawaiian Prehistory: Is an Evolutionary Understanding Possible?

The islands of Polynesia have long been the focus of research and speculation on the evolution of
social complexity. Hawaii, in particular, was the scene of highly structured and complex social and
political organization by the time of European contact, While Hawaii has received the greatest
attention, most treatments reflect a pre-scientific Spencenan concept of cultural change. Such accounts
draw on synchronic comparisons, are necessarily directional, teleological, transformational and typo-
logical. Distinguishing material-determinist and functionalist models from historical explanations
will be crucial in exploring a Darwinian paradigm for the evolution of social complexity. (17)

Archaeological Units and Human Activities in the Southwest Archaic,

The Southwest Archaic record, reflecting long-term occupation by all mobile groups, provides a
crucial conceptual and methodologic dilemma for archaeologists. At the heart of this dilemma is the
relation between this record and the traditional concept of the archaeological site. An approach focused
on the spatial distribution of individual artifacts in their macro- and micro-environmental contexts
is seen as the best solution to the problem. Rather than focusing on the “'site’’, the archaeological
record is simply seen as the result of a spatially patterned system of behavior which produced an
identifiable body of artifacts and features reflecting the specific activities involved, (26)

Formative Structures From Nueva Era, Tulipe, Ecuador.
Recent excavations at the Formative Period site of Nueva Era, Tulipe, Ecuador, have produced
5 evidence suggesting a period of volcanic activity in the northern Andes which caused the abandonment
of Formative Period sites in the montana and sierra. Defined in the excavations were a number of
; partial structure floors with associated floor refuse and hearths. Comparison of archaeobotanical and
lithic material recovered from the Middle to Late Formative occupation in the valley suggests a major
shift in economic focus away from a mixed economy based on root crops with green corn as a dietary
supplement, to a highly productive maize economy. Coupled with this change in economic focus is
a change in the area's involvement in the long distance trade of obsidian, (48)

The Absence of the Household in the Huari Archaeological Record.
The architectural record from the city of Huari, its provincial administrative centers, and rural

households. It is argued that such units are not represented. The distribution of remains from domestic
as well as craft activities does not support the existence of a household mode of production either.
Ethnohistoric and ethnographic information is presented that raises significant doubt concerning the
importance of the household as the basic unit of production in the Central Andes. (48)

Prehistoric Hunting-Gathering Societies and Sedentism in the Archaeological Record.

With increasing frequency, Middle and early Late Holocene archaeological sites in the midwestern
and southeastern United States are being interpreted as evidence for relatively sedentary hunting-
gathering settlement systems. Archaeological criteria for the identification of settlement permanency

and year-round occupation versus repeatedly reoccupied locations remain problematical. The meth-
odological and theoretical issues surrounding the determination of sedentism in the archaeological
record are examined in reference to the Poverty Point Culture (1500-500 B.C.) in the Lower Mississippi
Valley. A case study using faunal and other archaeological remains from the J. W. Copes site is
presented. (34)

Some Interpretations of Contextual Data From the Tabun Cave, Israel.

In the recent excavations of Lower and Middle Paleolithic levels at Tabun a considerable amount
of information on the position and attitude of lithic artifacts was recorded. An examination of these
data and their relationships to other kinds of information obtained from the collections shows some
interesting regularities that may be more widely applicable in distinguishing natural and cultural
factors that contribute to the final position of lithic materials during site formation. (55)

Late Paleolithic Hunting Strategies in Northeast China.

The main purpose of this paper is to study lifeways of Late Paleolithic hunters in Tunpei, northeast
China. Our samples include five cave sites and seven open-air sites. Bone tools are mainly made of
Jong bones of mammoth, wild horse, and bison, Both breakage and cut mark patterns on faunal
remains indicate meat was the main diet. We believe this partly because periglacial environments are
less productive in food resources. Lithic assemblages suggest that either chasing or corraling were the
dominant hunting techniques. (47)

Late Pleistocene Refugia in Europe.

The dramatic environmental changes of the Late Pleistocene affected various parts of Europe in
different ways. By adopting a wide regional perspective it is possible to examine the spatial patterns
of these variations and to assess their implications for Palaeolithic populations. North-central Europe
experienced the most pronounced fluctuations of climate and was virtually uninhabited during the
last glacial maximum. This paper examines the possibility of population movements out of this region
into refugia during periods of climatic deterioration and investigates the effects of such movements
on cultural developments. (4)

Close-Range/Terrestrial Photogrammetry: A Unique Mensuration Technique for Archaeology.

Close-range/Terrestrial Photogrammetry is an acccurate, fast, economically practical mensuration
technique that can be applied to anything which can be photographed. For archaeology and anthro-
pology this can include sites, features, artifacts, extant villages, agriculture systems, resource areas,
roadway networks, the human body, animals, dentition, etc. The imagery acquired serves two pur-
poses: (1) achieved, it becomes both a visual record and a data base bank for future use; (2) compiled,
it provides very accurate three dimensional measurmements of the subject. Current research and
results in the use of this technique in archaeology will be presented and discussed by the authors,
along with potential applications. (2)

Comparison of Thermoluminescence Dates with Radiocarbon Dates by Beta Counting and Acceler-
ator Techniques.

Sherds can be dated by four independent methods: C14 beta counting, accelerator measurements
on carbon traces within the sherd, thermo-luminescence, and stylistic form. Age analyses of materials
from several sites are shown in this work. Each technique has its own frequently encountered non-
laboratory sources of error. This is particularly serious in situations where there is a paucity of
material and little stratigraphic control. A combination of at least two independent techniques,
particularly C14 and TL, is indispensible for the highest level of confidence. (46)

Spatial and Temporal Variations in Grand Canyon Subsistence and Technology.

Data from recent test excavations of five stratified sites along the Colorado River in the Grand
Canyon are used to study changes in subsistence and technology through times. The sheltered midden
sites span 130 river miles on both the left and right banks, and encompass preceramic through historic
occupations. Analyses of flotation, pollen and macrofossil samples show excellent preservation of
materials from several canyon microenvironments. Variations in lithic and ceramic technologies
relate these specific environments to a seasonal round of activities and to the interaction of the
inhabitants with adjacent groups. (3)

Hunters or Scavengers? Evolutionary Theory as a Tool for Identifying and Explaining Prehistoric
Behavior.

The use of evolutionary theory to predict human or hominid behavior under given environmental
circumstances enables behavioral hypotheses to be tested archaeologically. This approach is in many
ways superior to the usual procedure of “reconstructing” past behaviors from archaeological data
because the data are often too sparse to permit complete or compelling behavioral “reconstruction”.

: Evolutionary ecology is used in generating the hypothesis that small animal hunting should have
been a more common behavior than scavenging for early hominids at Olduvai Gorge. Tests of the
hypothesis yield a more robust explanation for the archaeological record than have traditional ''recon-

' structions”. |17)

Culturally Versus Naturally Deposited Bones: Explorations in Small-Animal Taphonomy.

Archaeologists have long recognized that non-human agents such as predators and collectors can
contribute small-animal bones to archaeological sites, but little research aimed at distinguishing
bones deposited by humans from ones deposited by non-human agents has been conducted. Compar-
ative analysis of damage to small-animal bones recovered from archaeological hearth debris, burrow
deaths, and modern coyote scats, woodrat houses, and owl pellets from great Basin sites is presented.

Results suggest that accumulating agents may be recognized by distinctive bone-damage pattems.
Suggestions are offered for developing a method to aid interpretation of small-animal remains in
archaeological contexts. (7)

Small Site Economic Integration Among the Sinagua.

In the summer of 1984, Grinnell College conducted the first season of excavation at Na 17,957, a
small Padre-Elden Phase village of approximately 10 masonry rooms and a dozen pithouses. Prelim-
inary analyses show that despite its unimpressive size, NA 17,957 was involved in manufacturing
argillite, turquoise, and malachite ornaments. This suggests the possibility of craft specialization
supplementing subsistence agriculture, and involving small sites in widespread exchange networks
which included such local centers as Winona Village and Ridge Ruin. Further investigations are
planned to help clarify the role of small sites in the Sinagua regional economic system. (40)

Agricultural Field Systems in the Salado Basin, Northern Chile.

Agricultural terraces are one of the most widespread landscape features of the arid and semi-arid
tropical and subtropical regions of the Andes. In northern Chile terrace cultivation is the main method
of agricultural production in the Andean piedmont (2,500-4,000m. above sea-level). Today most of
these terraces lie abandoned and very little is known about past agricultural practices and economy
in the area and their implications for achaeology and rural development. Recent research at Paniri
(Late Intermediate) and other archaeological sites in the Rio Salado basin (with special emphasis on
soil studies) illustrates the diversity and complexity of agricultural systems in an arid environment.

Lithic ‘Economy’ and Style: Some Magdalenian Examples.

The results of microwear and related analyses on artifacts from three Magdalenian sites—one in
Northern France and two in Northern Spain, representing what are supposed to be two regional facies

; of the Magdalenian—are discussed. The material analyzed from all three sites dates between 15,000-
13,000 B.P. Two sites give evidence of being specialized hunting stations while one appears to represent
a less specialized and more intense occupation. The comparison of these sites indicates that some of
their similarities are related to common patterns of tool manufacture and use, while their "stylistic"
differences are related to the size and quality of available lithic raw material. (57)

Technology and Hunter-Gatherer Mobility: A Method

It is clear that mobility is an important aspect of hunter-gatherer adaptation. We now face the
problem of inferring different types of mobility strategies from archaeological remains. One inferential
procedure is discussed in this paper which examines the relationship between lithic technologies, the
inherent characteristics of lithic raw material, and the nature of different types of mobility strategies,
It is suggested that mobility strategies can be inferred from regional archaeological patterns given: (1)
knowledge of the raw materials’ characteristics, (2) reconstruction of the technologies used at a site
and (3) a knowledge of site reoccupation. The method is demon,strated on material from the Carson
Sink, Nevada. (47)

identified a probable locus of secondary trimming and final finishing activities involving local cherts
as well as obsidian preforms. Both soft hammer percussion and pressure techniques appear to be
represented by waste material concentrated on the northeast edge of a large open plaza on the center's
east side. The nature, extent, and probable chronology of the workshop is described. The relationship
of this finishing station to several loci of apparent primary lithic reduction at a nearby site is discussed.

Theory and Truth in Archaeology: The Search Continues.

There are archaeologists who believe that theory must equal cruth, which then conditions individ-
uals’ philosophical and theoretical orientations. The relationship between these two concepts is
explored from historical and contemporary contexts, and viewed within the framework of intrasite
spatial analyses. The current dissatisfaction in the general field of archaeology (as espoused by
Flannéry, Dunnell, etc.) is discussed. The future of archaeological theory need not be as bleak as some
believe, and instead is potentially bright, once we recognize and deal with these problems, thereby
allowing archaeologists to again devote themselves fully to the study of the past and, most importantly,
to the processes that shaped it. (2)

Infield Gardening Practices in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas: Building a Foundation for Archaeological
Inference.

Infield gardening practices in the Sierra de los Tuxtlas, Veracruz, Mexico, constitute one component
of the overall system of agriculture practiced by the contemporary peasant population. Horticultural
activities around the place of residence condition the location of access routes, determine where
animals are penned, and form an envelope around other areas of small scale industrial activity and
storage. Activities conducted within dooryard garden borders result in a distinctive pattern of refuse
disposal and dooryard maintenance. Interview, observation, and surface excavations at modern house-
holds show that the organization of domestic and gardening activities can be related to distinctive
patterns of material residue. Dooryard gardening is a common feature of tropical living today as well
as in the past. This research provides a foundation for inferences by archaeologists concerning the
interpretation of prehistoric settlement in the humid tropics. (28)

A Considertion of the Role of Quantitative Archaeology in Theory Construction.

One of the less discussed aspects of quantitative archaeology is its relation to theory. It appears
that higher priority is given to the selection of the “best solution” to a problem. Consequently, the
, | Kissellburg, JoAnn E. 99
relevance of the linkage among problem definition, its arguable resolution, and the method chosen
to measure relationships in the empirical domain is reduced to secondary importance. This resulted
in two approaches: (1) best solution—criticism and replacement of prior techniques with new ones,

justified on statistical grounds, (2) pattern recognition—employment of statistical procedures to detect
patterns, which are held to exist external to the analyst's mind. In terms of relevance to theory, both
are undefendable because of the implicit assumption that “best solutions” exist independent of theory,
Possible resolutions of this problem are explored in this paper. (9)

| Surveying the Ancient Maya Settlement at Colha, Belize, 1983-1984.

Recent exploration and mapping at the lithic production center of Colha has yielded information
on site boundaries as well as intra-site spatial arrangements, Special structural configurations and
activity areas have been tentatively identified, and features such as linear ridges and aguadas recorded.
Whereas the ridges show variation in associations that suggest a range of possible functions, the
numerous aguadas or waterholes dotting the landscape appear to have served as reservoirs for the
surrounding, loosely-agglutinated settlement. Preliminary evidence indicates that these aguadas were

| prehistoric constructions designed to retain rainwater because local groundwater is brackish. (54)

Southeastern Middle Woodland Earspools of the Hopewell Period.

Seventy copper earspools from 25 Middle Woodland sites in the southeastern United States are
analyzed for their morphological variation and technology. The position of various morphological and

| technological attributes within an attribute hierarchy for the éarspools, as well as the behavioral
meanings of those attributes, are assigned deductively on the basis of their visibility and position

| within a manufacturing sequence. The assignments of meaning of attributes then are tested on the
basis of the geographic distributions of alternative attribute states, The analysis gives insight into the
nature of “Hopewell Interaction” during the Middle Woodland. {16}

Quantitative Approaches Well-Suited to Archaeological Problems.

Archaeologists must untangle the multiplicity of factors involved in the creation of the archaeo-
logical record. However, the ability of quantitative techniques to assist these efforts is confounded
by ill-behaved distributions of relevant variables, widely ranging sample sizes, and the need to take
imto account our knowledge, however limited, of the contexts being analyzed. This paper examines
the nature and role of techniques designed to solve archaeological problems and other approaches,
such as simulation and exploratory data analysis, that seem particularly well-suited to large classes
of archaeological problems. (9)

Divergent Evolution in Polynesia.

The Polynesian societies, demonstrably derived from a common ancestral society over a period of
3,000 years, offer an unparalleled opportunity for the study of divergent evolution. In this paper a
tripartite method for the analysis of divergent evolution in Polynesia is discussed including: (1)
controlled ethnographic comparison, (2) lexical recon,struction, and (3) archaeological investigation.
The paper also focuses on several of the dominant processes underlying divergent evolution in
Polynesia, including random ‘drift’, adaptation to diverse and changing environments, demographic
change, production intensifica,tion, and competition. (17)

The Rise of Social Complexity at Pella, Jordan.

As a society's political institutions and economic mechanism grow more complex, certain inter-
related phenomena tend to occur: intensification of local production; social stratification; centrali-
zation and control over basic resources; participation in interregional exchange systems. Excavations
at Pella in Jordan over the past six years have revealed evidence of an impressive Bronze Age culture,
evidenced by high quality, locally produced goods and “luxury” items imported from the Aegean,
Cyprus, and Egypt. Pella’s role as a center for local trade, and external demand for products available
may have spurred local elites to formalize the internal and external organization of trade; and positive
feedback from the expanded production system coupled with entry into an international exchange
network [the eastern Mediterranean) help to explain the growth of complex, stratified society at Pella.

Archaeological Investigations of Intensive Ceramic Production: A Recent Discovery at Comoapan,
Veracruz, Mexico.

The effect of large scale production on the development of complex societies has been much debated
in archaeology in recent years. The recent archaeological discovery of an intensive preHispanic
ceramic production area, containing 34 kilns in 3.5 hectares, represents an unprecedented research
opportunity. Spatial and contextual analyses are presented to elucidate two areas of concern in
archaeological interpretation; (1) criteria for the identification of areas of intensive ceramic production,
and (2) internal structure of kilns and kiln areas, which have implications for the organization of
production. (27]

Pragmatics and Meaning for the Archaeological Record.

One historically lingering problem in archaeology concerns the assignment of meaning to archae-
ological materials. However overworked this may seem, writings explicit upon the problem remain
less than proportionate to its importance. Taking to heart Binford’s (Meaning, Inference, and Material
Record”, 1982) apprehensions regarding suppositions about prehistoric peoples’ cognitive activities,
this paper takes steps toward an explicitly archaeological theory of meaning. It is argued that, without
resorting to a linguistic analogy, a pragmatic theory built on use-conditions can make congruent our
statements about the archaeclogical record, and the perceived techno, logical and ecological contexts
of past cultural systems. (2)

Isotopic Evidence for Southern California Paleoenvironment During the Little Ice Age.

The 180 record in Mytilus californianus shells from a C14 dated Late Prehistoric coastal archaeo-
logical site in southern California suggests ocean surface water temperatures 30C cooler during the
Little Ice Age than surface temperatures recorded today. Causes of this colder climatic regime are
briefly explored. Lower summer and winter air temperatures and reduced precipitation are inferred
from the ocean paleotemperature estimates, but these conditions do not indicate any significant
negative impact on the subsistence activities of coastal Southern California prehistoric hunters and

Geophysical Surveying at Hunter-Gatherer Sites: The Bugas Holding Example.

| Geophysical surveying techniques are rarely used in hunter-gatherer archaeology, yet in a few cases
their effectiveness has been demonstrated, Before excavating the Bugas Holding site was intensively
suryeyed with a magnetometer and a resistivity meter, Numerous anomalies were present, a few of
which were in the area that was later excavated. Distributional patterns of the anomalies from the
two geophysical methods are compared. These are further compared with the excavated material. On
the basis of these patterns we suggest additional magnetometer and resistivity surveying as a poten-
tially productive method for defining several aspects of the archaeological record and its context at
the site. Further, we suggest that geophysical surveying of northwestern Plains and hunter-gatherer
sites should become more common, joining the tradition of Plains village and historic site studies,
where these techniques are frequently used. (46)

and laboratory equipment. Archaeologists from NMSU and UNM have used that equipment in a
variety of field and teaching situations. Experience with the following devices is summarized: laser
fansit, proton magnetometer, digital calipers, digital balances, bar-code reader, portable ‘‘notebook-
size" computers. The advantages and disadvantages of these technologies and systems integrating
them is explored, (41)

and minimum vessel counts are used to reconstruct pottery sequences for the drainage, and to test
the utility of the Smith-Rouse typology currently used by workers in southern New England and New

A Late Valdivia Domestic Household at Real Alto and Its Role in the Production Process.

It has been convincingly argued that a social transformation from egalitarian to chiefdom level
society occurred at Real Alto, southwest coastal Ecuador, between 3000 and 1500 B.C. By Valdivia
VII times, a reduction in the on-site population and corresponding establishment of surrounding
satellite communities engaged in fulltime food production, indicates Real Alto’s function as a central
place ceremonial center. Focussing on a Valdivia VII period structure at Real Alto, the correlation
between artifact dispersion and contextual data is examined in an attempt to infer household activity

patterning and, thus, reconstruct domestic production and its relation to the overall production
process, The degree to which an increase in sociopolitical complelxity is reflected at the household
level is demonstrated. (48)

Trace Element Analysis of Ceramics as a Means of Studying Late Woodland Interaction Systems in
New York State.

This study attempts to examine interaction pattems by identifying foreign ceramic sherds using
trace element analysis. Ceramics from a series of Late Woodland sites in New York State were used
as control samples for establishing regional differences in the trace element composition of clay
resources. Ceramic pipe fragments were then analyzed in an attempt to identify foreign pipes in
village assemblages. The results indicate that a substantial proportion of pipe fragments were man-
ufactured using clay from outside the region, It is suggested that these artifacts may have represented
preferred trade or gift items. The results of this study indicate that interaction between villages during
the Late Woodland Period in New York may have been much greater than previously proposed. (40)

The Fundamentals and Potential of Geographic Information Systems Techniques for Archaeological

Spatial Research.

GIS techniques offer great potential for investigating spatially distributed phenomena. Basic con-
cepts, beginning with the construction of primary data base “layers such as an elevation surface and
hydrology net, are illustrated. From these, secondary analytical surfaces such as slope and aspect, or
various water distance surfaces, may be derived. One benefit of GIS is its ability to derive spatial
information that was previously impossible to obtain due to sheer number of calculations. Various
measures of view, shelter, terrain roughness, and least-effort travel distances illustrate this property.
A second benefit is graphic capabilities. Mapping routines allow the portrayal of information prévi-
ously unimagined in traditional cartography. (6)

proposed. These include specialized features found through time at the site including a platform
sound, ball courts, and a big house. In addition, site location with respect to resource zones, hydraulic
systems, and other sites in the valley is discussed. These data support the hypothesis that Pueblo

The Systematic Identification of Stone from Archaeological Sites.

Several fundamental problems exist in regard to the criteria by which archaeologists hand-identify
lsthic materials. The problems stem from common use of folk taxonomies in both field and laboratory.
Such folk classifications often lack consensus, and the ideas on which they are based are inconsistent
with current petrological practice. A more coherent system of classification, derived from wellesta-
blished standards in petrology, is presented as a means of improving rock identifications. Using
specific examples from Utah, criteria are given for several problematical types (chert, chalcedony,
basalt, etc.). It is emphasized that agreement on basic concepts must precede higher-level analyses.

interethnic Conflict and Iron Smelting in Pastoralist East Africa.

Among precolonial East African pastoralists, interethnic warfare determined where iron smelting,
stationary activity, could be safely performed. The location of furnace remains suggests the changing

archaeological finds, Eighteenth and early 19th century blacksmiths smelted on high mountain ridges
where they remained inaccessible to raids. As inter-group conflicts diminished during the initial
period of colonial rule, smelting moved to canyon mouths. They now work in totally accessible
locations associated with a developed infrastructure. (56)

Surface Distributions and Chronological Control.

When archaeological sites cannot be dated by independent methods (C14, archacomagnetometry),
archaeologists depend on temporally diagnostic artifacts or assemblages for chronological control. If
“diagnostics” are not present, sites are often judged insignificant, Yet single episode use of places by
prehistoric peoples is difficult to identify, even with well-controlled dates. Indeed, surface and sub-
surface assemblages are likely to be chronologically (and perhaps functionally) mixed. Under these
circumstances, what does ‘chronological control” {or lack thereof) mean? What are its implications
for understanding the formation of the archaeological record? Surface artifact distributions from
southwestern Wyoming are used to explore these questions, (26)

conditions began. The Bolling and expecially the Allerod oscillaltions were very marked in this region,
whereas the intervening Dryas II cold episode was short and of slight intensity. In the context of this
climatic trend toward full interglacial conditions, Dryas [il represented a notably abrupt, brutal
climatic crisis, It was under these changing and strongly contrasted environmental conditions that
the “Azilianization” process took place, leading on a regional scale to the end of the Paleolithic and

Perspectives on the Development of Historical Archaeology on the Great Plains.

Historical archaeology on the Great Plains dates from the early 19th century and is somewhat
unique in North America in that it traces its origins to anthropology rather than history. This

Late Puebloan Subsistence Diversification: A Product of Sample Size Effects.

Recently a number of researchers have made a convincing case for the use of a greater number of
plant and animal species, or diversification, by late Puebloan peoples of the American Southwest.
Diversification is regarded as the subsistence strategy utilized preceding abandonment. It is seen,
variously, as being the expected consequence of increased agricultural production, decreasing agri-
cultural or wild plant productivity, environmental deterioration, and/or social stresses. This paper
examines the effects of sample sizes on diversity values used to establish the trend for diversification,
It concludes that sample size effects explain this apparent trend. (3)

Nouveau Riche Archaeology.

Although contract archaeologists now have the bulk of our discipline’s funds at their disposal, they
seem to be the declasse Rodney Dangerfields of the profession—they "don’t get no respect.” We
document the sources and types of complaints that have been leveled at contract archaeology, con-
cluding that poor research is the most serious accusation. Some have argued that cultural resource
management (CRM) is not intended to be research. We counterargue that CRM should be the acronym
for cultural research management and then we explore obstacles to be overcome in managing effective
research within a contract framework. The paper introduces a symposium in which contract archae-
ologists working in central and southern Arizona offer the fruits of their scholarship for critical review

« and evaluation. (58)

Cultural Responses to Late Prehistoric Climatic Changes on the Southern High Plains of North
America.

Intensification of xeric conditions between the 13th and 15th centuries on the southern High Plains
adversely impacted the economic base of the indigenous Plains Village adaptations. In response, a
series of buffering mechanisms were implemented to alleviate population stress and retain the village
pattern. These efforts nevertheless engendered significant changes in the cultural pattern as reflected
by a breakdown in social cohesion, shifts in settlement pattems toward lateral tributaries, expansion
of trade networks, and the development of raiding behavior. Evidence of these changes are provided
by recent research of Antelope Creek phase sites in the Texas panhandle. (45)

A General Model of Culture Stability and Change.

A theoretical cultural system model was developed to guide investigation of change in the Dolores
Anasazi cultural system, A.D. 600-980, Targeted variables are population, resource supply and cost,
social organization, facilities, and technology. Key assumptions are: (1) economic goals are satisficing
rather than maximizing and (2) economic decisions follow a least-cost principle. Agricultural inten-

sification and increased social complexity are seen as responses to stress when lower-cost solutions
to adaptive or social problems are constrained. Under exploration as a possible alternative is a “power"’
or “growth” model, which assumes some maximization, and implies that growth is most likely when
adaptive stress is low. (44)

Canoe Travel Times on Inland Waterways in the Northeast.

Explorers’ reports of the 17th and 18th centuries give travel times by canoe on waterways in the
Northeast. These data show that sites as far apart as Cahokia, Illinois, and proto-Iroquoia lie within
the limits of economic canoe transport defined by Robert Drennan in 1984. Origins of archaeological
finds from southern Ontario indicate substantial long distance travel or exchange 1000 B.C.-A.D. 400,
and again A.D. 1540-1650. Therefore, the paucity of exotic goods in Southern Ontario during the
Mississippian florescence (A.D. 900-1400) requires explanation, (46)

Modeling Paleoenvironments and Culture Change in the Lower Kansas River Basin.

Data used to model prehistoric man-land relationships for the study area include: (1) an alluvial fill
sequence, (2) mid-19th century GLO maps of pre-settlement prairie-woodland ecotone; (3) discharge,
stage, and sediment load data documenting recent fluvial processes; and (4) the archaeological record
of regional culture history and settlement location variability. The focus is Stranger Creek, a major
tributary of the Kansas River and analog of its effects on prehistoric sites, Both streams have, through
later planation, significantly altered the archaeological record in their lower reaches. Inferences about
past settlement systems in this region must account for geomorphic dynamics affecting their archae-
ological manifestations. (32)

Ceramic Ethnoarchaeology: An Overview.

The study of pottery among extant societies by archaeologists began over 100 years ago. There is,

Archaeological Research in Southeastern New Mexico: The WIPP.

Excavations in southeastern New Mexico centering around the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP),
sponsored by the Corps of Engineers (Albuquerque District), have produced valuable information with
regard to regional chronological controls. A series of radiocarbon dates from three sites suggest that
tbe projectile point and ceramic chronologies currently used in the region are in error. The presence
of brownware ceramics with projectile points which have been assigned to the Late Archaic Hueco
phase indicate an overlap in the two major phases represented in the region. This overlap indicates
chat major revisions in the cultural-temporal sequence in the region are needed, (40)

Hanter as Producer; An Australian Perspective.

The organization of production in Australian aboriginal societies is discussed, drawing upon both
ethnographic and archaeological examples. Intensification of resource use and manipulation is shown
ue be connected with intergroup gatherings and ceremonies, Examples include large-scale artificial
@ainage systems, and intensive use of cereals, tubers, and cycads. This evidence is viewed from a
social perspective and explanation involves tension caused by expansion of competitive social net-
works and perhaps trends towards social differentiation. Comparisons are made with Melanesian
borticulturalists, indicating the operation of broadly similar socioeconomic processes. (49)

Regional Variation in Massachusetts Ceramics.

Prehistoric ceramics from Massachusetts have proven resistant to typology, perhaps because of a
good deal of local variation in the associations of technological and stylistic attributes, In order to
test this hypothesis, assemblages from sites on the Boston Harbor Islands and Nantucket are compared
with an assemblage from the Merrimack River Valley in which strong associations between certain
key attributes have been defined. Each assemblage includes a full spectrum of Middle and Late
Woodland styles, and together they provide a cross-section of the Massachusetts coastal zone. Social
and economic implications of the findirfgs are discussed, (5)

Archaeologists interested in cultural processes have for the most part confined their analyses to
two levels: (1) the artifactually descriptive and (2) the causally explanatory. We believe that such
approaches are incomplete and that a further behavioral analysis must be undertaken on the exper-

Survey and Total Excavation.

During the last 20 years there have been some major projects in West Germany aiming at total
excavation of whole settlements (e.g. Feddersen Wierde, Flogeln, Oberschwaben-Bodensee, Alden-
hover Platte}. There is now a growing tendency to concentrate on small regions (Siedlungskammern).
A combination of planned and rescue excavations in the Rhineland has given good opportunities for
this type of research. Following different levels from house to settlement to region new insights have
been gained into the development from the early to the late Neolithic period. (15)

Paleoecological Interpretations of Archaeologically Rare Taxa in the Holocene of Eastern Washington.

Frequencies of ursid remains in eastern Washington during the last 7000 years fluctuate in manners
suggestive of a Middle Holocene climatic interval marked by winters that were shorter and/or more
mild than during Late Holocene. The presence of arctic fox and columbian ground squirrel bones in
Early Holocene sediments suggest this time period was climatically characterized by summers that
were approximately 1-20C cooler and/or which received 20 cm annual precipitation more than at

Pinson Mounds: Internal Chronology and External Relationships.

The Pinson Mounds Site |40MD1) consists of at least 12 mounds, a geometric embankment, and
associated short-term habitation areas. Recent research has conclusively demonstrated that the entire
mound complex, which includes 5 large platform mounds, dates to the Middle Woodland Period. The
platform mounds were apparently built between A.D. 100-200 and the site ceased to function as a
regional ceremonial center around A.D, 300. Relationships between Pinson Mounds and other Middle
Woodland platform mound sites in the mid-south are discussed. (34)

Models of the Political Economy of Late Classic Copan.

Many years of research at Copan clearly demonstrate a lack of any significant level of economic
specialization. The small proportion of people, and low levels of energy involved in specialized
production indicate its lack of systemic importance in terms of urbanism, market development, and
the maintenance of political dominance. These conclusions may be applicable to other Maya polities.
Several models are presented which elucidate the relationships between low levels of economic
specialization and the Maya political economy generally. (1)

Late Prehistoric Agricultural Terracing in the Colca Valley, Peru: Preliminary Report.

The Colca Valley contains some of the most extensive and well preserved agricultural terraces in
the New World, yet little is known concern,ing their age or the reasons for their construction or
abandonment. Excavations have suggested that the terraces are post-Middle Horizon, yet many appear
to be pre-Incaic. Preliminary survey results suggest the highest terraces are oldest, with those nearest
the river being the most recent. At least two phases of terrace construction have been identified.
Climatic change, autochthonous cultural processes and foreign domination will be discussed as
possible causes for the developments noted, (28)

Geomorphology and Archaeology of the Western Desert of Egypt.

Recent research near Kharga Oasis in the Western Desert of Egypt documented numerous prehistoric
archaeological sites along the edge of the Libyan Plaeatu and in the Kharga Depression. These sites
are commonly associated with playas and former springs. The archaeological record indicates that
there were four periods of prehistoric human occupation in the study area: Late Acheulian, Mouster-
ian-Aterian, Terminal Paleolithic, and Neolithic. The geomorphic evidence suggests that the first
three periods were separated by hyper-arid climatic episodes at least as dry as the modern climate of
the Western Desert. This paper summarizes the results of the investigations. (55)

Cordage, Knots, and Netting: Technological Approaches to Ethnicity and Cultural Stability.

Cordage is one of the oldest perishable artifacts recovered from American archaeological sites. The
processes and attributes involved in cordage, knot, and net manufacture are described and illustrated
with examples from Trans-Pecos Texas and the Ohio Valley. The distribution of cordage attributes
suggest that cordage manufacture represents a highly standardized motor habit. The construction of
setting, however, involves greater variability and several levels of decision making which make it
more amenable to stylistic analysis. Attributes involved in cordage and net manufacture rank low on
the hierarchical scale of artifact styles but are still useful in delineating prehistoric and ethnographic
cultural boundaries. (16)

A Regional Approach to Middle Gila Basin Prehistory.

Surveys undertaken by Northland Research Inc., for the Central Arizona Project over the last several

sampled areas that traditionally have been regarded as somewhat marginal to the “rich” zones of
prehistoric occupation. Yet, in nearly every case, a large inventory of sites has been recorded. If we
tegerd these results as representative, then the conventional models of southwestern archaeology are
emadequate to account for them, and new models are required. (58)

Resource Acquisition and Mobility Strategies in Settlement Modeling.

The concept of site function, widely used in settlement systems analysis, has seldom been effec-
tively operationalized. Definitions which lack linking arguments are employed to classify sites,
resulting in models which are not testable. This paper argues that a testable settlement typology must
stress organizational aspects of cultural systems. Site placement and activities conducted are a
function of the resource acquisition and mobility strategies which are dependent on the overall
adaptation and environmental variability. Utilizing modem environmental data, a settlement model
for the Pueblo period in west Texas is developed and initial tests performed. (3)

Analysis of the ceramics recovered from test excavations conducted at Fort Ninigret was carried

The Effect of Chultuns on Household Configurations and Settlement Patterns at Sayil, Yucatan,

An absence of surface water in the dry Puuc Hills of Yucatan, necessitated the construction of

characterized by location, density, and correlation with structure types. Geological and architectural
factors affecting chultun construction are discussed in terms of their influence on the size of the
residential unit and on community settlement patterns. It is proposed that these vital facilities may
have structured residential patterns by encouraging planned construction and discouraging accretional
growth. (39)

Paleoenvironmental Implications of Research at the Site of Simbi, Western Kenya.

The Sangoan Industrial Complex is known primarily from samples from questionable archaeological
wontext. Because of the geographic distribution of Sangoan finds in Equatorial Africa, the industry has
been believed to be an adaptation to a forested or woodland environment. Recent research indicates
an arid or semiarid grassland environment for Sangoan sites from which we have data. At the site of
Simbi in western Kenya, the presence of large and medium herbivore fossils precludes a closed
woodland habitat at the time of the Sangoan habitation. (56)

ecology that may influence the selection of specific hunting strategies. (35)

modeling hunting behavior and its archaeological consequences. The goals of this work are indisput-
ably important, but Binford’s derivation of the utility indices is unnecessarily complex, making
interpretation difficult and potentially stifling incentive to continue this line of research. Using

produce a better fit with Binford’s observational data than the original indices. (7)

Besic Interpretive Requirements of Prehistoric Ethnobotany.

Prehistoric ethnobotany must develop interpretive protocols. Ethno-botanists must use as many
betanical data sets as possible and not concentrate on one artifact set (e.g. seeds), As plant/people
snteractions are ecological, change in one interaction may create other changes. The analysis of many
Gate sets increases the probability of detecting a range of interactions. As ethnobotanists do not
gdequately understand the factors affecting patterning in ethnobotanical assemblages, analyses should
emeentrate on the interpretation of changes in like categories. Sophisticated quantitative analyses
eam be more sensitive than our interpretive sensitivity, thus yielding unverifiable patterning. (53)

ef production are present. Additionally, there are areas of tool use not related to production. These
seclude nondiagnostic expedient tools that reflect specialized activities carried out near plentiful raw
seacenal. Initial reduction as well as auxiliary tool production and use were conducted near the raw

Variability in Central European Gravettian Settlements.

Results of the excavations at Kamegg, Lower Austria, are presented in the framework of a settlement
study of the Central European Gravettian (28,000-14,000}, Settlements of that period are open air sites
that exhibit a considerable degree of variability: stable camps with several dwellings and large quan-
tities and varieties of artifacts; seasonal camps with habitation structures lower density of arti,facts
and more limited range of artifact types; hunting camps with hearths and low artifact counts; and
specialized camps, like Kamegg, where the manufacture of bone tools was the predominant activity.
The Gravettian corresponds to the later stages of the last Glacial when major changes affected the
climate and environment of the Central European Plain. Settlement variability is examined in relation
to climatic changes in an effort to understand the impact of the last major glacial advance on the

series of stratified rockshelter deposits. Faunal remains from Preceramic and Formative components
indicate fundamental shifts in subsistence practices and cultural attitudes toward animals during the
4th millennium B. C. Two measures of hunter selectivity (ratio of cervid to camelid remains, and age
specific mortality curves of prey animals) document these changes repeatedly with significant varia-
tion within a local area. Data from Telarmachay and Panaulauca permit finegrained analysis of the
changes in animal morphology and demography that accompanied this process of domestication. (42)

Archaic Projectile Point Typology: Chronology in the Four Corners Area.

Metric and morphological data generated from the analysis of several hundred Archaic projectile
points from the Four Corners region of the Southwest were examined. The goals of this project were
to develop an objective means of defining Archaic point types and to determine if some variation in
defined point types is temporal or spatial. The statistical means of defining Archaic projectile point
types, especially within the Oshara Tradition, is presented. (38)

Federal Involvement in California Archaeology, 1945-1985.

Partly because Federal agencies own or control yast areas in California, and partly as a result of
legislative changes, the Federal Government has greatly influenced the direction, intensity, and
quality of archaeology in this state. Positive trends since 1945 evidence increasingly thorough surveys,
better inventories of cultural resources, improved management of these resources, a diminished rate
of site destruction, the emergence of phased |testing/data recovery) excava,tions, more support for
large-scale/multidisciplinary rersearch, greater attention to historical archaeology, and more partici-
pation by Native Americans in archaeological work. Negative developments have also occurred, but
overall the influence of the Federal Government has been highly beneficial to the growth of profes-
sional archaeology and to the protection of archaeological resources in California. (18)

Morenon, E. Pierre (Rhode Island)
Rhode Island Potsherds: High Tech Studies of Tiny and Worn Fragments.

Studies of prehistoric pottery in Rhode Island have been limited to the analysis of small numbers
of tiny fragments which are typically abraded. This has made it difficult to characterize ceramic
assemblages and interpret them. Moreover, comparisons between pottery sequences in Rhode Island
and other regions are nearly impossible. Recent results from CTSCAN and TL dates are used to
illustrate a solution to several of these problems, The application of “high tech” methods may also
result in standardized descriptions of ceramic assemblages, an essential step if ceramic data are to be
used to solve problems which extend beyond state borders. (5)

Analysis of Floor Samples from a Hogback Phase, Early Ceramic Period, House at the Kinney Springs
Site (5LR144c), North-central Colorado.

Floor material from a stone walled oval structure was sampled in 25 x 25 x 5 cm units. A
radiocarbon date from the floor is 950 + 60 B.P. (Beta 10196). A second date from a hearth 15 cm under
the floor is 1120+60 B.P. (Beta 10195}, Other dates in association with Hogback phase material are
1510+70B.P, (Beta (7328) and 1650+ 70 B.P. (Beta 7329). The Hogback phase is characterized by cord-
marked ceramics and small triangular corner-notched projectile points. Besides artifacts and charcoal,
water separation analysis provided evidence on the non-random distribution of tiny lithics, bone
fragments and seeds. Preliminary distributional interpretation permits formulation of intramural
activity hypotheses. (32)

Uses of Functional Analysis to Answer ARchaeological Questions: Paleolithic Europe, 12,500-9000
BP.

Functional analysis. or microwear analysis, employing polish identification has far broader and
more significant applicability than is generally known. Sample selection which is aimed toward
answering archaeological questions provides a whole new framework for approaching lithic material.
The examples, taken from four final Paleolithic sites in western Europe, center on the questions of
hearth use, spatial distribution and chronology of activities on a site, temporal change in functional
tectors, cultural variability and seasonality. Inter-site comparisons are possible at some levels. (57)

West Mexican Stone Stelae from Jalisco and Nayarit.

Although the erection of stone stelae is a major feature of heartland Mesoamerican culture from
Middle Formative times through the Classic, the penetration of this trait into western Mesoamerica
ss generally believed to have reached no farther than southern Michoacan, at the end of the Classic.
However, recent investigations by the author have resulted in the discovery of 17 stela-like stones—
four with pecked designs—at nine sites in Jalisco and Nayarit. Evidence is presented that these stones
ere stelae, that they relate to sun god cult rituals, and that they may all date to the Postclassic. Some
eeleural implications of this belated peripheral development are discussed. (28)

eethin a settlement’s immediate catchment. Certain special crops (maize and coca) were concentrated
@ elite households. Following Inka conquest, settlements relocated to lower elevations and agricul-
teal production apparently came to focus on maize, a crop highly desired by the state staple finance
eystem. Agriculture as a tie between the household economy and state economy is discussed. (10)

Mid-Holocene Population Change in Southern New England: A Geographic Information System
Approach.

Heman responses to environmental change throughout the Middle Holocene are evaluated using a

eed environmental data suggest that environmental change had a major effect on human populations.
‘Tyee episodes of mast (nut tree) pollen decline occurred during the 7th and 6th millenia B.P. and after
the 4th. Both episodes correlate with a decline in prehistoric site frequency, as does a colder climate
1.000 years ago. A decline in hemlock pollen 4,500 years ago, accompanied by peaks in oak and other
ast pollens, corresponds with the highest frequency of archaeological sites in prehistory. (6)

Mississippian Art and Specialization.

New evidence on Mississippian production throws doubt on the concept of specialist artisans,
Dyeersty and exchange of Mississippian ‘‘art" products are examined from a stylistic perspective in
ender to assess the degree of specialization and transformation of wealth. The internal and external
eles of the artist are assessed from evidence on the manufacture and distribution of “valuables.”
\Astsstic production systems are compared to those of utilitarian objects of exchange. Artisan skill in
seme materials was very high, but it is unclear that this can be taken as an indication of full-time ar
“craft” specialization. Special emphasis will be placed on the nature of shell art object production.

Observation, Elaboration, and Purpose of Household Contextual Data at Penon del Rio: Technique,
Method, Theory.

Recovery techniques for archaeological habitation context at this deep, stratified local center with
the Penon del Rio raised field complex, are reviewed for three time periods spanning 2500 years of
occupation at the site. Designed for the tropical lowland, floodplain (Guayas basin) environment,
these techniques and the methodological framework established specific limits for archaeological
inference at all subsequent steps of the investigation process. Methods and descriptive/classificatory
criteria employed at the level of integration and data analysis are illustrated. Finally, a holistic concept
of production (as opposed to the currently widespread technological or strictly economic idea) provides
the basis by which these data can be used to infer social transformation processes. (48)

Epiclassic Interaction: Eclecticism and Exchange of Cacaxtla and Xochicalco.

The aim of this presentation is to reasses the nature of foreign interaction and influences, especially
Maya, at the Epiclassic Central Highland sites of Cacaxtla and Xochicalco. A consideration of the
foreign ties seen in the style and iconography of the monumental arts (architecture, sculpture, mural
painting) will be compared with evidence for “outside influence’ manifested by more portable items
of trade at these two sites. Implications for divergent patterns of interaction evidenced by archaco-
logical and artistic materials will be discussed. (20)

Reliability, Validity, and Quantitative Methods in Archaeology.

Over the last three decades quantitative methods have become increasingly prevalent in archaeol-
ogy. Archaeologists now employ descriptive and inferential statistics, seriation methods, multivariate
statistics and a host of other computer-assisted procedures that require quantitative data. Yet, few
archaeologists have undertaken examination of the reliability of their quantitative observations, or
the validity of the variables they routinely measure. This paper provides definitions of reliability and
validity, discusses some methods for measuring reliability and validity statistically, and discusses the

. relevance of these concepts for modern archaeology. (9)

Regional Styles and Organizational Hierarchies: The View from Chaco Canyon.

Interaction within hierarchically organized sociopolitical systems is considered in terms of its
impact on regional styl istic patterning. In pre-state sedentary societies, multiple styles which overlap
spatially to varying degrees can be expected. Such patterning is present in the complex regional system
which was centered around Chaco Canyon in the northern Southwest. The distributions of several
ceramic design styles are documented in order to examine the kinds of horizontal and vertical
relationships which existed at different spatial scales. (23)

Domestic and Public Contexts at the Cementerio de Nanchoc Site: Defining Preceramic Public and
Domestic Production.

The 7000 year old Cementerio de Nanchoc site is located in northern Peru in a tributary valley of
the Zana River, the Nanchoc Quebrada. It consists of two rudimentary platform mounds, presumably
religious in function, which are separated from an area of habitation and production by a gully with
seasonal discharge. In the latter area, spatial distribution, residues present and the artifacts employed
are used to define domestic and non-domestic production areas. The early date of this site and the
, Norconk, Marilyn 117
presence of recognizable platform mounds together with an extensive habitation and work area make
these data of particular interest. (48)

Late Archaic—Middle Woodland Occupations In Southeastern Minnesota.

Based upon research since 1981, the conception of the Root River drainage in southeastern Min-
nesota as marginal to Upper Midwestern prehistory is rejected. Point styles are identical to those
found throughout the eastern United States, while the only sites containing mica in the region are
found there as well. The presence of Knife River chalcedony and Hixton ‘quartzite’ are evidence for
extensive regional interactions. Usewear analysis showing that most points served as knives for hide
working suggest that a seasonal band organization analogous to that found on the Canadian Shield
might be more appropriate than the previous idea of male-dominated hunting camps. (33)

Specific expectations are generated for the relative importance of agricultural production, wild plant

Geological Evaluation of Archaic Sites Located in Aeolian Depositional Environments.

Difficulties posed by sites in aeolian deposits are compounded when such sites contain either non-

Demographic Reconstructions in the American Southwest: The Relationship Between Expectations
and Data.

Demographic reconstructions for the prehistoric American Southwest are frequently based on an
s==p/acit assumption of high population density. This, in turn, leads to interpretations of archaeological
semazins that support the original expectation. An alternative expectation, low population density,
‘eds to different interpretations of the same archaeological remains. Data from Black Mesa, northern
Acscoma, are used to illustrate this pattern, and implications for models of Anasazi sociopolitical
epelution are considered. (3)

‘The Genesee Connection: Iroquois Origins in Western New York.

Actempts to identify transitional Owasco-Iroquois sites in the Genesse Valley have relied on
seeSequate diagnostic criteria. A reanalysis of ceramic patterns in the Genesee reveals that the local
@eeemic sequence reflects patterns of cultural contact and development which are unique to western
ew York. A regional cultural sequence based on local ceramic data provides evidence for a transi-
moma! phase which begins with a sudden influx of Ontario Iroquois traits ca. A.D. 1200-1250. The
eee of this Ontario Iroquois connection prompts a reexamination of current assumptions regarding
egess origins and a redefinition of in situ development in western New York. (5)

Sena! Tomography to measure the skulls at predetermined reference points. Samples of normal skulls

Activity Pattern Identification Through Model Building and Testing: Southwestern Examples.

Analyzing artifact distributions and retrodiction of past activities are often a goal of archaeological
research. One method of study entails the development of a series of hierarchically arrayed activity
models from ethnographic and archaeological literature. The expected material residues of the models
are then compared with statistically defined spatial clusters of artifacts and interior features in order
to identify the activities that oceurred in Anasazi structures. Using data from the Mesa Verde and
Pecos areas, activity patterns present in pithouses, kivas, and several functional classes of surface
rooms are described synchronically and compared diachronically. (3)

Mapping Resources and Human Activities in Alaska.

Large quantities of information on presently undisturbed environments and human foraging activ-
ities are being collected by resource management agencies in Alaska. This information permits
construction of cartographic models of resource abundance and study of the relationship between
spatial distribution of resources and human foraging and settlement patterns. Different methods of

Lithic Tool Curation and Mobility: An Example from South Carolina.

Differential preservation of artifact classes has resulted in increased research of lithic artifacts to
delineate mobility patterns of prehistoric peoples. The study of curated tools, specialized tool pro-
duction, and debitage byproducts of lithic resources from documented quarry sites can provide infor-
mation about mobility and/or exchange among hunter-gatherer and sedentary groups. Broken bifaces
and debitage, made of locally quarried materials that have been recovered from retooling sites illustrate
the types of tools that are desired for curation. The form in which bifaces and cores were produced,
used, and transported reflects the technological variability of prehistoric adaptations. Discarded tools
of extralocal materials illustrate the end point of a curated technological system. Results of debitage
and tool analysis from South Carolina representing these types of behavior are presented and discussed.

Intensive Surface Collection and Sample Excavation of a Middle Woodland Havana Community,

Surface materials are used in CRM work for several purposes, including identifying site function
and interpreting community pattern, The ability to filter out ‘noise’ in surface data is critical,
especially when a data set is used to stratify a site for low-intensity excavation. A prehistoric com-
munity in eastern Missouri containing extensive Middle Woodland Havana remains was collected
intensively, and density distributions of several material classes were used to stratify the site for
excavation. Given the questionable nature of plans for preserving the site, the surface collection and
how it was used become important considerations. (26)

Late Pleistocene Australian Prehistory: Overview and Comparison with Other Areas of the World.

The Australian prehistoric sequence displays some interesting similarities and differences with
sequences from other parts of the world, especially the Americas. The continent was initially occupied
40,00-50,000 B.P., probably by fully modem Homo sapiens. Data suggesting an earlier occupation by
archaic Homo sapiens or Homo erectus are questionable. The earliest solid economic data suggest
that broad spectrum diets, based partly on fish and shellfish, were established in the continental
interior by 30,000 B.P., much earlier than elsewhere. Early Australians may have played a role in the
extinction of Pleisto,cene megafauna, but if so it was after a long period (>15,000 yrs} of co-existence.
Similarities and differences between this sequence and those from other parts of the world are probably
the product of the same processes operating in differ,ent environments. (4)

Settlement Plans, Environmental Constraints, and Refuse Disposal Patterns.

At any site location, topography and wind direction impose certain constraints on the final form of
asettlement, In general, these constraints pertain to efficient maintenance of the communal enyiron-
ment. This study relates the distribution of faunal materials in plowzone and subplowzone features
of the Bridges site to the above environmental variables. These data then serve as the basis for
inferences about the location of the plaza, principal refuse disposal area, communal processing area,
and probable storage areas. This interpretation of the spatial organization at Bridges conflicts with
the existing diachronic explanation of this Mississippian settlement. (24)

Sociopolitical Complexity in Aboriginal California: A Review of the Evidence.

Recent ethnographic and archaeological work has claimed that sociopolitical organization in aborig-
imal California was more complex than has traditionally been thought. These claims counter entrenched
models of native Californians as isolated simple folk’ and that their hunting-gathering economies
secessarily imply egalitarian band societies. Archaeological arguments use differential mortuary
practices to infer ranked societies. Recent ethnographic syntheses argue for ranked societies and
possibly chiefdoms. The quality of these data is reviewed, along with the assumptions required to
infer social behavior from mortuary practices. It is concluded that present ethnological and archaeo-
logical evidence is insuffi,cient to substantiate the claims made. (2)

Bone Bed Formation Processes and the Interpretation of Bone Distribution Patterns on Bison Kill
Sites.

Attempts to derive cultural meaning from bone distribution analyses of bison kill sites must first
consider the natural processes involved in bone bed formation. Rearticulation analyses of bison bone
trom Shield Trap (24CB91), a pit cave where man may be factored out of the taphonomic equation,
show that large bones are buried less rapidly than small bones. A consequence of the longer exposure
@ larger bones to taphonomic processes active on the surface is the greater lateral dispersal of large
Somes. Body parts associated with large bones also have high nutrient values, Thus, a positive corre-
lesion between bone dispersal distance and body part utility may not be a good measure of butchery
sctivity on bison kill sites. (7)

The Spatial Expression of Socioeconomic Behavior.

In order to use settlment plans for examining broad questions of social and economic change,
archaeologists must be able to identify the aspects of these plans that reflect social and economic
behavior. A case study of the Zulu in South Africa exemplifies the intricate relationship of their
settlement plans to their socioeconomic organization. Reasons for this close relationship are dis-
cussed, as well as the implications of this study for recognition of socioeconomic organization from
settlement plans under other circumstances. (24)

The Archaic Occupation of Northern Black Mesa, Arizona.

Recent investigations by the Black Mesa Archaeological Project have documented a non-intensive
occupation of Black Mesa, Arizona, during the Archaic Period. Six sites yielded discrete radiometri-
cally dated Archaic components. Two sites were occupied in the Early Archaic (ca, 6000 B.C.) while
the other four date between 1750-700 B.C. Five sites are small ephemeral campsites, but the remaining
site (Tsosie Shelter) contains over 6m of stratified deposits with dates ranging from 6200-2800 B.C.
The lithic assemblages from these sites differ from those of later preceramic (Basketmaker II} sites on
northern Black Mesa. Projectile points are highly variable with little correspondence to established
types. (38)

Critical Reflections on a Decade of 100% Survey in the Valley of Mexico.

Complete survey coverage has produced a consistent data set which has been useful in making
inferences about population, land use, and social organization, In retrospect, however, there are
identifiable conceptual and methodological weaknesses which need to be examined in designing
comparable new work. These include not only such obyious matters as surface collection procedures,
observational intensity, and site definition, but also the question of whether or not a well-designed
sampling program might be more cost effective relative to data quality. This paper examines these
issues, and concludes that for areas of high surface visibility, 100% coverage still deserves serious
consideration. (50)

utilized: presence analysis, frequency of occurrence, and diversity. The patterns of change determined
by each measurement are discussed and the relationships between the measurements explored. Factors
contributing to the observable patterns are proposed. These include: (1) the nature of refuge disposal
ar the site, (2) changes in technology, and (3) changes in food choice. |53)

The Terminal Postclassic and Early Historic Community at Lamanai.

1983-84 excavations at Lamanai revealed portions of the Terminal Postclassic and Early Historic
community, marked by ceramics distinct from those of earlier centuries, and equally distinctive
erchitecture. Middens and building surfaces also produced numerous copper artifacts in association
wath European glass beads, ceramics, and metal objects. The data permit preliminary characteristics
ef the final Lamanai settlement and the effects of Spanish presence; they also make clear the need
for further examination of the community in 1985. In addition, the work illuminates many of the
problems inherent in excavation of late prehistoric and early historic Maya remains. {21}

Late Caddoan Adaptive Strategies on the Prairie- Woodland Border.

At the time of European contact there were two distinct types of Caddoan agricultural societies on

teed distinct and non-complementary sociopolitical, ceremonial and settlement systems whereas
erends in economic strategies were similar and manifest complementary regional developmental
grocesses. Changes in inter-regional exchange with polities living in the South Plains and Southwest

Excavations at the Brigham Site: A Holocene Occupational Sequence from Northern New England.

Recent excavations at the Brigham site in central Maine have revealed a stratified human occupa-
tional sequence which spans the entire Holocene after 10,300 B.P. Cultural remains are well isolated
in 10 of the 12 natural strata defined at the site, including features and associated subsistence remains,
lithics and in the most recent occupations, ceramics. These remains permit correlation of the various
occupations with other archaeological complexes of the Late Paleolndian, Early Archaic, Middle
Archaic, Late Archaic, and Woodland (Ceramic} periods in northeastern North America. Particular
emphasis is given to chronological and subsistence data for the entire span of occupation since these
have been rarely isolated at any other single locality in northern New England and the broader
Northeast. (33)

Environmental Constraints on Agricultlure at Dolores.

Tree-ring indices and pollen analyses provide proxy records for both short- and long-term changes
in summer and winter precipitation amounts and growing season lengths for southwestern Colorado.
Long-term changes in the locations of the regional potential dry-farming belt limited the settlement
location choices of agriculturalists and provided impetus for migrations into and out of the Dolores
area. Short-term effects of climate on potential field locations and crop yields within the Dolores area
affected settlement locations, and subsistence and organizational strategies. (44) |

Regional Styles and Punctuated Equilibrium Models.

The occurrence of truly regional styles on painted ceramics in the northem US Southwest is
considered. These are shown to be episodic and to cover different geographical areas at different times.
The organizational and behavioral processes that generate regional styles are identified and also shown
to be episodic in time and space. The relationship between this variability and environmental and

Structure, Form, and Content in Southwestern Design Styles.

Several approaches to the description and analysis of Southwestern ceramic design styles have been

although most discussions seem to implicitly assume that there is minimal correlation. This issue is
addressed from both a theoretical and an empirical perspective, with the latter discussion focusing
on the development of regional stylistic traditions in the northern Southwest. (23)

coupled with new cartographic and archaeological data, provides insight into the structure and role
ef copper, gold, and silver production in the Protohistoric Tarascan State. A comparison is made
between the very distinctive ways in which the central Balsas, southeast frontier (Cutzamala-Aju-

menic core of the state. (28)

Quantitative Measurements in Paleoethnobotany.

Paleoethnobotanists use several quantitative measurements to describe and analyze their data. This
paper discusses the conditions under which absolute counts, ubiquity, and ranking are appropriate
and useful for qualifying archaeobotanical data. How do these measurements differ in their assump-
tions about archaeobotanical data, and what information do they give about such data? Paleoethno-
botanists must take into account the quality of preservation of their archaeobotanical remains, the
contexts of their samples, the number of sites understudy, and theirresearch questions before selecting
which quantitative measurements to use, (53)

Experience Transfer from Engineering to Archaeology.

It is argued that many conditions that are fairly new in archaeology are well established in engi-

applicable in both fields. Characteristics which shape these conditions, problems and solutions in
each field are compared. They include: traditions, philosophy; training; applications; professional
organization; recognition and treatment of social issues. Interactions within and betweenjjjjentities
of educational institutions, industry and government are examined for each field, It is suggested that
an “experience transfer” from engineering to archaeology would be beneficial. Ways of implementing
such a transfer are explored. (2)

Middle Preclassic Settlement at Colha, Belize.

Recent investigations, in 1983 and 1985, into the Middle Preclassic period settlement are described.
Fieldwork at Colha in the last two seasons has centered on the functional definition of two localities
within the Middle Preclassic component (Operations 2012 and 2031), both of which lie beneath the
site's monumental center. Operation 2012 has revealed what appears to be a specialized structure
used for mortuary activities. Excavations at Operation 2031 have produced structures, features, and
artifacts in a context that suggests a domestic/habitation function. This apparent internal fuctional
differentiation in the Middle Preclassic component at Colha is compared with contemporary com-
ponents at other sites. (54)

Cultural Adaptive Variability at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.

The semi-arid climate of Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, has imposed severe, fluctuating environ-
mental conditions on its human occupants. Based on recent archacological and paleoenvironmental
research, Chaco Anasazi and historic Navajo settlement and subsistence adaptations are examined.
It is argued that agriculturally dependent Anasazi adaptation evolved to ameliorate short term drought
effects but did not allow positive adaptive response to long term drought. In contrast, the generalized
subsistence base, and mobility of the Navajo allowed greater flexibility and adaptability to short and
long term climatic perturbations. Implications for survival of secondary agri,culturist adaptations on
the Colorado Plateau are discussed. (3)

Settlement Pattern Succession on the Pajarito Plateau: Hudson’s Model Revisited.

Hudson's theory for rural settlement is tested with archaeological data from the Pajarito Plateau,
New Mexico. The model distinguishes three stages of settlement process: colonization, spread, and
competition, each of which is characterized by specific spatial properties regarding settlement density,
settlement distribution, and average site size. Two types of point pattern analysis are employed to
quantify settlement distribution, and basic descriptive statistics are used to monitor changes in site
size over time. Empirical examination of the Puebloan settlement pattern within the study area from
A.D. 1175-1550 suggests the expected sequence of stages did occur, and it is concluded that the model,
despite theoretical limitations, provides a high level explanation of the processes of settlement pattern
evolution. (3)

Lies in Archaeology: Ideology and Behavior in Corporate Descent Groups.

The behaviors associated with corporate descent groups in ethnography can be considered as
variable, i.e., as manifesting degrees of corporateness in response to demographic and economic
processes. The ideology of corporateness should thus vary in a manner consonant with the variable
role of such groups in a given social system. These differences should be regularly recognizable on
the basis of the patterning and distribution of material objects. In this paper we suggest strategies for
the archaeological recognition of such social variation. (49)

The Close of the Pleistocene in Northern Europe.

Northern Europe offers an outstanding laboratory for the investigation of human adaptation from
12,000 B.C. until the advent of the Neolithic. Major changes in climate, landscape, and topography
accompany the close of the Pleistocene in northern Europe. Replacement of arctic flora and fauna by
more temperate species following 8000 B.C. offers new opportunities to the inhabitants of the area.
Significant changes involve the transition from migratory arctic hunters to sedentary fishing-hunting
peoples. Information on subsistence and settlement documents major changes in co-resident group
size and in the season and duration of site occupation in this transition. Also of note is the distinct
absence of evidience from important areas within the large region. Changes in sea level have hidden
zones that originally were the focus of human occupation. (52)

Colha, Monopolistic Theories and the Development of Major Political Centers.

Economic factors, particularly monopolies, have long had prominence in archaeological theories of
how major centers formed. Such reasoning has become axiomatic and has been employed to account
for the emergence of Kaminaljuyu, Teotihuacan, and many other sites. At Colha a monopoly in lithic
industrial production is manifest in the Late Preclassic when hundreds of thousands of tools were
produced. In all of what is now Belize, no other site had such a monopoly. Yet, Colha was never a
prominent center. This paper compares magnitude, scale, and organization of production at several
Mesoamerican Late Preclassic sites and reconsiders monopolistic theories and what consitutes a
primary center. (54)

Archaeological Theory and Statistical Methods: A Fundamental Discordance and a Possible Resolu-

The incorporation of more complex statistical procedures into the analysis of archaeological data

cation of statistical methods at a technical level, Justification, however, must ultimately be made at
the level of the conceptual foundations underlying statistical methodology and the conceptual frame-
work of archaeological theory. It is argued in this paper that there is an automatic discordance between
the assumptions underlying the practice of statistical analysis of data and the theoretical framework
used to give meaning to archaeological data. A resolution of this discor,dance is illustrated in the

The Modeling of Classic Period Communities in South-Central Arizona.

This paper examines the evidence for a particular type of dispersed “urban-like” community pattern
which originated during the Classic Period of the Hohokam and related traditions. Their community
complexes include elite and nonelite reidences, public buildings, systems of terrace gardens, and
specialized work areas. Such complexes may cover up to 10 square miles, and can be treated as single
although dispersed communities. Data gathered from the Tonto Basin as part of CRM sponsored
esearch are used to support this model. It is shown that the levels of funding needed to fully document
the organization of these Classic Period community complexes can only be expected through CRM
projects. (58)

The Evolution of Symbolic Cultural Traits.

Human uses of symbols represent one of our species’ most distinctive characteristics and one of
the most difficult to understand in Darwinian terms. A model of cultural evolution under the influence
of indirect bias, a choice-based force formally analogous to female-choice sexual selection, is used to
examine these controversial difficulties. Under some circumstances, indirect bias leads to fitness
maximization; under others to the evolution of group-functional or afunctional traits. If the model is
apt, sociobiological and symbolic hypotheses can be compared within a consistent theoretical frame-
work. (17}

Darwin's Essay of 1844 and Evolutionary Theory in Anthropology.

Darwin's concept of evolution in 1844 differed from that presented in the Origin of Species in
several important ways. Species were seen in typological terms. Individual variation was seen as
accidental in relation to evolutionary change. Selection was intermittent and produced a perfect
adaptation of the species to the environment. Most “modern” evolutionary and ecological models in
anthropology resemble Darwin's idealistic and natural-theological theory of 1844 and have yet to
incorporate the ideas he finally advanced in 1859. (17)

In this paper, prehistoric water collection and conservation practices are inferred from archaeological
remains and ethnographic analogy with historic horticulturalists in arid to semi-arid regions of the
world. Archaeological data are drawn from archaeological survey of portions of Antelope Prairie,
within Wupatki National Monument, Arizona, and from limited excavations at two sites, each
consisting of a prehistoric reservoir or water catchment basin, Paleoenvironmental conditions for the
study period (A.D, 1065-1300) are considered and analogy with historic cultures ot generally similar
environments is used. (3)

Evaluation of the Dolores Archaeological Program's Modeling Effort.

The results of testing the Dolores Archaeological Program's least-cost based model are summarized
and evaluated. The model provides an explanatory framework for the overall trends and some of the
detail of cultural change in the Dolores area for the A.D. 600-980 time period, Weaknesses are evident
in those aspects of cultural systems where expectations are less explicitly derived from least-cost
principles. Some apparent discrepancies between expectations and observations are examined using
slrernative formulations, particularly a maximization model. (44)

Spatial Variability and Social Variability: Analysis of Navajo Settlement Patterns.

The spatial correlates of social units are examined using settlement data from previously published
ethnographic studies of five Navajo communities in Arizona and New Mexico, These studies include
recent (1970s) and older |1930s) data. Two issues are addressed: (1) the correspondence of ethnograph-
wally observed social proximity to settlement proximity and (2) the correspondence of discrete units
wath discrete clusters identifiable in the settlement data. Contingency table, nearest neighbor, and
eboster analyses are used. Seasonal settlement shifts and economic variables are considered in account-
ime for the variability observed among the five samples of settlement data. (3)

Colha Lithic Production as a Factor in Settlement Pattern Analysis.

Settlement pattern analysis at Colha depends on the firm justification of various activity loci.
Drawing on Late Classic evidence at the site, this area details how areas of lithic production are
deSined. These manufacturing points are of prime interest because the massive debitage deposits at
Collha remain essentially unique. Based on findings at several Late Classic deposits, some crucial
serminology is defined. What constitutes a Colha workshop? What is our conception of craft special-
ssytion? The archaeological evidence is provided to justify the use of these concepts. A look is provided
at recent lithic analysis that attempts to measure the evidence in a way that is relavent both to
theoretical jargon and practical comparative needs. (54)

Equality/Inequality in Production: A False Dichotomy.

While recent theoretical and empirical insights on the evolution of hunter-gatherer/egalitarian
societies have broadened our view of the variation in production in these societies, little attention
has been given to the material variables embedded in the social relations of production. This paper
identifies and examines variables that people manipulate in subsistence production, and considers
the consequences of these actions for mediating and maintaining unequal demands on individuals’
surplus labor. This approach is then applied to the prehistoric Northeast and offers new ways to
understand the social dynamics of intensifying food production in these societies and in non-stratified
societies in general. (49)

A Consideration of Woodland Settlement Variability in the Prairie Peninsula.

Varying resource potential has long been posited as underlying Woodland settlement variability in
the Prairie Peninsula. Vital to full validation of this position are pan-regional comparisons of ecological
variability and settlement systems. Broad trends in ecological variability across the Prairie Peninsula
are presented and foraging models are employed to predict settlement configurations. The predicted
configurations are then compared with available data on settlement systems in river valleys from
Michigan to Kansas. Change in settlement is also discussed. (33)

Holocene Environments and Settlement at Tel Lachish, Israel.

Alluvial sequences in central Israel reveal a history of climatic and landscape changes from Chal-
colithic through Byzantine times. These are closely related to social and historical events at Tel
Lachish. The deposits indicate a moister climate during initial settlement in the Chalcolithic period.
Rapid floodplain buildup in the Middle Bronze I suggests an instability in the drainage system
corresponding to widespread abandonment of cities. A dry period of wadi incision followed until the
deposition of colluvium in the Late Iron Age, apparently from neglected agricultural terraces following
the Assyrian destruction of Israelite Lachish. A later All accompanied Byzantine settlement. (55)

The Origins of Pastoral Nomadism in the N egev Desert, Israel.

Intensive survey and test excavations indicate that the introduction of pastoral economies in the
sbuthern desert zone of Israel occurred 2000-3000 years after the development of domestication
economies in the heartland. The first evidence of domesticates is not found until the Chalcolithic
period while Neolithic economies in the Negev were based on intensive hunting and gathering. The
Early Bronze Age showed a fluorescence of pastoral nomadism. The evolution of pastoralism can be
related to the “secondary products revolution”, and to the establishment of economic ties with the
villages and cities of the North. (55)

Innovation and Constraints: Factors Influencing Iroquois Carving Style.

A number of factors influence the development of individual and local stylistic variation in Iroquois
mask carving, While a survey of the literature shows previous interpretations emphasizing religion,
other social and psychological factors interact systematically to affect decision making in the carving
process and artistic license. The three primary bases for artistic decision making are discussed: (1}
religious factors, including mythological characters; (2) social factors, including culture change, the
Seneca Arts Project, commercialization, etc.; and (3} psychological factors, including the complex
interaction between patron, carver, and public expectation. (16)

An Early Interior Site in Southwestern Oregon.

Results of several years of investigations by Oregon State University archaeologists suggest strong
interior influences and use in the coastal environment of southwestern Oregon at least 3000 years
ago. Materials recovered from recent excavations at the deeply stratified Marial site 60 miles upriver
along the Rogue River show compelling similarities with the 3000 year old non-marine coastal sites,
, Saitta, Dean J. 131
plus a well established interior culture at 7000 years with strong similarities to the later coastal sites.
Deep levels at the Marial site have yielded material dating in the 8000-9000 year range. (40)

Faunal Insights from Modern Food Remains.

A pilot garbage project was conducted in New York City last year to evaluate relative compliance
with a recent bottle-return bill in several neighborhoods differing with respect to socio-economic and
population composition variables. A second type of analysis was directed towards the recovery of
information on food consumption. The effect of income, ethnicity, and population density on archae-
ologically recoverable food remains are described, using ratios of fresh to processed food, and foods
leaving archaeological remains to those leaving none. Interpretations are offered for prehistoric and
historic research as well as contemporary situations. (7)

A Palynological Analysis of Human Impact in the Copan Valley.

Soil and sediment samples from a set of loci in the Copan Valley, Honduras, including two "aguadas”
or swampy areas and two caves, among others, are analyzed palynologically to elucidate information
on questions dealing with human impact on the environment and agricultural systems. Such research
pursuits include the beginnings of land clearance, differential land use within the region, the nature
of agricultural systems generally, and the abandonment of agricultural lands with the Classic Maya
collapse. Such explanations shed further light on broader themes in Maya cultural evolution. (1)

Uithic Evidence for Wanka Household Response to the Imposed Inka State Economy.

The Wanka, a central Peruvian Andean chiefdom, was conquered by the Inka state in A-D. 1471.
Strong economic change occurred in terms of demands made by the Inka and new economic oppor-
tanities available to the local population. Analysis of change is made with evidence of stone tool
production and use at the household level. Changes in production and use resulting from Inka demands
es well as potential increased market opportunity are considered. Evidence for change in the organi-
sstion and intensity of tool production as well as the subsequent use of tools in craft and subsistence
production is presented. |10)

Mound-Building as Material Symbolism: An Example from the Western Ozark Highland.

Excavations at several Mississippi Period mound centers in the western Ozark Highland of Arkansas,
Missouri, and Oklahoma indicate a consistent pattern of ceremonial mound construction. Elements
ef this pattern go beyond the basic engineering requirements of earthwork construction and include
wech features as intentional use of varied sediment colors and textures, specialized treatment of
‘sexstruction surfaces, and maintenance of spatial arrangements among stratifigraphically discrete
feetares. When evaluated in relation to ethnographic data on Southeastern Indian cosmology and

sremonialism, mound-building in this region appears as one means by which prehistoric Indians

materially expressed key elements of their cosmology. (34)

The Concept of “Surplus” Production: Its Status and Effects within Alternative Theories of Non-

Seratified Society.

The concept of ‘surplus’ production is frequently invoked by archaeologists to account fora variety
et phenomena in non-stratified societies including changes in the division of labor and the rise of
social asymmetry. This paper critiques conventional usage of the surplus concept and demonstrates
, 132 Salwen, B.
how it has constrained our understanding of social and economic change. An alternative conceptual-
ization is offered in which surplus is viewed not as excess product but rather as a complex relationship
between labor and the host of social conditions organizing its extraction and distribution. The
implications of this understanding for problem formulations of social process and change in prehistory
are illustrated. (49)

Animal Use in Andean Wanka-Inka Households: Changes in the Subsistence Economy.

Analysis of animal bone from Wanka sites indicates differential use in elite and commoner house-
holds that became more pronounced following Inka conquest. Overall little evidence exists for direct
intervention by the state in camelid herding. After the conquest, the diets of the elite included more
camelid and deer, while commoners shifted meat use to dogs and guinea pigs. An increase of mica in
elite households may reflect differential access ta food grains. A decrease in water-dependent species
may suggest increased aridity in Wanka III, perhaps the result of induced environmental changes. (10)

A Quantitative Measure of Urbanization at Copan.

An absorbing topic in Maya archaeology continues to be that of the nature of Classic Maya centers—
their political, religious, and economic functions. Most particularly the debate has focused on whether
they had fully evolved urban characteristics and can be considered cities. In this paper urbanization
is viewed as a process and a quantitative approach is used to measure this process at Copan. The data
base is generated from large-scale excavations of house compounds and regional surface survey. |1)

Occupational Specialization on the Late Prehispanic Andean Coast.

Ethnohistoric evidence for the socioeconomic organization of the Andean coast during the final
prehispanic periods differs significantly from the widely-used ‘‘yerticality” model derived principally
from highland sources, Documentary evidence for the coast suggests that political units were divided
into distinct, occupationally specialized residentially discrete and possibly endogamous socioeco-
nomie-subunits. One of the clearest cases is the valley of Chincha, where preliminary results from
archaeological excavations confirm the documentary records of a settlement of specialized fishermen

« Who traded dried and salted fish for non-marine resources, principally plant foods but also metal,
textiles, and ceramics. (42)

The Structure of the Classic Obsidian Production-Distribution at Matacapan, Tuxtlas Region, Vera-

Recent investigations at Matacapan in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz have attempted
to characterize both the Teotihuacan presence and the Classic period obsidian production-distribution
system in the community. The 6,000-plus controlled surface collections and 83 stratigraphic exca-
vations-provide data which indicate marked changes in the structure of the Middle and Late Classic
obsidian production-distribution systems. Changes occurred in the ways obsidian was exchanged over
long distances, the source deposits which were utilized, the production technology, and the functional
usage. It is evident that the long distance distribution systems organized by Teotihuacan and its
successor Tula differed in significant ways. (20)

What You See Is What You Get: Is Surface Survey Sufficient for CRM?

In most CRM projects, surface surveys provide the exclusive source of information used to describe
and evaluate the resource base. By considering a variety of regional-scale formation processes, this
paper disputes the adequacy of contemporary surface surveys to provide a complete characterization
of the archaeological resource base, even in areas where field conditions are optimal. Recent CRM
projects in the American Southwest are used to illustrate these arguments. Advice is offered. on how
to devise better survey strategies. (26)

Population Change in the Dolores Area, A.D. 600-1125.

Changes in several Dolores population parameters are predicted from analysis of local and regional
climatic characteristics between A.D. 600-1175. Increasing population size is expected when dry
arming was possible in the Dolores area and in the region. Increases in growth rate, migration rate,
site longevity, density and coresidential group size are expected when farming was possible only in
the Dolores area. Archaeological estimates of population size, site longevity, site size and density,
patterns of population growth in the surrounding region, and proportion of nonlocal materials in
household artifact inventories, are used to evaluate predictions. (44)

Variability in Ceramic Function and Assemblages.

The ratio of a ceramic vessel’s maximum height and minimum diameter |H/D) most reliably predicts
primary function, Using this ratio asa standard, variability in vessel function can be assessed. Ceramic
assemblages are collections of vessels, and can be characterized by the number of vessels having H/
D ratios within certain increments. Several basic types of assemblages are identified by using ethno-
graphic and archaeological examples. Consideration of assemblage QQtypes has implications for
monitoring site function, ranges of functions that vessels perform, the role of aceramic containers,
2nd food preparation strategies. (27)

Symboling in Archaeology: Towards a More Humanistic Science.

The paradigms of Western archaeology are ideological mystifications that obscure and transform
istorical consciousness in non-Western cultures. Structural analysis of contemporary archaeology
seweals that the definition of research problems perpetuates a dominant ideology that obscures indig-
emous history. Moreover, the processes of reasoning employed at the level of interpretation and in
ethnoarchacology are transformational. The recognition that archaeologists symbol in their theoret-
sca! stances and practice of archaeology compels self reflection and a move towards a more humanistic
‘semace; one that begins to deconstruct the paradigms and symbols that continue to mystify history

which were applied are presented to refute this position. The related question of credibility is then
eddsessed, with attention to the issue of the adequacy of this evidence to support the behavioral
eeference of maize cultivation. It is argued that adequacy must be judged in this case on principles
whech are more commonly employed in paleontology than in archaeology, and may seem contrary to
those we normally apply. (33)

Eden’s Forbiddden Fruit? Plant Food Foraging Opportunities in East African Habitats.

The opportunities for a hominid to forage for plant foods would be affected by: (1) the nutritional
properties of the plant foods, (2) plant food harvestability, (3) plant food distribution within and
between micro-habitats, and (4) plant food seasonal availability. Recent field surveys have documented
these attributes of plant food feeding opportunity near rivers in semi-arid Kenya. Transect data and
harvesting experiments provide a basis from which to develop models of early hominid diet breadth
and foraging strategies, and the relative importance of plant and animal foods in early hominid diets.

Community-Wide Lithic Craft Specialization in the Late Preclassic Lowland Maya: A Case for North-

This paper examines the evidience for Lowland Maya community-wide craft specialization in the
lithic craft production in the Late Preclassic and Late Classic settlements of Colha, Belize. This
development of lithic specialization is attributed to several factors, among them the localized occur-
rence of high quality cherts. Is this archaeological expression of community-wide craft specialization
unique in the lowlands or does it simply represent a more visible indication of economic complexity
in the region beginning in the Late Preclassic and reaching an apogee in the Late Classic period? (54)

Ceramic Vessels and Site Variability.

Archaeologists who study human settlement must understand the range of site types that make up
a settlement system. Toward this end, we commonly compare sites along the dimension of size,

~architectural complexity, floral and faunal remains, production vs. consumption of goods, represen-
tation of exotic items, and burial furniture. Another important indicator of site variability is the
« __ frequency of ceramic vessel classes at each site. Analysis of vessel size and shape can provide data to
address questions about relative site permanence, relative size of groups for whom food was prepared,
and degree of site specialization. Archaeological examples are presented. (27)

Demographic Aspects of Elite Honseholds in Late Classic Copan.

A continuing debate in Maya archaeology has revolved around the demographic structure of Late

at Copan, represented by Patio Group 9M-22-A. Population estimates are generated for this patio
group for each of a series of time-spans during the Late Classic Coner Phase. These population
estimates are then compared with other excayated patio groups in the densely occupied zone of
Sepultura. Finally, the implications this demographic profile holds for interpreting the demography
of other patio groups at Copan and other Maya centers is discussed. (1]

The bone tools from the Wallace Ruin are described. Manufacturing processes and potential tool
uses are examined. The technology is similar to that found in other Anasazi sites, except that the

Zooarchaeology of the North Highlands of Peru: Early Horizon to Late Intermediate.

Fauna) data from the 1979 and 1982 excavations of the University of Tokyo Expedition in the

several sites of different character and environmental setting representing over 2000 years of prehistory
= the Cajamarca Basin (Early Horizon to Late Intermediate). An abrupt shift from deer to domesticated
camelids (probably in the Late Early Horizon) in Cajamarca contrasts with more gradual shifts noted
elsewhere (e.g. Kotosh and Chavin de Huantar). Also zooarchaeological data from the Basin must be
seen in light of probable exploitation of the yunga zone and contact with North Coastal polities. (42)

Shell Midden Site Formation.

Shell midden sites on the coast of Maine are constructed from the deposition of exploited mollusc
remains which reflect changing environmental conditions and seasons of occupation. Documentation
of the prehistoric settlement patterns are evaluated through the analysis of four hypotheses: (1) sites
consist of functionally discrete activity areas, (2) large sites are inhabited by groups who occupy a
segment of the total area available, (3) sites are utilized during specific seasons, and (4) there is great
potential for post-depostional disturbance which may alter or obscure site formation processes. (12)

An Examination of the Potential Use of Phosphorus of Soils as an Archaeological Survey Tool.

The possibility of utilizing phosphorus analysis as a tool for archaeological survey has been exam-
ined. Soil samples from settlementaffected and sterile soils were subjected to phosphorus determi-
nation by four different chemical fractionation procedures. The perchloric acid digestion procedure
was determined the best indicator of anthrosols. Employing this method, variations in the phosphorus
content of soils as an indicator of abandoned settlements was evaluated. Results indicated that
Variations in phosporus values inter-regionally may denote the presence of abandoned settlement
loci. However, the utility of variations in phosphorus to delineate the vertical or horizontal boundaries
of cultural deposits is limited. (2)

Increases in status differentiation in a non-stratified society affect the Organization of production,
consumption, and distribution. Archaeological remains from the Early and Middle Woodland periods
in southern Ohio (Adena, Hopewell) provide an example of this type of social change. Adena and
Hopewell remains consist primarily of mortuary sites. At these sites, an increase in status differen-
tiation is indicated by increases in quantity and changes in type of grave goods that reflect high status,
The economic implications of these changes in terms of procurement, production, and final distri-
bution of these high status goods are considered. (49)

A Lowland Tropical Dietary Pattern.

From Honduras to the middle Orinoco region of Venezuela, prehistoric people utilized the same
several species of food plants at all lowland tropical sites so far excavated with plant remains recovery.
The greatest bulk of recovered plant material is palm endocarp and kernel, probably largely from
coyol |Acrocomia). This is accompanied by seeds of a number of fruits. Early levels in Venezuela
(2500 B.C.) and Panama (5000 B.C.) are pre-maize, but recoveries in Costa Rica (2500 B.C.) and
Honduras (A.D. 1000?) are with maize. In all areas, after the introduction of maize, palm remains a
significant part of the plant remains, None of the tree crops display morphological changes which
signal cultivation, but all are cultivated today. (40)

The Archaeology of Social Stratification: Measuring Wealth from Household Artifacts.

Archaeologists have traditionally used two lines of evidence to infer the existence and nature of
prehistoric social stratification—burials and architecture. This paper examines a neglected third line
, Spink, Mary L. 137
of evidence—household artifacts. Ethnographic descriptions of stratification systems are used ta
develop a series of artifactual correlates of differing levels of wealth and differing access to basic
resources, Specific wealth-related distinctions are discussed for the realms of tools and technology,
diet and food preparation, food serving, household religious activity, and luxury or status objects.
Several general properties of artifacts and assemblages that reflect wealth differences are discussed,
including quality, diversity and place of origin. Consideration is also given to the role of formation
processes in determining the degree to which wealth differences are expressed in household artifact
inventories. General and specific points are illustrated with ethnographic and archaeological exam-
ples. (2)

Prehistoric Exploration Practices and Paleoenvironments on San Miguel Island, California.

Statistical analysis of shellfish remains from column samples collected on San Miguel Island has
revealed that certain species tend to covary with each other. The shellfish species in one cluster
enhabit today the intertidal zone, whereas those in another cluster are principally subtidal. To account
tor changes in the prevalence of different clusters, hypotheses are considered which relate the changes
to shifts in exploitation patterns or alternatively to fluctuations in sea temperatures. (59)

Upper Paleolithic Connubia, Refugia, and the Archaeological Record East of the Carpathians.

Broad temporal and spatial perspectives predominantly on the Upper Paleolithic record of Western
and Northwestern Europe have recently led researchers to postulate pan-continental spheres of inter-
ections as well as large-scale population movements. The rich archaeological record of Eastern and
Central Europe (USSR and Czechoslovakia) will be used to evaluate these hypotheses as well as to
offer an Eastern” perspective on the archaeological data from Late Pleistocene Europe before, during,

The Shanidar Cave Protoneolithic Cemetery and its Implications.

A small cemetery belonging to the Protoneolithic period (Zawi Chemi Shanidar/Karim Shahir
Culture) dating from ca. 10,800 B.P., found in Shanidar Cave, Iraq, provides us with behavioral
comparisons with the contemporary Natufian culture of the Levant. The cemetery so far excavated
contained 31 individuals in some 26 graves, encompassed in part by a low stone wail. Fire was used

Farmers and Hunters: Interdependence Among Non-Stratified Societies.

fererdependent relations between hunter-gatherers and horticulturalists often result from the reg-
eller exchange of resources. A model based on ecological models of mutualism is offered to explain:
(1) the advantages to a certain degree of specialization in resource production and exchange, and (2)
the conditions which select for the development of interdependent relations. Mutualistic relations
open several evolutionary paths for interacting populations; (1) hunter-gatherers may adopt agricul-
tare, (2) horticultuyflists may become full-time hunter-gatherers, or (3) specialization on the part of
sme or both populations may increase. The conditions under which each of these trajectories is
expected to be followed are discussed. (49)

Hunter-Gatherer Settlement Strategies: A Regional Perspective on Intra-Site Spatial Analysis.

Current approaches to intra-site spatial structure tend to focus on the reconstruction of activities
at single sites. When viewed from a regional perspective, however, the limitations of conventional
analyses become evident. This paper reviews reconstructionist approaches (especially quantitative
ones) noting both the difficulties in decomposing the archeological record into identifiable events and
the inappropriateness of the resulting units in testing regional models of hunter-gatherer settlement
strategies. An alternative approach is outlined which emphasizes measures of the spatial dimension
which can be directly applied across sites in a region, Differential depostional environments in a
region are also considered. Data collected from the lower Illinois Valley are used to address these
issues. (47)

Household Domestic Areas, Moquegua Valley, Southern Peru.

This paper reports on recently completed excavations in the Moquegua Valley of southern Peru in
which complete rooms were the basic excavation unit and identification of total household domestic
areas was a principal research objective. The excavations spanned a time period from Tiwanaku 5
{Expansive} to Inka in a circumscribed settlement system at approximatiely 2500 meters above sea
level, This paper contrasts two sequential, pre-Inka/post-Tiwanaku phases demonstrating: (1) activity
areas within such households; (2) archaeological correlates of such activities; (3) the nature of house-
hold change resulting from increased nucleation, increased population density, and non-agricultural
economic restructurings and; (4) linkages between these sierra sites and altiplano communities. (48}

Recognition of Taphonomic Provenience as an Aid for Idenyilying Agents Causing Bone Modification.

Two goals in taphonomic studies are to understand the processes which create bone assemblages,
and to identify agents causing specific forms of bone modification, Attaining these goals is difficult,
however, because several taphonomic agents create similar patterns of bone reduction and distribu-
tion. In instances where more than one agent may have caused the distribution or reduction of bone
the recognition of the context in which the action occurred may help to identify the taphonomic
agent acting upon the bone. To facilitate the use of context in these taphonomic studies the concepts
of primary and secondary taphonomic provenience are developed. (7}

Facies in Shell Middens.

Artifacts and ecofacts, discovered within archaeological deposits, are usually the major targets in
archaeological recovery techniques. If these artifacts are found in low densities within a matrix
composed predominantly of mineral sediment, then the principal strategy of the excavation is simply
to locate and separate the artifacts and ecofacts from the sediment, In shell middens the matrix
enveloping the artifacts is often ecofactual material instead of mineral sediment. The mechanics of
excavating middens are particularly challenging because there is no component of the record that can
be legitimately discarded. The research staff of the San Juan [sland Archaeological Project has devised
an excavation strategy that records the location of artifacts, quantifies their volume, and identifies
the varieties of the surrounding ecofacts, utilizing the concept of facies. (12)

Settlement Plan and Community Interaction.

Settlement layout affects the flow of movement within a residential community and enhances or
schibits social interaction. Building locations as well as external space impose measurable limits on
the degree to which social contact can occur. Spatial qualities that promote social activity include
the uniformity, proximity, and accessibility of facilities and communal areas. Those qualities that
sphibit it include distance and the presence of physical barners. Settlement plans from small Missis-
sippian sites in southern Illinois demonstrate the close relationship between settlement layout and
the potential for social interaction among community residents. (24)

Lithic Refuse Disposal Patterns: An Archaeolgoical Study.

Recent ethnoarchaeological studies examine the relationship between intra-site spatial organization
of activities and refuse disposal, Archaeological data from Nawthis Village, Utah, are used to test a
model of lithic debitage refuse types and distribution patterns. Analyses focus on reduction stage,
ize, and association with features. Results support the propositions: (1) inside structures, large items
ec near walls and small items are near hearths; and (2) outside structures, larger items occur away

tom structures and features. Small items, however, are predominant in exterior peripheral areas. It
‘ss proposed that the spatial patterning results from two combined disposal strategies and relates to
Giferential intensities of spatial use. (8)

Seandoughs and Cheechakos: The Emergence of Ethnic Identity Among Non-Sedentary Populations.

A theory for the emergence of ethnic identity among non-sedentary populations is constructed with
seterence to two historic gold rush sites in the southwest Yukon. The role of material culture in the
emetgence and maintenance of ethnic identity is examined, and the conditions under which ethnicity
& likely to emerge are considered. These conditions may be met in numerous diverse settings,
ecbuding Altamira, a hypothesized Upper Paleolithic campsite in Cantabrian, Spain. The Altamira
Gets és reevaluated in light of this theory, and it is posited that it is the construction and use of new
sepbstic elements on engraved bone, not the diversity of such designs (Conkey 1980), that suggest
ec Alramira was an aggregation site. It is at the point of understanding how and why ethnic
teeandaries initially emerge that McQuire’s (1982) theory on the likelihood of their persistence
Secumes most useful. (2)

A domestic structure and a possible activity area were found in the deeper levels of the preceramic
midden where refuse accumulated on sterile sand between 8170-9800 B.P. A circular wall trench and
pits intruded into sterile soil, and a hearth and several larger artifacts were associated with the intrusive
features. This pattern of associations distinguished the Las Vegas type site from smaller Vegas sites
and is the basis for an interpretation of Las Vegas household economy. (48)

« Implications of Population Thinking and Middle Range Theory.

Traditional anthropological models of the evolution of culture are founded in an essentialist ontol-
ogy. In contrast, populationist thinking—which underlies Neo-Darwinian theory—emphasizes phen-
otypic variation within populations upon which selection operates. The use of systems-theoretic
approaches has hindered development of population-scale models of adaptation, as well as middle
range theory needed to test these models against archaeological phenomena. Models of regional
settlement and subsistence are explored using data from a multicomponent site in the Pacific North-
west Coast region. (17)

Camp Miller: The Excavation and Interpretation of an 1867 Army Field Camp in Arizona.

Camp Miller, an army field camp occupied for one month in 1867 was located through the use of
historical Army documents, terrain analysis and metal detectors. The camp's original layout was
reconstructed by mapping each individual artifact recoverd by the detectors. Three major activity
areas; kitchen, bivouac, and train (supplies) were discovered. The camp's layout differed dramatically
from the layout prescribed in the 1861 U.S. Army Regulations. As military field camps are rarely
discussed in either the historical or archaeological literature, the analysis and interpretations of Camp
Miller will aid in future research on frontier army field activity. (30)

The Importance of Ethnoastronomy to Archaeo-astronomy in the Maya Area.

Archaeoastronomy has previously focused almost exclusively on solar phenomena. Ethnoastron-

a large fund of previously untapped astronomical information which is of importance both to astron-
omers and archaeologists, and which continues to be applied in Mayan agricultural practice and
midwifery today, (51)

Causal Pathways and Causal Processes: A Populationist View of Human Diversity in Time and Space.

Understanding variation in language, customs, and human biology from place to place and from
one time to another can be called a process of apportioning elements of human diversity to chance,
history, and adaptation. The populationist view is a way of thinking about the past and the causal
pathways leading to the present that builds on the modem definition of science as a continuous
dialogue with Nature (including the world as human artifice} joining human imagination with logical
and empirical methods of evaluation. How this point of view is restructuring our understanding of
Pacific prehistory is illustrated by reference to the question of ‘Polynesian origins.” (17)

to 1,8-2.1 m in depth. Radiocarbon dates on select cultural features and natural strata provide an
absolute chronology of sediment deposition at the site. Various detailed geological analyses of the
sediments and their chemical constituents are reported. These analyses are related to the varying
episodes of human occupation and changing depostitional regimes in the local riverine system during
the entire span of the Holocene. (33)

Contemporary archaeology emphasizes the variability in past adaptive and positioning strategies.
Unlike traditional views of hunter-gatherer society (which tended to isolate discrete modal types),

Strategies, and focus is shifting toward analysis of entire sites. Such inquiry is greatly enhanced by
recent advances in remote sensing technology. (14)

Is There Cultural Interaction without Trade?

The cultural patterning characteristic of inter-regional cultural interaction is an outgrowth of a
distinct kind of trading relationship. Much more than an epiphenomenon of inter-group trade, inter-
action can be more appropriately regarded as indicative of the presence of inter-group trade among
settled, but relatively dispersed groups. In the context of the Hopewellian case, interaction is shown
to have thrived in the absence of high volume trade and to have been based on the joint participation
of peoples from widely separated regions in inter-group ceremonies. These participants are argued to
be based on mutual advantages. (23)

of metric variability in a large body of ceramics from Chaco makes it likely that some villages made

Archaeology and American Society.

Although EuroAmerican society has viewed itself as a melting pot, native Americanas have remained
excluded from it both socially and symbolically. The dominant society initially perceived the archae-
ological remains of the native Americans as those of an inferior, static, and vanishing world. Growing
evidence of change in prehistoric times recovered during the early 20th century did not produce a
significantly more positive view of their creative potential, Despite growing concern with heritage
conservation and the stress that processual archaeology has laid upon the internal dynamism of native
American cultures, the archaeological record continues to be treated as the alienated heritage of a
living people. (14)

The Organization of Production in the Prehistory of Southeast Europe.

The investigation of the household as the unit of production has become a frequent focus of research
into non-stratified societies. This paper discusses the dangers inherent in the investigation of the role
of the household in socioeconomic change in prehistory when its reconstruction must be carried out
at a level of inference far removed from the archaeological data itself. The paper proposes the use of
“units of production”, based more directly on observations of the archaeological data, in the recon-
struction of socioeconomic transformation of prehistoric societies. Using such units, evidence is
presented for the transformation of social reproduction in the 3000 year period of the Neolithic-Early

This paper-reviews several existing problems in the ceramic typology and chronology of the Early
Postclassic period. Although the Colha Postclassic pottery has been questioned recently in terms of
itg temporal placement, we feel secure in our present designation. Our research and analysis of the
Postclassic ceramics are presented to substantiate the present interpretations. The data for this study,
derived primarily from the Postclassic pottery at Colha, is then reviewed with reference to other
Postclassic collections from Belize, Guatemala, and Yucatan. Future studies of the Postclassic mate-
rials from Colha are also posited as a means of further testing our findings. (54)

Potential of Microartifacts other than Microdebitage.

Microdebitage, recognizable lithic debitage less than 1 mm in size, has been used since 1982. But
there is great information potential from other types of recognizable human debris in the same size
range: microartifacts in the broad sense. This paper presents some of the other possible artifacts:
microflakes and microchunks, but also microsherds and historic microartifacts, It discusses recog-
nition criteria, evidence for human origin, and case studies in which they have been used. The paper
also briefly presents the numerical methods by which these microartifact counts can be made com-
parable with macroartifact counts, and again a case example. (8)

External Economies and Plains Village Adaptations.

Traditional discussions of external economic activities among Plains Village populations have
stressed village self-sufficiency along with an individual-based external exchange composed primarily
of food-stuffs. Recent research has indicated that this view may be inaccurate and that specialized
external economies may have been impor, tant aspects of southern Plains Late Prehistoric adaptations.

That evidence will be reviewed and the importance of external economies to southern Plains Late
Prehistoric populations will be addressed through a detailed consideration of one of those economies. |

Archaic Hunter-Gatherer Mobility Strategies in Northwestern New Mexico.

Although a regional perspective for the study of past cultural systems has been advocated, there |
have been few attempts to identify regional hunter-gatherer mobility patterns. If lithic raw materials |
are collected incidentally during subsistence related movement (cf. Binford 1979}, then the presence
of nonlocal lithic types may provide a means for viewing tranhumance patterns. Ethnographic data |
on the sizes of known hunter-gatherer annual ranges and overall territories, are compared with the
distribution of intrusive material types on Archaic sites in northwestern New Mexico, to provide a
perspective on regional land use patterns. (38) :

Archaeological Measures of Varying Forager-Collector Strategies. |

It has been recognized that hunters and gatherers employ a variety of short and long term adaptation
strategies to survive in their environ,ments. The distinction between foragers and collectors has
proven to be a useful concept for characterizing hunter-gatherer subsistence-settlement systems. This |
paper attempts to show how assemblage composi,tion, inter- and intra-site structure can be used to
construct useful measures to monitor the dynamics of varying mixes of forager-collector strategies
and changes in subsistence-settlement patterns. Both ethnographic and archaeological examples will
be presented. (47)

Ecology of Root Use in Northern Tanzania.

Determination of the possible feeding opportunity of roots for early hominids can be studied on
three levels; (1) the number of root species in general savanna and forest habitats may show the
preferred habitats of this food source, (2) vegetation surveys in selected savanna habitats can reveal
typical densities for this food source; and (3) detailed study of root use by the Hadza tribe of hunter-
eatherers can show the level of exploitation that this food source can withstand, and its contribution
to the overall diet. (37)

On the Relationships of Formal Models and Archaeological Theory: The Outlines of an Epistemology.

The status of formal and mathematical models in archaeology is discussed, Differences in the

Seylistic Change as a Function of Social Identity.

Archaeological models of stylistic behavior commonly utilize an implicit, static, and often sim-
plsstic understanding of individual social identity. As developed in this paper, a model of style which
employs social identity as a central explanatory concept provides a synthesis for previous models of
seyle; emphasizes the dynamic component of style; and considers style in specifically archaeological
‘ems as a cultural feature linking the contexts of artifact manufacture, use, and deposition. Test
s=qplications derived from this model are assessed through the analysis of the design variability of
ceramics from the early historic period in the American Southeast. (16)

specifically on two aspects of the production process—the organization of labor and labor invest-

not at all egalitarian in the organization of production, providing a dialectic for change and variation
through time. (49)

Comparability Among Recovery Techniques.

Dry screening, water screening, and flotation are three commonly used recovery techniques that
result in different kinds and amounts of artifacts. The use of any one of these techniques biases not
only for the recovery of particular artifacts, but also against certain artifacts and can create a data
base that is inadequate or misleading for answering the researcher's questions. As a result, compara-
bility of data among sites has become a major interpretive problem. This paper presents examples of
differences among recovery techniques and suggests methodological, analytic, and interpretive approaches
to handling comparability of materials recoverd by different recovery techniques. (53)

Geomorphological Processes and the Integrity of Archaeological Remains in Dune Fields.

In order that the archaeological record be used most efficiently and fully, archaeologists must be
concerned with the various natural processes which affect differentially the integrity of archaeological

paper presents the preliminary results of another field experiment conducted in stable and active
dune fields of New Mexico, Implications for evaluating the integrity of the surficial archaeological
record are given. (26)

The Sulphur Springs Phase and Early New World Prehistory.

The Sulphur Springs phase of the Cochise Culture of southeastern Arizona has been a source of
controversy for five decades. Geoarchaeological investigations of Whitewater Draw do not substan-
tiate the claim that Sulphur Springs phase ground stone artifacts are associated with extinct mega-
fauna, nor the hypothesis that Sulphur Springs phase artifacts are specialized plant processing tools
of the Clovis Culture. Instead, radiocarbon dates from Whitewater Draw place the Sulphur Springs
phase between 8,000-10,000 B.P., and possibly to 10,400 B.P. Evidence suggests that the Sulphur

‘ Springs people did not temporally overlap with Pleistocene megafauna except possibly during the
terminal Pleistocene. (35)

Archaeological Interpretation 1985.

Archaeology is the only historical science that destroys its primary data in the process of recovering
them. Hence, there has always been—and should always be—deep concern about the archaeological
recording techniques and about the interpretation of archaeological data. The interpretive goals
explicitly and implicitly sought by Americanist archaeologists vary significantly from individual to
individual. At the disciplinary level they have also changed markedly over the past 50 years, In this
paper I discuss some aspects of archaeological interpretation in the abstract, and then compare
interpretive themes or schools in Americanist Archaeology ranging from archaeology as chronicle to
archaeology as fable and metaphor. (14)

Late Prehistoric Rock Shelters along the Canadian River, San Miguel County, New Mexico.

Archaeological fieldwork on the Chappell-Spade Ranch northeast of Tucumcari, New Mexico, has
documented the presence of numerous rock shelter habitation structures constructed under overhangs
of large free standing boulders and against cliff faces. Radiocarbon dating of charcoal from enclosed
hearths assigns these structures to a late Early Plains Village (A.D. 1100-1450) temporal position.
Floral, faunal, ceramic, and lithic asemblages indicate widespread contact to the east and west. The
assemblage does not permit a clear assignment to any of the surrounding cultural foci of Texas or
southern Colorado; however, alternative interpretations are presented, (45)

Environmental Causality in Hohokam Archaeology: A Reassessment.

On the basis of recent data from contract work in the Phoenix Basin, and the Northern and Southern
Peripheries, an environmental causality model for Hohokam, originally presented by the author in
1972, is reassessed. The resulting reassessment provides a pan-regional model for the Sedentary-
Classic transition, subsequent development in the Classic period, and the Classic-Protohistoric tran-
sition. With emphasis placed on viewing the Hohokam as a regional system with associated exchanges
of material items as well as ideas, environmental change, both natural and man-made, remains a
strong possibility as a primary triggering mechanism for Hohokam cultural change. (58)

The Extent to which Faunal Remains in European Middle Paleolithic Cave Sites Reflect Human
Activity: An Essay in Applied Taphonomy.

Work in eastern and southern Africa studying modern taph- onomic processes of skeletal disarti-
culation and body part (non)-preservation, plus studies of non-human carnivore bone modification
practices, has generated considerable data indicating the probable preservation potential of different
skeletal parts in predatory animals and their prey, plus suggestive criteria for distinguishing human
food debris from the activities of other carnivores. Application of these principles to fauna reported
from Neanderthal sites suggests that much of this food debris is the product of non-human carnivore
activity. (7)

Despite 30 years of settlement pattern research in the Maya Lowlands, a major problem remains,
the adequate recovery of information encompass,ing an entire Lowland Maya political domain, This
problem stems from practical problems inherent in rural surveys and from difficulties in defining
boundaries for large political units, Environmental circumstances in the Copan Valley have facilitated
extensive survey over an area of about 130 km2. The rural component of Late Classic Copan can now
be compared with settlement data from the demographic core of the region to provide a more complete

Preceramic Plant Utilization on the Central Coast of Peru:
The Lomas of Paloma.

The preliminary results of archaeobotanical, coprolite, and palynological studies of the central
coastal Peruvian site of Paloma suggest that increasing human utilization between about 7700-5000
BP., degraded the site’s fragile Jomas resources environment, and that this degradation was human-
induced rather than due to climatic factors. The site settlement pattern indicates increasing sedentism,
and a shift to more intensive manipulation of some plants and exploitation of marine resources is
registered. Ultimately, littoral and riverine resources appear to have become emphasized over those
at Jomas and arid floodplain settings with implications for the later emergence of social complexity
outside the Jomas. (42)

Archaic and Hohokam Settlement in the Eastern Tucson Basin.

Although an arbitrarily defined survey universe, a wide variety of archaeological sites are present
im the Rincon Mountain Unit of Saguaro National Monument, Tucson, Arizona. In addition to artifact
scatters and 31 habitation sites, there are rock shelters, masonry structures, large agricultural field
systems, petroglyph locations and lithic quarries. Occupation from Archaic to Classic period Hoho-
kam is in evidence. Archaic sites occur at the mouths of steep canyons. There is little evidence of
early ceramic period occupation. Growth is greatest during the Rincon phase and includes isolated
upland sites. A shift in population centers occurs during the Classic period. (3)

Early Egyptian Cultural Complexity at Kom El-Hisn.

Explanations of the origins of cultural complexity in Egypt are based mainly on epigraphic sources
and mortuary cult data, No rural Old Kingdom towns or villages have ever been systematically
excavated. Excavations in 1984 at Kom el-Hisn in the West Delta provide significant information
about the economic organization of the Old Kingdom, particu, larly regarding agricultural strategies

formation. Analyses of the artifacts suggests substantial alterations in traditional approaches to
Egyptian artifact analyses. (55)

Acculturation in the Upper Middle Missouri Valley as Reflected in Bone Tool Assemblages.

During the process of European contact, the Plains Village peoples of the Upper Middle Missouri
experienced acculturation brought on by epidemic diseases and the introduction of new technology.
This process can be traced through analysis of changes in hone tool assemblages from three carefully
test excavated earth lodge villages located at the mouth of the Knife River. Acculturaltion is reflected
in progressively greater modification of bone tools with metal through time, and the eventual replace-
ment of many bone tool types with metal substitutes. (32)

Bolson of western Texas, and a sample survey in the Quemado area of west-central New Mexico.
Each covered more than 60 square miles, and each recorded hundreds of sites in diverse environmental
zones. Both studies indicate that there are types of settlement systems which lend themselves to
interpretation based on sample surveys. Other settlement systems are argued to be such that inter-
pretation based on sample survey data results in misconceptions of the adaptive strategies which
settlement patterns reflect. (50)

Style, Style Areas, and Southern Sierra Nevada Pictographs.

Recent literature on style emphasizes its importance in the expression of prehistoric group identity,
suggesting that style is adaptive as an active factor in group cohesion. Ethnographic literature indicates
that the manifestation of style is more complex, Ultimately the use of style reduces to cultural-
historical classification, regardless of whether it is defined in cybernetic/communication theory terms
or traditional art historical means. A study of pictographs from the southern Sierra Nevada illustrates
these points. A factor analsyis of 89 pictograph sites provides associational information useful for the
construction of cultural-historical style areas, and the relationship these have with historic linguistic
boundaries. (2)

Much discussion has centered on the extent and nature of Classic Lowland Mayan economic
specialization. However, until recently, data have not been collected to specifically address this
question. Recent investigation at a late Classic Mayan patio group 9N-8 at Copan has yielded data
which provide an initial characterization of the level of specialization. It appears that there is full
time craft specialization in a few residences but this specialization is restricted to high status craft
items for elites, probably related and residing in the same mound group, rather than for market
exchange. (1)

Hohokam Warfare.

As a causative factor in the evolution of Southwestem cultural systems, warfare has often been
suggested and much disputed, but rarely has it been throughly evaluated in a systemic way on a
regional or panregional scale. A recent synthesis of data on Hohokam ballcourts led to the perception
thar their distribution largely contrasts with that of fortified hills, perhaps implying that threat and
counterthreat relations between regional populations had escalated by the Sedentary Period. The
cheoretical plausibility of this hypothesis is evaluated and several ways it may be tested are discussed.
The implications for the interpretation of the Salado phenomenon are also considered. (43)

Prehistoric Health and Adaptation: Paradise Lost?

In several recent publications historians and ethnohistorians have claimed that pre-contact native
American populations were well-nourished, disease-free, and therefore, perfectly adapted to their
environment. Empirical evidence relative to pre-contact health status is available from a rapidly
growing body of paleopathological research, and this evidence is used here to refute the ‘Paradise
Lost” concepts. Data from two Late Woodland sites in the Northeast are presented to docu- ment in
detail the health status of these pre-contact groups. These data are then compared with those of other
studies to synthesize health and adaptation in prehistoric American populations. (2)

Beyond Environmental Explanations of Site Location: The Little River Site in the Oconee Province.

Archaeologists who employ environmental variables as determinants of Mississippian settlement
patterns have met with considerable success. Unfortunately, this success has tended to draw attention
away from other equally important determinants of settlement location. Among these are various
kinds of social and political relationships (trade, competition, and alliance) that must have existed
among societies as complex as were Mississippian chiefdoms, Recognition of a single late Mississip-
pian polity in the Georgia Piedmont provides an opportunity to examine extra-environmental aspects
of these societies. Excavations at the Little River site in 1984 were designed to address these aspects
of Mississippian organization. (34)

tha kilometer-long scatter on the shoreline of now-dry pluvial Lake Alkali. Geomorphic survey,

Small House Population Dynamics During the Bonito Phase in Chaco Canyon.

A part of what is perceived as the economic, social and political organization of the Chacoan
Phenomenon is dependent upon our estimation of the population present during the height of the
Classic Bonito Phase (A.D. 1050-1100) in Chaco Canyon, northwestern New Mexico. A reexamination
of small site ceramic assmeblages in Chaco through multidimensional scaling techniques, with the
results verified against chronometrically dated ceramic assemblages, has suggested that contrary to
most projections population had leveled off or decreased during the Classic Period. Thus, a population
rise cannot be considered a causal factor in the eventual decline of the Chacoan system. (3)

Optimal Foraging: Diet Breadth in a Stochastic Environment.

Simulation studies using foraging models and stochastic inputs for environmental parameters
indicate that optimal prey choice in an unpredictable environment is like that generated from simple
deterministic models which assume a normative environment. Risk minimizing and efficiency max-
imizing goals appear to have similar behavioral solutions. In the stochastic situation even the optimal
choice entails larger fluctuations in food intake, unless group level sharing occurs. These results
increase confidence in foraging model hypotheses; they extend the models to quantitative analysis of
risk and exchange. (47)

Preceramic Puna-Sierra Interrelationships in the South-Central Andes.

Recent archaeological investigations in the sierra and puna of the Departments of Moquegua, Tacna,
and Puno, southern Peru, have revealed important relationships between sites found in these rwo
major environmental zones. Three lines of evidence form the basis for this interrelationship: |1) lithic
raw materials between the zones, (2) overlap in artifact style and type, and (3) similarities in design
elements of cave and rockshelter art. Although the nature of interrelationship implied by these data
are not yet fully understood, the implications of a series of models concerning human land use during
the preceramic in the south-central Andes—ranging from modified sedentism strategies to complete
trans-humanace models—will be comparetl against the data, to provide a tenative solution to the
question. (28)

Foundation’s Edge: Entrepreneurial Trade and the Development of the Hohokam Classic Period.

The pre-Classic to Classic Period transition within the Hohokam tradition is seen as involving the
behavioral dynamics of participation in regional exchange networks which developed after the end of
the pre-Classic. These networks developed out of the denouement of old monopolies and an increase
in the number of competing population centers and markets, conditions favoring growth in such
peripheral Hohokam areas as the Tonto Basin and development of such distinctive new cultural
traditions as Salado, The rapidity of change seen in the Hohokam core area and its peripheries can
best be explained using a model of punctuated equilibrium and entrepreneurial expansion. (43)

The Impact of Federal Archaeology in the American Midwest.

Implementation of the federal archaeology program has contributed significantly to our understand-

small-scale projects that are ubiquitous in any region of the United States, the Midwest has hosted
several long-term interdisciplinary programs that haye made solid contributions to the study of

incorporated successfully the dictates of federal archaeology into existing comprehensive research
designs. Despite these accomplishments, there are growing problems in the Midwest that if left

The Evolution of Civilization.

During the past quarter century there has been a fruitful interaction between archaeologists’
developing understandings of the evolution of civilizations and their use of intensive regional survey
approaches, We can now begin to evaluate synthetic or multivariate explanations of state and urban
development with a diversity of new regional data from Mexico, Peru, Mesopotamia, and the Indus.
Such an attempt, at minimum, serves to emphasize disparities in the available evidence from each
area, new possibilities for research to increase comparability, and needs for new forms of international
cooperation and funding if such research is to be undertaken. (1 4}

Archaeological Cartography and the Historical Atlas of Canada.

The Historical Atlas of Canada is a three volume atlas focusing on the social and economic history

of Canada which should be available in 1986. Included in Volume I are an introduction to the prehistory

of Canada and 14 maps which pertain to prehistory. These maps consider the following: Early
Paleolndian; Fluted Point People of Southern Ontario; Late PaleoIndian; four chronology maps cov-
ering the periods 8000-4000 B.C., 4000-1000 B.C., 1000 B.C.-A.D. 500, and A.D. 500-European contact;
the peopling of the High Arctic; Trade; Bison Hunters of the Plains; lroquoian Agricultural Settlement;
Exchange Systems on the north coast of British Columbia; Population and Subsistence; and Cosmol-
ogy. The presentation considers various facets of the archaeological cartographic exercise. (22)
Wyckoff, Don G. (Oklahoma Archeological Survey)
The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly: The Impacts of Federal Archaeology in Oklahoma.

Two decades of federally supported archaeological work in Oklahoma have stimulated an array of
results. From 1934 to 1972, such programs supported the discovery and excavation of many threatened
Sites, resulting in substantive information on cultural sequence, assemblage composition, site layouts, |
settlement practices, and chronology. Essentially 99% of this work was accomplished by archaeolo-
gists affiliated with the University of Oklahoma, a factor which contributed to the monolithic, but
effective and productive, management of Oklahoma’s cultural resources. After 1972, the steadily
increasing enforcement of federal environmental protection laws stimulated the florescence of projects
needing archaeological expertise, exceeding that of the few state-employed archaeologists. The increased
role of archaeologists with federal and private agencies contributed to a noticeably decreased quality
and amount of archaeological work, which, in turn, resulted in some shoddy reports, losses of
information, a waste of tax dollars, and a notable alienation of some citizen support for Oklahoma
archacology. But there have been, and are, some projects that have contributed positively, especially
through multi-disciplinary studies of human adaptations to past environments. Axiomatically, these
projects have involved the cooperative effort of federal, state, contracting, and even amateur archae-
ologists who have worked diligently to see that the archaeological resources were responsibly studied.

Stone Too! Function and Social Differentiation in the Mississippian Settlement at Labras Lake,
Hlinois.

| Small Mississippian sites that are dispersed over the American Bottoms are called farmsteads or
hamlets. It is believed that the “‘farmers’’ who inhabited these sites grew the crops that fed the elite
who resided at the temple towns in the Cahokia settlement system. This interpretation is based on |
the distribution of artifacts on the surface of smal! Mississippian sites and on assumptions about tool
function based on morphology. A more detailed investigation of Mississippian social organization
examines the spatial distribution of household units and the activities that are associated with each
unit. Microwear analysis of lithic assemblages from the seven household units at the Labras Lake site ~
provide data that were used to investigate social differentiation at the locality and consider its
relationship to the Cahokia settlement system. (57)

Seasonality and Site Structure Study of the Late Paleolithic from Northeast China.

Two late paleolithic sites were discoverd recently in northeast China, At YianJia Gang, an open-
air campsite dated 22,730+300 B.P., a semi-circle of faunal remains was found surrounding a concen-
tration of organic debris which could be the remains of a windbreak and enclosed living floor.
Anatomical part frequencies and breakage patterns indicate differential utilization of juvenile and
older individuals of horse and bison. At Bulong Shan Cave Site excavators unearthed 250 horses from
strata dated 17,160 B.P. Eruption, wear, and growth patterns in 6000 cheek teeth indicate that most
of the horses were subadults, possibly killed during the summer. Two different adaptive strategies
may have been adopted. (47)

Vegetational Reconstruction Based on Charcoal.

Since archacological charcoal reflects formerly significant floristic elements, it is extremely useful
in reconstructing past vegetation. Contrary to common practice, the nature of its formation, depostion,
and preservation means that charcoal should be interpreted on a presence—absence basis. Grounded
in the intensive sampling of as many fire—related contexts as possible, this approach treats site
charcoal as an assemblage of taxa. The strategy seeks to identify plant communities rather than
positing probably spurious species commonness based on specimen counts. The procedure thus
minimizes interpretational errors due te'cultural selection. The method is illustrated with a Missis-
sippian example from Missouri. (19)
