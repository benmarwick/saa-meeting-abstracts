, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(1) NEW RESEARCH IN SOUTHEASTERN MESOAMERICA.

As research continues in Southeast Mesoamerica, there is a need to reevaluate our ideas concern-
ing the area’s development and role in pan-Mesoamerican prehistory. The view that Southeast Meso-
america developed as a result of responsive adaptation of external cultural influences disregards
evidence of the internal dynamics of a rich and diverse indigenous culture. The papers presented in
this symposium address some of the fundamental unanswered questions concerning the early culture
history of Southeast Mesoamerica and emphasize the internal dynamics of the area.

(2) CRAFT PRODUCTION, IDEA SYSTEMS, AND TEOTIHUACAN SOCIETY.

Many papers deal with the technology and organization of craft production and distribution in
the ancient metropolis of Teotihuacan, including obsidian, ceramics, ground stone, and lapidary
msterials. Others deal with art and symbolism. A common emphasis is the bearing of both craft
production and symbolic representations on the social, political, economic, and religious organization
of the society. Approximately half the papers are based directly on continuing analyses of Teotihuacan
Mapping Project data.

(3) PROGRAMA CONTISUYU: REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN SOUTHERN

PERU.

This symposium reports recent researches carried out by Programa Contisuyu in the Osmore
drainage (Moquegua and Ilo valleys) of southern Peru. Programa Contisuyu is a cooperative Peruvian-
U.S. agreement involving the Peruvian Museum of Health Sciences, the Peruvian National Cultural
Institute, and archaeologists from a number of American universities and museums. This multina-
tional program was organized in Peru to investigate,.conserve, and develop the cultural heritage of
the Osmore region. Participating scholars will discuss their projects in terms of theoretical interests,
culture history, and the long-term goals of the Programa Contisuyu.

(5) PROCESSUAL STUDIES IN ISLAND ARCHAEOLOGY.

The finite borders of island ecosystems and variability between islands have promoted the view
that islands can serve as ‘natural experiments” or “laboratories” for the study of cultural processes.
This perspective provides the common theme from which sociocultural responses to the spatial
arrangement and geographical circumscription of island populations are addressed. Recent studies on
islands distributed throughout the world’s oceans are brought together in this symposium. Individu-
ally, the papers contribute to our understanding of the processes that underlie human mobility and
cultural adaptation; together, they provide a comparative basis for evaluating similarities and differ-
ences in patterns of cultural development.

(7) POSTGLACIAL HUNTER-GATHERERS IN EUROPE.

Changes in human society were witnessed in Europe following the close of the Pleistocene. There
is dramatic evidence for technological innovation, the exploitation of new habitats and species,
imcreasing exchange, sedentism, status diffé&entiation, conflict and territoriality in the context of
growing population and locational constraint. This session will emphasize investigations from the
European Mesolithic to document the conditions, causes, and consequences of the changes. Examples
are taken from Ireland, England, Scotland, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Germany, and the Low Countries.
\8) THE PAST IS THE PRESENT. ‘

There exists a growing concern in American archaeology about how our interpretations of the
past derive from and serve the interests of the present. It is becoming increasingly clear that we must
be explicit about the uses of the past and about the prevalence of presentism in archaeological
interpretation and inquiry. Using the framework of critical theory, this symposium emphasizes case
studies of a range of archaeological issues and interpretations. Such case studies are necessary to
clarify the theoretical and programmatic issues resulting from an examination of how the past is used
to serve the sociopolitical agendas of the present. ’

(9) CULT ARCHAEOLOGY AND CREATIONISM: ASSESSING AND RESPONDING TO

PSEUDOSCIENTIFIC BELIEFS ABOUT THE PAST.

Participants from the fields of archaeology, physical anthropology, sociology, psychology, and
history will assess the levels of, and reasons for, the popularity of cult archaeology (e.g., “ancient
zstronauts”’) and creationism, as well as their impact on archaeologists as educators. Results will be
presented of a study of the acceptance and correlates of these pseudoscientific beliefs among over
1,000 college students at six campuses across the country. Appropriate professional responses to cult
archaeology and creationism, in both the classroom and the public forum, will be discussed.

43
, 44 (10) Current Research in Northwest Mesoamerica
(10) CURRENT RESEARCH IN NORTHWEST MESOAMERICA. .

Northwest Mesoamerica has traditionally been viewed as an area peripheral to the events in the
Mesoamerican heartland, as an area of simple or simplified cultures. It has long been viewed as an
grea intermediate between the high civilizations of Mesoamerica and the agricultural towns of the |
American Southwest. It has become clear that Northwest Mesoamerica was an integral part of the
cultural systems associated with Mesoamerica and the American Southwest. Papers in this sympo-
sium present data which expand current knowledge of the cultural variation which existed within .
Northwest Mesoamerica and the area’s interactions with adjacent regions.

(11) THE CULTURAL ECOLOGY OF PREHISTORIC ANDEAN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS.

The purpose of this symposium is to provide an overview of the kinds of agricultural systems |
and technologies that developed in the Andean region in response to varying environmental and social
factors. The papers will trace the development of agricultural systems in different regions, focusing —
on and contrasting the desertic coastal region and the inter-Andean valleys of Peru and Chile. Both i
synchronic and diachronic aspects of these systems will be discussed in order to provide a coherent
view of the dynamic nature of the relationship between humans, culture and the environment. bh
(13) SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION IN MICRONESIA AND ITS ARCHAEOLOGICAL

EXPRESSIONS.

Micronesia exhibits a diverse group of societies of varying complexity which, while sharing many
basic commonalities, represent particular and sometimes contrastive organizational solutions to
specific island environments. In recent years, archaeologists working in Micronesia have begun to
concern themselves with the nature and degree of social differentiation that emerges in these islands
and the contrasts they represent to other Oceania societies. The contributors in this symposium seek
to examine various aspects of social rank and complexity in Micronesia and their concomitant
archaeological expressions.

(14) SUBSISTENCE IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST.

From the earliest explorers, scholars have recorded plants exploited by native groups. Pioneer
ethnobotanists described edible species, while cultural anthropologists approached subsistence from
environmental, economic, or ecological perspectives. Today the fascination with subsistence contin-
ues as archaeologists study food gathering concerning diet; site and regional settlement pattern;
feature and room function; food processing and storage; and population dynamics. This symposium
addresses several subsistence related problems from the Basketmaker Anasazi through to historic
Tempe populations and geographically from southern Arizona's Hohokam north to the Colorado
Plateau’s Anasazi.

(15) INTERNAL VARIATION AT TEOTIHUACAN: THE ARCHITECTURAL, ARTIFACTUAL

AND SKELETAL EVIDENCE. :

‘ Beginning in the 80's, extensive excavations at Teotihuacan have uncovered vast areas, Sympo-
sium participants present new findings from INAH, UNAM and Penn State Projects. INAH archae-
ologists have focused on the Ciudadela revealing its distinctive ceremonial character, UNAM archae-
ologists have worked in two areas: (1) a Gulf Coast-Maya Barrio discovering a neighborhood of round
structures and foreign artifacts and (2) in the “Old City”’ uncovering occupation of the Patlachique
and Tzacualli phases; the Penn State group excavated an entire apartment compound, recovering
information on burial practices, craft activities and room function. These data provide a base for
studying the internal variability of Teotihuacan society in the Classic Period.
(21) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF WOODLAND ENCLOSURES IN THE MIDCONTINENT.

The papers of this symposium provide a comparative summary of recent work performed at some
Adena, Hopewell and Late Woodland enclosures, with hilltop and valley floor sites among the exam-
ples. Emphasis is placed on questions of architectural form, construction techniques, earthwork
configuration, chronology and site functions, with some papers addressing regularities in earthwork
form and engineering principles behind site layout,

(26) WATER MAN AGEMENT IN THE DESERT WEST.

Availability of water presents the single most critical limiting resource for human occupation of
the Desert West. Prehistoric and historic cultures of this area engaged in a wide range of technologies
for acquisition and management of this resource, including water harvesting, stream/river damming,
diversion, and channeling, runoff irrigation, aquifer penetration and large small scale storage. The
nature of these techniques, and their development in the context of hunter-gatherer and small scale,
as well as large scale agricultural societies, is reviewed.

, \33) Strategies and Survival 45
(27) RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE NORTHERN MAYA LOWLANDS.

Archaeological projects in the past five years have been carried out by the National Institute of
Acthropology and History, by U.S. universities, and by joint teams. Research efforts range from
mapping and settlement pattern studies to full-scale excavations. Coastal and interior zones are well
represented, and the eastern portion of the peninsula is an increasingly important focus of work.
Results of these projects are rapidly altering the traditional perception of ancient Maya culture and
e@apcation in the northern Lowlands.

(28!) BEYOND TROPHY HEADS, LOOTED TOMBS AND ANCIENT ASTRONAUTS: NEW

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND ASTRONOMICAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE NASCA CULTURE

OF PERU,

Recently a variety of independent projects, working in the different valleys of this area and from
setemct perspectives have begun to address the social, religious, economic and political organization
of Nasca. This symposium brings together investigators in the hope of achieving an initial approxi-
mation of Nasca society. Research results from the major Nasca ceremonial center, habitation and
administrative sites are presented. New stylistic evidence is considered. Evidence for hierarchical
etree) integration and long-distance contacts is discussed.

(29) THE CARROT, NOT THE STICK: STRATEGIES FOR PROTECTING ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RESOURCES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.

Although federal and many states’ statutes afford some protection for sites on public lands or
eithin public projects, the vast majority of site destruction occurs by private actionson private
property. Beating private landowners with a stick is obviously an inappropriate and highly unsuc-
cessful technique to compel owners to protect their sites. Instead, offering a carrot as an incentive is
= more effective approach. This symposium describes and evaluates various public and private pro-
grams and strategies currently being used to protect sites on private property in different regions of
the United States.

(30) ISLAND ARCHAEOLOGY AND MARITIME ADAPTATION IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

Excavation on San Clemente Island has developed an 8000-year cultural sequence. Absence of
lend resources necessitates dependence on maritime resources, and the long cultural sequence allows
delineation of the increasing adaptation to the marine environment. Maritime emphasis is seen in
teunal remains and midden analysis, technology, trade, and religious/ritual elements. Physical anthro-
pological studies reveal some aspects of diet and genetic relationships to mainland populations.
Explanatory statements require the consideration of these multiple lines of evidence as well as
eemparative data from other coastal! and island sequences.

(31) THE CLOVIS-ARCHAIC INTERFACE IN WESTERN NORTH AMERICA.

This symposium addresses the question of relationships between Clovis and immediately follow-
tog cultural complexes in western North America. It “ consider technological comparisons between
Clovis artifacts, and artifacts of other complexes deemed close in time to Clovis; comparisons between
Clovis and these other complexes of subsistence, ranging patterns, and paleogeographic settings, so |
fer as they can be inferred from available evidence; and chronological placement.
(32) RURAL COMMUNITIES AND EARLY STATE ee

Early state formation has been discussed in terms of a variety of regional explanatory models.
These models are frequently based on the excavation of urban sites, archaeological reconnaissance of
varying quality, and texts written from the narrow perspective of an administrative elite. They are
often inappropriate for evaluating the role of rural communities in early state societies) This sym-
posium seeks to evaluate these models. New explanations are offered for the role of rural communities
= early state societies in the Old and New Worlds.

'
(33) STRATEGIES AND SURVIVAL: NATIVE AMERICAN RESPONSES TO EUROPEAN
CONTACT AND COLONIZATION.

This session examines the range and diversity of Native American response to the presence of
Europeans in eastern North America during the 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries. The goal is
twofold. The first is to present a series of case studies which discuss and analyze the pattern of
response for particular native groups. The seven groups to be discussed have been selected to cover
both 2 broad range and the cultural/linguisticdiversity which characterized native people in eastern
North America. The second goal is to move beyond these regional sequences and to look at the

| dynamics of cross-cultural interactions in a more theoretical manner.

, 46 (34) The Cognitive Past
(34) THE COGNITIVE PAST: ONGOING RESEARCH IN HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY.

Contributors to this symposium are exploring the connections between material culture and
cognition in Colonial and Early America. Ideology has always been a subject of interest and a source
of frustration to archaeologists, We have often felt unable to make definitive statements about the
ideological past because of a lack of supporting data. Through the combination of historical and
anthropological data and theory, historical archaeology has the capability of making a more complete
analysis of the recent past than either history or archaeology could do alone.

(35) PRESERVATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORDS.

This symposium focuses on the responsibility of archaeologists to preserve archaeological records,
including field notes, correspondence, unpublished CRM reports, photographs, and other documents.
Papers define the problem and identify possible solutions by discussing the importance and uses of
archaeological records, the first steps toward a records survey, major depositories of archaeological
records, and the grey literature. The objective of this symposium is to begin to form a network of
archaeologists, historians, and archivists to survey and preserve archaeological records.

(36) NEW WORLD DUGOUT CANOES AND CANOEISTS.

During prehistoric and early historic times the use of the dugout camoe was widespread in the
New World. This symposium is to explore the role of the dugout canoe in a variety of socities and
cultures through time and space using ethnological, historical, ethnohistorical and archeological data.
Cultural comparisons of a wide variety of New World dugout canoes and canoeists ts expected to
provide interested researchers with new insights on this aspect of Native American and later Euro-
American life.

(37) MIMBRES MOGOLLON ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOBOTANY.

After a lapse of some 40 years, extensive archaeological research had not been conducted in the
Mimbres area of southwestern New Mexico until the 1970's. Since 1978, Texas ASM University has
been conducting intensive interdisciplinary studies in the middle Mimbres River Valley. Investiga-
tions have been carried out at several Late Pithouse Period and Classic Mimbres sites and a rainfall
irrigation system. This symposium presents some of the interdisciplinary data generated from the
NAN Ranch Project, including the investigations of Mimbres settlement patterns, extramural space
use around a major pueblo, palaeobotanical, mortuary, and faunal studies.

(38) THE CLASSIC MAYA COLLAPSE: THE COPAN CASE,

A major issue in Maya archaeology is the extent, degree and nature of the collapse of Classic
Maya civilization in the southern lowlands between 800-1000 A.D, Copan in western Honduras
participated in this phenomenon. In the symposium the nature of the collapse there is specified and
a variety of data presented from recent projects. This includes studies of past and present patterns of
land use, and the environment, paleodemography studies, and models of social devolution based on

large scale excavations, regional surveys and the inscriptions.
‘ (39) CHANGES IN OSAGE AND MISSOURI CULTURE, A.D. 1675-1825, USING AN

INTERDISCIPLINARY APPROACH.

A three-year National Endowment for the Humanities project to study cultural changes in the
Osage and Missouri tribes during the 150-year period, A.D. 1675-1825 using historical, ethnobiolog-
ical, and archaeological data is discussed. Archaeological materials from six historically identified
Osage (4) and Missouri (2) sites occupied at different periods are the major data base. The cultural
changes include utilization of both wild and domesticated plants and animals, effects upon and from
the regional environment, and adaptation and adoption of customs and manufactures of other native
tribes and those of Euro-Americans.

(41) CURRENT RESEARCH IN UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY.

This symposium is to present current research pertaining to submerged heritage resources.
Included are papers with varied topics such as protective legislation and resource management pro-
grams, the location of prehistoric sites now under water and the relation of this research to land sites,
and the role of historical shipbuilding and its associated cultural baggage the example of the Great
Lakes region. The SAA Meetings will provide a valuable forum for discussion of problem solution in
areas too often thought disparate.

(43) PAST PATTERNS OF HUMAN ADAPTATION IN THE EASTERN OZARKS, SOUTHEAST
MISSOURL

The National Park Service has sponsored a multi-year study of the archaeological resources in
the Current River valley of southeast Missouri. The research program has focused on the interdisci-
plinary study of past patterns of human adaptation in the narrow valleys of the eastern Ozark region,
, (52) Form and Design in Archaeology 47
. and has produced a wide variety of archaeological, biochemical, geological and palynological data.

The integration of these data is producing interpretations of past human adaptive patterns along with

models of landscape evolution and environmental change.

47) EVOLUTION OF AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS ON BLACK MESA, NORTHEASTERN

ARIZONA.

American archaeology is experiencing a reawakening of interest in the appearance of cultigens
and im the adoption of agriculrurally based lifeways north of Mexico, Southwestern archaeology is
wery much a part of this development. Recent workon Black Mesa can contribute substantially to the
ebecidation of the development and consequences of food production in the Southwest. Excavation
of 37 Basketrmaker II and 118 ceramic components provides an unequalled data base on the initial
aexicultural occupation of a particular locality on the Colorado Plateau. These data are used to

ebaracterize the local agricultural adaptation and to evaluate explanatory models of sociocultural
change and evolution.
48) RECONSTRUCTING MAYA DIET AND SUBSISTENCE; CURRENT RESEARCH
. APPROACHES.
This symposium will draw together research relevant to the reconstruction of early Maya diet
and subsistence. Papers represent a variety of research orientations and methods, encompassing
aschaeobotanical and zooarchaeological investigations, trace element and stable isotope studies of
skeletal remains, the archaeological study of agricultural technology, and the uses of information
derived from hieroglyphic writing, iconographic analysis, and ethnohistoric documents. Discussion
will be directed towards a synthesis of present knowledge.
49) NEW PERSPECTIVES ON CAHOKIA: VIEWS FROM THE PERIPHERIES.

The period A.D. 800-1050 in the American Bottom witnessed the foundation for the largest and
most complex socio-economic system ever to have existed in native North America. During the
sabsequent Stirling phase (A.D. 1050-1150), evidence of Cahokia-inspired cultural interaction inten-
sified from Mississippi to Upper Michigan, from Wisconsin to Missouri. To shed new light on
Cahokia’s socio-economic system during these periods, the major archaeological sites bearing evi-
é@ence of Cahokian interaction shall be analyzed as individual culture contact situations and the
results compared in search of processua! patterns that can elucidate the structure underlying the most

| extensive episode of cultural interaction in the Eastern U.S, since the Hopewellian demise.
58) CULTURAL DYNAMICS IN THE LATE PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC PERIODS ON THE

CAROLINA PIEDMONT.

Investigations have been completed on an interdisciplinary project to study diversity and change
empong late prehistoric and historic Indian cultures. Integrated studies of separate data categories have
greduced some preliminary interpretations. Prior to European contact, distinct and stable cultural
patterns characterized the area. After contact, settlements became less numerous, less permanent,
aod more ethnically diverse; strong relationships developed between local and more northerly groups;
aboriginal technologies and subsistence changed in @egree rather than kind; and the deerskin trade
became the dominant mechanism for securing power and for reorganizing social relationships.
$1) PROTECTING OUR ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE: HOW EFFECTIVE IS THE

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCE PROTECTION ACT?

During the past 15 years, federal prosecutors have Become aware of the significance of archaeo-
logical resources and the number of individuals prosecuted for looting such remains has increased.
This symposium analyzes the effectiveness of ARPA’s criminal/civil enforcement provisions. The
Gest section provides an overview of ARPA and the inherent difficulties in commencing an ARPA
prosecution. The second section presents some solutions that federal prosecutors have utilized to
@vercome those problems. The final section examines the pivotal role that archaeologists perform as
expert witnesses and the forensic difficulties they encounter in preparing for trial.

52) FORM AND DESIGN IN ARCHAEOLOGY: A GRAMMATICAL APPROACH.

Emphasis on typology and immutable styles in archaeology is of limited utility in the study of
behavioral and cultural dynamics. In this symposium, the form, design and shape of artifacts is
epproached from a consideration of design elements and grammatical (compositional or organiza-

Sema!) rules. This approach provides a means for unveiling the unity and continuity underlying
seemingly different designs and is useful in exploring cultural continuities or discontinuities, popu-
“stion movements and the dynamics of innovation. The linkage between design and meaning also

| provides a forum exploring the role of constraints, sequential decisions, cultural referents, aesthetics
and hermeneutics.
, 48 (55) Establishing a Radiocarbon Data Base
(55) ESTABLISHING A RADIOCARBON DATA BASE.

Radiocarbon daters and users are currently developing individual systems to suit their needs. The
purpose of this symposium is to bring together several approaches to establishing, maintaining, and
using a global radiocarbon data base. Such a project will provide instant and accurate access of
information on an international level, upgrade standards of reporting radiocarbon dates according to
the most recent advances in the field, and disseminate data in the form of cumulative indexes.

(57) ALTERNATIVE APPLICATIONS OF LITHIC ANALYSIS.

Several innovative techniques and approaches have been developed during the past few years,
but in most instances there has never been an overall assessment of their usefulness in prehistoric
research. Other questions have arisen: e.g., in which situations are the techniques most informative,
and how can they best be applied to large data sets? In this seminar the papers will investigate the
unique contributions of lithic analysis and will show how lithic data can be applied in large projects
to resolve questions concerning classification, culture history and human behavior.

(58) INFORMATION ASA CULTURAL RESOURCE.

The objectives of this session are as follows: (1) todemonstrate that careful planning is necessary
in the management of information in the Historic Environment, if we are to exploit its potential for
public service; (2) to bring together practical experience of these problems from the USA, the UK and
Canada; (3) to show the importance of information technology to this system. The session is titled to
show the common ground between Information Management and Cultural Resource Management.
All papers have special reference to practical examples.

(59) THE MIDDEN MOUNDS: A LARGE SCALE INVESTIGATION OF THE ARCHAIC STAGE

IN THE MID-SOUTH.

The Midden Mound Project, an interdisciplinary research endeavor sponsored by the U.S, Army
Corps of Engineers as part of the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway Project, documents the occupation
of the Upper Tombigbee River Valley, Mississippi from Early Archaic to Mississippi times. This
symposium deals primarily with the well-preserved, deeply stratified Archaic component of six sites
in the valley floodplain. Our aim has been to explain as well as describe changes in life ways during
this period.

(63) RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ENVIRONMENTAL ANALYSES IN EUROPE AND

AMERICA.

This symposium brings together a number of younger workers in different aspects of environ-
mental analysis, from Europe and America. The intention 15 to facilitate trans-Atlantic exchange of
ideas and analytical approaches in a mutual learning process, Papers have been paired for comparison
of methodologies and discussion of solutions to common problems of environmental analysis. The

~discussants have been chosen for their breadth and detachment of viewpoint, as southern hemisphere
specialists.
: (64) PHYTOLITHS IN ARCHAEOLOGY.

Phytolith taxonomy and nomenclature has developed to a point at which specialists may readily
communicate with one another. In spite of advances in the techniques and communicability of
phytolith analysis, the utility of phytoliths in archaeology remain unfamiliar to most archaeologists.
Papers presented at this symposium are selected to present a variety of problems amenable to the
technique. This is indeed to be a state of the art presentation of the phytolith method.

(65) THE CURRENT STATE OF MICROARTIFACT RESEARCH,

Microartifacts, recognizable artifacts less than 2 mm in size, appeared on the archaeological scene
in 1982, Since then there has been consistently increasing interest in using microartifact techniques.
Recent work has expanded the notion of microartifact beyond Fladmark’s (1982) original lithic debris.
This symposium presents several case studies from a variety of site environments, using a wide range
of materials to answer very different archaeological questions. It also contains papers addressing
theoretical and technical aspects of microartifact analysis: studies based on the new generation of
microartifact work.

(66) ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN POLITICS: A WORKING SYMPOSIUM.

The symposium explores how archaeologists represent their interests on the federal, state, and
local levels. This exploration will have two components. The first part of the symposium will consist
of papers by archaeologists and the staff of the SAA Office of the Washington Repesentative. Papers
will also be presented by a representative of the American Mining Congress and the Office of Surface
Mining to provide an outsider’s perspective. In the second part, a panel comprised of the presenters
, 76) Hunter-Gatherer and Horticulturist 49
eed members of the SAA Executive Committee and Governmental Affairs Committee will address
g@uestions and topics presented by the audience.

\68) PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS OF MORTUARY ARCHAEOLOGY.

The study of burials for social and cultural information has benefited greatly by the theoretical
seermulation of the early 1970's, particularly from Binford and Saxe. As a consequence of the founda-
Sens laid by those early formulations, much insight into specific burial records has been made possible.
bp the course of this research, problems have arisen that require elaboration of previously undeveloped
peumts, or inspire rethinking of some aspects of the original formulations. This symposium focuses
em problem-oriented re-examination of burial analysis as it is currently practiced, rather than pattern
emalvsis of specific data sets.

7) SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF CERAMICS: ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES.

Numerous ethnoarchaeological studies describe ceramic technology, economic and social orga-
Gezetion of ceramic production, and pottery use and discard; few deal systematically with ceramic
@seribution|s). This symposium focuses on spatial distribution of ceramics, using data drawn at
several scales. Distribution patterns relate to ethnic, religious, economic, and other distinctions made
serhin and between populations of various types and sizes. Some behavior relating to ceramic distri-
Setion is more complex than previously envisaged. We argue that ethnoarchaeological observations
een be used to enhance our understanding of the past.

72) POLITICAL SYSTEMS AND POLITICAL IDEOLOGIES IN MESOAMERICA:
CONCEPTIONS OF RULERSHIP.
Archaeologists have traditionally addressed the material bases for cultural evolution and adap-
; sation. An important complementary perspective on these same issues concerns the abstract concep-
mioms shared by members of prehistoric communities. Sufficient data have emerged in iconographic
eed ethnohistoric analysis to deal with these conceptions; here, specifically focusing on the nature
of rulership as integral to the political systems as they functioned and evolved. Change through time
um these conceptions is examined from the Formative through the Postclassic periods.
73) MARITIME FOUNDATIONS: PRECERAMIC SUBSISTENCE AND SOCIETY ON THE
ANDEAN COAST.

in his 1975 book, The Maritime Foundations of Andean Civilization, Michael Moseley proposed
that the earliest complex society on the Andean coast was supported by a predominantly maritime
subsistence economy during the Late Preceramic Period (ca. 2500 to 1800 B.C.). Over the past decade,
several researchers have offered theoretical rebuttals to Moseley’s Maritime Foundations Hypothesis.
is this symposium, contributors assess the Maritime Foundations Hypothesis in the light of new data
aed new theoretical formulations derived from recent advances in coastal Andean archaeology, zooar-
sizeology, archaeobotany, and geoarchaeology.

74) NATURAL DISTURBANCE PROCESSES AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD.

This symposium will present a group of papers which will document specific natura! disturbance
processes and how these may act upon archaeological assemblages occurring in differing contents and
@& Gifering contexts. In addition to this documentation, the recognition of a disturbed site requires
Seth methodological and theoretical evaluations as to what may be learned from the archaeological
second given our present interpretive frameworks.

(75) CAVE ARCHAEOLOGY IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA.

Earlier research in the dark interiors of caves in the mid-South of the United States had demon-
scrated prehistoric mining for gypsum and cathartic minerals. Research during the last decade has
eddec significantly to our knowledge of prehistoric caves. The papers of this symposium demonstrate
that caves were used during various periods for the extraction of an expanded suite of minerals, for
particular forms of mortuary activities, and for ritual sanctuaries. Research on surface sites and
ethoographic analogies offer insights for the prehistoric use of caves and cave minerals.
7® EXAMINING HUNTER-GATHERER AND HORTICULTURIST ORGANIZATION

THROUGH THE ANALYSIS OF BISON REMAINS AND RESOURCES.

The participants present the results from several methodological and theoretical approaches to
tée analysis of bison remains. The methodologies include: taphonomy, utility indices, stable carbon
(seempes, and bison tooth attrition. The theoretical! framework is frequently ecological, and definitely
mmeterialist. Participants will discuss important advances made in bison studies. By studying bison
s=mmaims from archaeological sites, we gain significant insights into the organization of hunter-gath-
estes and horticulturists in an environment quite different from deserts and tropical rainforests
seeabited by better ethnographically documented foragers.

50 (78) Mississippian Culture
(78) THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EMERGENCE OF MISSISSIPPIAN

CULTURE, AS EVINCED FROM THE RANGE SITE ANDTHE AMERICAN BOTTOM OF

SOUTHWESTERN ILLINOIS.

The Range site is one of a number of sites in the American Bottom investigated as part of the
University of Illinois FAI-270 Archaeological Mitigation Project sponsored by the Illinois Department
of Transportation. The sequence of late Woodland through Mississippian communities defined at this
site provides the necessary context for understanding the development of the Mississippian Culture
in this region. Two parts are involved. The first focuses on the various data sets from Range. The
second examines each of the major cultural units at Range in light of the overall] shift from Late
Woodland to Mississippian culture in the American Bottom.
, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS
Aasen, Kate (Palynological Analysts)
BASKET MAKER SUBSISTENCE—THE COPROLITE RECORD.

adder and Guernsey (1919) working in Arizona’s Kayenta District speculated that Basketmaker
Asesazi subsisted primarily on corn supplementing their diet by collecting wild plants and hunting.
Howgh (1930) concurred and suggested that Basketmakers hunted, collected wild foods, and cultivated
mmaite and squash. Recent pollen and macrofossil analyses of nearly 100 coprolites from southern
Ueah and northern Arizona rockshelters augment our understanding of Basketmaker’s diverse diet
and Wluminate the importance of cultigens in diet, and the question of whether Basketmaker subsis-
sence wes really different from that of Puebloan successors. (15)

Aber, E Alan (Royal Commission on the Historical Monuments of England, London)
THE NATIONAL MONUMENTS RECORD FOR ENGLAND: ITS FUNCTIONS AND PURPOSE

From the inventories of the RCHME, the NMR has many photographs of archaeological sites. When
se RCHME accepted the National Archaeological Survey and record holding functions of the Ordi-
nance Survey (the national mapping service}, their photographs were also accessioned. The NMR also
gecepted record cards referring to sites in England, with annotated 1:10,000 scale maps showing their
iseation. These are held on microfilm for public access. The NMR keeps copies of unpublished
g@echscological material on microfilm, now consisting of c. 1000 entries. (58)

Abrams, Elliot Marc (Ohio University)
THE CAUSES OF DEFORESTATION AND ITS ROLE IN THE COLLAPSE OF COPAN,
BONDURAS.

The human needs for trees and resources associated with the forested zones of Copan are quantified
aod evaluated in terms of their relative effect on the process of deforestation. It is suggested that the
clearing of trees for the purpose of extending agricultural land and the felling of trees to meet domestic
feel requirements were the two main causes of deforestation, a process which had deleterious effects
em agricultural productivity and lead to a condition which contributed significantly to the abandon-
ment of Copan. (38)

STRUCTURE AND DYNAMICS OF HOHOKAM IRRIGATION SYSTEMS.

Past interpretations of Hohokam irrigation practices tend to be monolithic in nature, Data from La
Ceedad, in the Phoenix basin, are inconsistent with these interpretations. There is evidence for
periodic abandonment of major canals while villages adjacent to these channels persisted. There are
substantial changes in the hydraulic characteristics of temporally discrete canals. Periodic canal
abendonment is related to flood periodicities and lateral migration of the river channel from which

EARLY TO MID HOLOCENE COASTAL ADAPTATIONS, PRINCE OF WALES ISLAND REGION,
SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA '

As archeological survey conducted on Heceta Island in 1985 resulted in the discovery of three
peebistoric site complexes. The oldest site complex was found in beach gravels of a raised beach that
vested upon a till sheet dating 9410+ 130 BP. A second site on a raised beach 12 m above sea level
with a shell midden that dated 8220+ 125 and 8180+130 BP. Analysis of the midden fauna revealed
eat the economy was almost excusively based upon a marine adaptation with minor use of terrestrial
pesources. Midden remains from a 4000 year old rockshelter indicated that the earlier cultural pattern
of resource use continued to form the classic Northwest Coast Culture complex. (18)

ORIGINS OF KNIFE RIVER WARE POTTERY.

Enmife River Ware is a braced-rim pottery which dominates late post-contact period Mandan and
Hiidetse artifact assemblages in North Dakota. It has been hypothesized that Knife River Ware appeared
es the result of loss of expert potters in 18th century epidemics and subsequent degeneration of
existing S-rim pottery forms. This paper supports an alternate hypothesis that appearance of Knife

River Ware represents the result of diffusion and migration, an idea which is grounded in certain
Hidatsa origin traditions. This explanation has bearing on interpretation of interactions among Man-
dan and Hidatsa groups in the 17th through 19th centuries. (67)

CHRONOLOGY, SITE FORMATION AND CHANGING SITE USE AT MODOC ROCK SHELTER,
SOUTHWEST ILLINOIS.

Over 40 radiocarbon dates provide a chronological framework for the site. Though changes in
sedimentation rates show strong correlations with climatic and vegetation changes associated with
the Hypsithermal Interval, there are no major changes in intensity of occupation for several hundred
years. Changes in feature morphology, feature volume and lithic assemblage diversity show major
shifts in site function by about 7800 RCYBP, after the onset of the Hypsithermal, but long before the
local sedimentation rates were stabilized. (46)
Ahlstrom, Richard V. N. (Amerind Foundation, Dragon)

IF TREE-RING DATES ARE SO ACCURATE, WHY AREN’T OUR CHRONOLOGIES MORE
EXACT?

Dendrochronology allows the dating of past events and the reconstruction of past climate. This
degree of resolution is problematic, because it exceeds that available for dating most events. South-
western Archaeologists have responded to this difficulty by using tree-ring dates: (1) to recomstruct
site histories, (2) to produce date ranges and mean dates for ceramic variables, (3) to measure levels
of human activity, and (4) to study architectural history. These strategies are discussed, and the
importance of integrating spatial and temporal dimensions of variation is emphasized. (56)

0'* CORRELATIONS AND ZHOUKOUDIAN LOCALITY 1.

Using modern methods, Chinese scholars propose new interpretations of Pleistocene climatic
phases and the placement within these of fossil hominid sites. The age and duration ascribed to
Zhoukoudian Locality 1 have significant implications for our understanding of human biocultural
evolution. Floral and faunal analyses do not demonstrate the claimed glacial-interglacial magnitude
of climatic shifts. There are problems with the reliability of dating methods. Thus, studies correlating

Locality 1 to 0" stages 16-6 are not convincing. (62)

WHY AFRICAN HUNTERES GATHER.

The rarity of wild plant foods in the diet of the Dorobo of highland East Africa is considered to
result from access to agricultural products. However, archaeological evidence suggests that plant
foods were not used by highland hunters prior to the advent of agriculture. Conversely, Southern
African hunter-gatherers may rely heavily on plant foods because of interactions with food producers.

MISSISSIPPIAN CORE-PERIPHERY RELATIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF GATEWAY
COMMUNITIES: A FORT ANCIENT EXAMPLE.

The Fort Ancient tradition of southern Ohio was influenced by the expansion of the Mississippian

the Fort Ancient sites from the earlier Late Woodland sites. A dendritic model of settlement and
exchange is used to examine the nature of prehistoric economic interaction berween the Mississippian
core and the Fort Ancient periphery. Gateway communities, the nodal points in dendritic networks,

PREDICTABILITY, PRODUCTIVITY, AND PATCHINESS: PALEOINDIAN RESPONSES TO

CHANGING RESOURCE STRUCTURE ON THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS.

During the early Holocene, regional bison populations became smaller while individual herds of
bison became larger, more widely spaced, more mobile, and more variable in their herding and
migration patterns. Paleoindian hunters thus relied on a resource base which was initially abundant
and evenly distributed and whose movements were constant from year to year, but which became
scarcer, more patchily distributed, and less predictable over time. This paper predicts the effects of

these changes on the organization of human society and tests these predictions with the available
archaeological data. |76)

MIDDLE AND LATE ARCHAIC ADAPTATION IN CENTRAL COASTAL PERU.

The Middle Archaic was actually a time of improving health and increasing population. By about
3500 B.C., the sporadic exploitation of the lomas had changed to a pattern of more persistent occu-
pation. There is evidence of increasing emphasis on maritime resources until about 3000 B.C. The
lomas of Paloma was abandoned around 2500 B.C., a time when nearby riverine settlements were
intensively occupied. Annual seasonal stresses common to foragers are clearly registered in the
physical remains of individuals from Paloma. Porentially more devastating multiple year cycles of
stress, begin to be detected in later Cotton Preceramic Period human remains. Successful response to
the challenge of these stresses probably occurred during the Late Archaic Period without extensive
cultivation of domesticated plants. (73)

THE LATE MESOLITHIC HUNTER-GATHERERS AND THE TRANSITION TO FARMING IN

The evidence from the late mesolithic hunter-gatherer Ertebolle Culture (4500-3100 be} in Southern

sedentism, economic diversity and social differentiation, eventually leading to the complex structure
of the early neolithic farming communities of the Funnelbeaker Culture (3100-2650 be). It is argued
that models primarily stressing the importance of ecological shifts are inadequate in explaining causes
and consequences in this example of continuous and dynamic cultural change. (7)

In our attempts to understand the patterns of similarity within ceramic design systms, traditional

SITE LINEAGE BEHAVIOR AND THE ORGANIZATION OF EARLY STATES: FROM

Hisgd reproductive rates among elite lineages in early states inevitably leads to a surfeit of individuals
qime=ing elite status by descent in relation to the number of available offices or titles. This leads to

@EGULATORY PROCESS: BALANCING THE PUBLIC INTEREST WITH THE REQUIREMENTS
OF THE LAW.

Aschacologists bring important expertise to the regulatory process. However, the profession’s con-
seem for the public interest often is not reflected in the regulatory and agency actions due to a lack of
ederstanding of the ground rules of this process. This paper will present a general introduction to
6 regulatory process. The discussion will build upon this introduction to describe how timing,

B@ECENT INVESTIGATIONS AT RIO BEC, CAMPECHE,

This paper presents new information obtained during the field research of the “Proyecto Arqueo-
Seco Frontera Sur” by the National Institute of Anthropology and History, including the first map
che location of the 13 Rio Bec architectural groups, some of which are first reported here. These
dma permit the formulation of a model to explain the behavior and distribution of the distinct groups
«= Rio Bec. Preliminary studies indicate the existence of a ceramic sphere in the central Yucatan
s=ion that coincides precisely with the Rio Bec and Chenes architectural provinces. A separate
eulltural region in central Yucatan may therefore be defined on the basis of both architectural and
Sezamic styles. (27)

STABLE CARBON ISOTOPE RATIOS AS INDICATORS OF MAIZE AGRICULTURE IN
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI AND NORTHEAST ae

Stable carbon isotope analyses of bone collagen from human skeletal remains suggest that intensive
save agriculture began in this region around A.D. 1000, that the incorporation of maize as a signif-
eect component of the diet was rapid, and that approximately 35 to 72% of the human diet from
&D 1000 to A.D. 1600 consisted of maize. Although maize agriculture is generally considered to
seve Deen common by the start of the Mississippian Culture (approximately A.D. 700), these results
seicate that it did not reach full development until some time after A.D. 1000. (43)

ACCOMMODATING CHANGE: THE ONONDAGA [IROQUOIS 1500-1650.

Among native American people in northeastern North America, the Five Nations Iroquois not only
survived European contact, they were successful in accommodating themselves to this change. Using
the Onondaga as a case study, four reasons for this are examined: (1) an interior location; (2) the
internally resiliant structure of [roquoian culture/society; (3) an Iroquoian tradition of growth through
adoption/assimilation, and (4) a fusion of indigenous ‘political’ concepts with the effects of cross
cultural contact. (33)

Marine shell species common to different portions of the Gulf of California are found in Northwest
Mexico and the Southwest. Certain species are limited in range and their general source areas can be
located along the coast. The distribution of these different species has important implications for
defining trade systems or exchange spheres in the region during prehistory. An examination of shell

DIFFERENCES IN BONE REMODELING IN “RESILIENT: COMPARED TO “STABLE-BASED”
POPULATIONS: AN EXAMPLE OF MIDDLE-RANGE RESARCH.

Contrasting adaptive strategies have been inferred from differences in archaeological site size in
the SW, Small (‘resilient’) and large |‘‘stable-based"’} sites are inferred to represent hunting/gathering
mobile and agricultural, sedentary people, respectively. Research in skeletal biomechanics documents
specific changes in bone geometry to occur in response to changes in functional circumstances. If
people from smaller sites were more mobile compared to people from larger sites, then bone will
adapt appropriately and the former will have greater bone rigidity relative to the latter. Cross-sectional
geometric and material properties of femora were examined. ‘Resilient’ femora have relatively greater
rigidity than “stable-based."’ (12)

. RETHINKING SOME PROBLEMS IN MORTUARY ARCHAEOLOGY.

Criticism of the social model of burial analysis formulated by Saxe and Binford have raised serious
questions as to the general applicability of their model in the face of examples to the contrary. The
position that the disposal of the dead is treated in accordance with the more significant of their
statuses stands in direct opposition to instances of relatively simple burial of the elite or of relatively
lavish burials of both elite and non-elite alike. A model, based on an “economy of behavior,” is offered
to encorporate the discordant examples with the Saxe-Bipford model, (68)

THE RELATIONSHIP OF THE STEMMED POINT AND FLUTED POINT TRADITIONS IN
WESTERN NORTH AMERICA.

Excavations in Smith Creek Cave, eastern Nevada, produced evidence for an early Mt. Moriah
occupation. Willow leaf-shaped points, broken and reused as burins and scrapers, were considered to
belong to the Great Basin Stemmed Point Tradition, which later spread onto the Great Plains where
styles like Hell Gap replaced fluted points. Charcoal from Mt. Moriah hearths yielded 8 dates between
10,000-11,000 B.P. Scattered charcoal and wood in the same horizon are dated 11,680 B.P. and 12,150
B.P. This evidence suggests that the Fluted Point Tradition was not the only projectile point tradition
in western North America by 11,000 B.P. (31)

35,000 YEARS OF CAVE SEDIMENTS IN SOUTHERN GERMANY.

The sediments from four cave sites in southern Germany were analyzed for a climatological
interpretation. The time span of the sediments range from the late Middle Palaeolithic up to the Early
Neolithic, It can be shown that the sediments in each cave reacted differently, but it is possible to
exclude these local influences and come to a synthetic stratigraphy which parallels the well-known
stratigraphies of France. Thus we can demonstrate that sediments react faster to climatic factors than
pollen or micro-fauna and that a sedimentological stratigraphy will yield greater climatic detail. (63)

both utilitarian and ornamental/personal items were used as burial accompaniments at the Fredricks
site, there was still a tendency for selection of the latter over the former. (50)

Previous studies have proposed that the individual and combined capacity of ceramic vessels,

implications for many archaeologists attempting to estimate prehistoric household size. However,
much of the variation in vessel capacity is due to occupation, social status, and wealth. Each of these
factors is considered together with the spatial context of vessels in examining the combined capacity
of different vessel types from a sample of households representing several castes and village locales.

Recent compendia of W. European Mesolithic/Neolithic burial data allow an assessment of burial
contexts/characteristics over the Mesolithic/Neolithic boundary. Since it is usually possible to iden-
tify primarily interrments and to detect disturbance, it should be possible to focus directly on mortuary
practices with a minimum of distortion due to post-depositional processes. The major problem in
these relatively early time periods is that the temporal/spatial grid is sparse and irregular. Expectations
about the existence of rank will be developed and matched against W. European mortuary data,
concentrating on skeletal samples from the [berian Peninsula. (7)

CULTURAL, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND CHRONOLOGICAL PARAMETERS OF THE NAZCA
GEOGLYPHS OF PERU.

Studies on the Nazca pampas indicate that the Nazca ground drawings should be distinguished into
linear and figural representations. Based upon associated cultural remains, the linear geoglyps may
pertain to the Late Intermediate Period, while the figural geoglyphs may belong to the Early Inter-
mediate Period. The artistic and iconographic traditions of each of these time periods are examined.

A REGIONAL ANASAZI AGRICULTURAL SUBSISTENCE PATTERN REFLECTED IN THE
POLLEN RECORD.

The record of Pre-Conquest development of agriculture in the San Juan Basin is short (c. 2500 yrs.)
in comparison to the rest of the American continent. Between A.D. 900-A.D. 1200 (Anasazi Period),
site densities increase, even in localities considered to have been marginal for agriculture. An entrenched
but flexible agricultural subsistence base augmented by the seasonal collection of wild foods is
indicated. The pollen record for early to late period sites and from areas of both good and poor water
availability is redundant and predictable. Pollen analysis from the majority of the features reflects
food preparation and processing activities clearly related to agricultural activity. The analysis of
coprolites reflects a heavy reliance on cultivars. |14)

PETER VILLAGE AND ADENA RITUAL CES.

The results of testing of Peter Village, a beth Adeas earthwork enclosure in Kentucky, are presented
as an introduction to the general problem of the interpretation of the use and function of Adena
enclosures. A case is made that use must be carefully separated from function, following Linton. One
is easy to approach with archaeological data, the other difficult. Peter-type enclosures are contrasted
with Mt. Horeb-type. Constant uses and functidhs are posited for the first, shifting uses and functions
for the latter, It is argued that Peter was used as a manufacturing center of barite/galena artifacts.
Possible functions of barite/galena artifact manufacture are explored. (21)

AGRARIAN CONTRACTION OF COASTAL SPRING-FED IRRIGATION SYSTEMS AT ILO,
PERU.

Utilizing EDM located ground controls and photogrametric analysis, prehispanic, colonial and
contemporary field areas of spring-fed irrigation systems are mapped. Two contraction patterns are
evident: (1) retraction of canal systems to their water source; and (2) replacement of up-stream canals
by down-stream systems. Patterning is argued to place constraints on the potential causes—techno-
logical, climatological, and geological—of ongoing agrarian contraction. (1 1)

PEDO-ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT A NORTHWEST FLORIDA MISSION SITE.

Archaeological and soil investigations are being conducted at the San Luis Archaeological and
Historic Site in Tallahassee, Florida. While archaeologists are investigating anthropological and his-
torical aspects of the site, soil investigations are being conducted to understand soil development as
affected by human activity at the seventeenth century settlement. Depths, distributions of soil
chemical properties and particle size and soil morphology indicate human intervention in soil for-
mation. Investigations at San Luis offer a rare opportunity in Florida to study soil genesis where

IN SEARCH OF ORIGINS RESEARCH IN ARCHAEOLOGY.

The search for origins is explicitly or implicitly inherent to most modern archaeology. This paper
examines the fixation of archaeologists on origins in terms of the popular appeal of such research, the
payoffs it accords researchers and the political programs it serves. We show that the emphasis on
origins derives from the fundamental underlying assumptions that structure western thought. The

paper discusses examples of origins research to show how the focus on origins research diverts us
from asking questions which challenge the basic taken for granted assumptions we make about the
world and social reality. (8)

AN INDUSTRY VIEWPOINT.

The industry’s experience has shown that there is a need for cooperation along archaeologists,
federal and state agencies, industries and citizen groups in the field of cultural resource management.
The issues the coal industry has focused on in an attempt to achieve a degree of reasonableness in
the cultural resource management program are: need for and definition of regional data bases, elimi-
nation of federal and state agency overlap, defining parameters for compliance (in terms of survey and
mitigation requirements), building flexibility into the program, defining “eligibility’’ and ‘‘signifi-
cance” criteria, and striking a balance between cultural resource management and potential for energy

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL HIERARCHY IN THE SULA VALLEY, HONDURAS.

An analysis from archaeological survey has been carried out to assess the impact of the Maya on
the Sula Valley, especially whether actual migration of Maya took place or whether the region was
affected by diffusion alone. At breaks in the chronological sequence settlement size and composition,
as well as settlement pattern and artifact data, are examined to see if interruptions in the sequence
could be attributed to foreign intrusion. Alternatively, abrupt changes in settlement and artifact
configurations may have resulted from intrusions by other groups, economic decline or from environ-
mental change including natural disasters. (61)

AN AGRICULTURAL SITE IN THE MIMBRES RIVER VALLEY.

In 1984 and 1985, investigations were conducted at an agricultural site on a tributary of the Mimbres
River. These investigations focused on mapping, testing of water control features, and dating the site.
The site consists of a floodplain complex of irrigation ditches and at least one reservoir. These appear
to have tapped runoff from adjacent slopes. The main ditch is located at the base of a steep rocky
slope. The runoff from larger but more distant slopes was caught in a reservoir on a minor drainage
and diverted to the irrigation ditch by means of a cut excavated through a natural ridge. (37)

CA-Cal-S342, AN EARLY HOLOCENE SITE ON THE WEST SLOPES OF THE SIERRA NEVADA,
CALIFORNIA.

Investigations on Clarks Flat on the North Fork of the Stanislaus River have revealed the earliest
site on the west slopes of the Sierra Nevada. Occupation of the site commences in the earliest Holocene
(circa 9000 B.P.) and extends to the mid-Holocene (circa 6000 B.P.). The earliest component is the
Weestern Pluvial Lake Tradition, followed by a variant of the Pinto Gypsum Phase. The location of
such an early Holocene site will necessitate a revision of the concepts related to Sierran and Great
Basin archaeology. (60)

relations of dominance and influence. Periods of stability and instability are explained in relation
both to physical and sociohistorical structures. (16)

Recent research provides an empirical foundation for assessing the effects of environmental vari-

when floodplain aggradation and high water tables occur with average precipitation, above average
temperatures, and high climatic persistence. Such conditions prevailed during the initial (Basketmaker
II) farming occupation of the mesa, optimal floodplain conditions obtained during the period of rapid

population growth and expansion between A.D. 900 and 1100. These relationships elucidate the

THE OZARKS: KEY TO INTERPRETING LATE-QUATERNARY ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES

| IN SOUTHEASTERN NORTH AMERICA,

During the full-glacial interval, north of 33* N latitude, boreal forest prevailed within a cool,
equable climate. Passage of the Polar Frontal Zone northward during the late-glacial interval resulted
in northward migrations and population expansions of deciduous trees. Zonal atmospheric flow in
the mid-Holocene promoted extension of the Prairie Peninsula. In the late Holocene, oak savanna
was replaced by shortleaf pine-oak-hickory forest as summer precipitation increased. Higher ground-
water levels resulted in expansion of Ozark ponds and corresponded with late Archaic settlement of
upland environments, (43)

From 1847 to 1901, Maya-speaking dissidents of Yucatan maintained political independence, defending
their own territory in eastern Yucatan and paying allegiance only to their own leaders and to elements
af 2 millennial religious cult that featured one or more oracular, miraculous crosses. Documentary
research permits the description of levels of rebel settlements, ranked by scale, permanence of

. architecture, and presence of administrative and religious buildings. Inferences expectable from these
settlement data are compared with those drawn from historically documented events and relation-
ships, to show that conclusions from archaeological data alone would overestimate the degree of rebel
political centralization. (12)

A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF SHELL MIDDEN STRUCTURE.

Shell middens offer both unique preservation conditions and complex microstratigraphy that can
provide insight into site seasonality, resource selection, procurement and utilization, organization of
subsistence strategies, and the effect of human predation on coastal ecosystems. Traditional shell
midden excavation methodologies, fail to accurately describe shell midden structure, consequently
affecting the integrity of resulting interpretations. Proposed here is a methodology for shell midden
excavation which relies on broad horizontal excavation units, and the isolation of discrete depositional
episodes. (18) :

| THEORETICAL ISSUES IN THE INTERPRETATION OF MICROARTIFACTS.

| Study of microartifacts (artifacts less than 2mm in maximum dimension) is relatively new. Although
division between micro- and macroartifacts is arbitrary, there are important differences not only in
techniques of recovery and study, but also in interpretive potential. The latter differences arise because

| microartifacts have different transport and physical properties and typically have different origins as
particles. Although the tendency of initial studies is to treat microartifacts as tiny versions of the
artifacts studied traditionally, they are best conceived as independent data that compliment traditional
sources. (65)

A RECONSIDERATION OF APACHEAN CERAMIC CLASSIFICATION.

Ceramic collections, purported to be authored by Apacliean potters and distributed from Nebraska
co Arizona, have been compared by scholars from the Plains and Southwest for taxonomic purposes.
This comparative review has led to a revision of Brugge’s 1982 Gray Ware classification. The revised
scheme reflects regional variability. Four wares have been provisionally defined. Each ware has been
categorized following the Colton and Hargrave (1937) system of taxonomy: ware, series, type, and
variety. The conferees anticipate and encourage the testing of this provisional scheme. (4)

ARCHAIC FLORAL EXPLOITATION OF THE NORTHERN MARGIN OF THE CAROLINIAN
BIOTIC PROVINCE.

Floral analyses of recently excavated sites in the Saginaw Valley of Michigan have provided infor-
mation regarding the subsistence practices of Archaic populations. fees sites are located on the
sorthern margin of the Carolinian Biotic Province and therefore afford an opportunity to consider
changing adaptations to a diverse and patchy environment. This floral exploitation strategy will be
compared to the adaptations of other Archaic populations within the Midwest and New York. (71)

SPATIAL AND SEASONAL PATTERN IN HUMAN DEATH: EVIDENCE FROM EARLY
GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA.

This paper examines data from a spatial and temporal perspective in an attempt to define patterning
in death behavior. Tombstone epitaph information recorded by field survey, published cemetery data,
and newspaper obituaries serve as the primary data base tor this study. Geographically distinct areas
within Georgia and South Carolina for the period 1775 to 1850 were selected for study. Distinctive
patterning was observed. Through the aid of contemporary accounts of the causes of death, early
medical texts, and modern archaeological /historical data, the causes of these phenomena are hypoth-
esized. (22)

The NAN-20 site is an irrigation system excavated in June, 1985. Owing to the paucity of artifactual
evidence associated with the system, NAN-20s cultural ongin is unknown. Tentative interpretations
by archaeologists and others place it in early Mimbres, Classic Mimbres, Animas, and historic
contexts. This paper attempts to identify possible cultural origins for NAN-20 by drawing on historical
and archaeological data to eliminate those hypotheses whose historical and archaeological require-
ments are inconsistent with the documented cultural sequence of the region. (37)

PRE-ARCHAIC ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY IN GRASS VALLEY, CENTRAL NEVADA.

Surveys conducted during the Gund Ranch Archaeological Project revealed several pre-Archaic
surface scatters on gravel bars and spits deposited by high stands of Pleistocene Lake Gilbert. The
largest of these is situated on a large gravel spit which extended out into marshes fed by the braided
drainage of Callahan Creek. This “site” is a series of isolate and discrete scatters of basalt artifacts,
including stemmed and fluted points and crescents. Assemblage variability appears to be due to
activity sets emphasizing subsistence/maintenance versus manufacturing/retooling. (31)

ONTARIO’S MARITIME BEGINNINGS.

Although the Province of Ontario was first explored and settled on its waterways, shipwreck
archaeology within Ontario's Great Lakes is a very new field. Relatively little fieldwork has been
dome to date, however, a pattern is beginning to emerge of an indigenous Great Lakes shipbuilding
tradition which has evolved in situ. Methods of building, cargoes carried, shipboard artifact assem-
blages and ultimately the manner in which these wrecks have occurred are closely tied to the economic
amd social matrix of which they were a part and the environmental conditions within which they
operated. (41)

THE TOLTEC ARRIVAL IN THE VALLEY OF OAXACA,

Toltec materials are scarce in the Valley of Oaxaca. Nonetheless, it is thought that Tula must have
influenced the developments in the Valley in some way. Frequently the Mixtecs have been regarded
as the agents of culture change in Oaxaca. A look at ethnohistoric documents, settlement patterns
and material culture, however, suggests a rather complicated system of interactions during Monte
Alban IV, and the need to look for other sources of change. One of these will be explored in this paper.

THE INSCRIPTIONS OF COPAN AND THE DISSOLUTION OF CENTRALIZED RULE.

Eighth century Copan monuments reveal aspects of political organizations and evolutions. Follow-
ing the capture of the King of Copan by a Quirigua ruler in 737 A.D., major shifts are seen in the
monuments and their underlying political strategy. As economic conditions worsened, the royal line
was obliged to grant sculptured monuments to heads of competing lineages to ensure continued
tribute. King Yax Pac last monuments emphasized his role as warrior and some have proposed that
he fled to Quirigua around A.D. 800. Inscnptions which date the collapse of the Copan state are

ARCHITECTURAL EVIDENCE FOR THE “MARITIME FOUNDATIONS.”

Architectural patterns show three early village-ceremonial complexes (Peruvian coastal complex
(PCC), Peruvian highland [PHC], Ecuadorian-Colombian [ECC]) in northwestern South America.
While interchange took place between them, they had differing economic bases: the ECC and PHC
emphasized agriculture and the PCC fishing/coastal collecting. The PCC had the greatest amount of
social stratification, followed by the PHC and ECC. Subsequent developments on the Peruvian coast
show increased interaction growing out of the earlier maritime base. (73)

NATIVE AMERICANS AND ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE CAROLINAS. |

Archaeologists often consider minority groups’ use of history and archaeology to be irrelevant to a
“legitimate” understanding of the past. There are almost 70,000 Indians in the Carolinas including
the Lumbees, Edistos, Pee Dees, Catawbas and Cherokees. These Native Americans have an ideology
which is different from that of most archaeologists. Museums and publications created by these ethnic
groups reveal that they use historical and archaeological information in different ways from the
majority of archaeologists. In light of these differences, the application of critical methodology should
improve the conduct of archaeology and the dissemination of results. (8)

DISTRIBUTION OF EXCHANGE GOODS,

A model distinguishing between symbolic and utilitarian values of exchange goods is developed

ariation, generate consistent exchange returns, and are used and discarded in narrowly defined
contexts. Utilitarian value varics as items move across space. This is associated with varied physical
appearances, exchange returns, and contexts of use and disposal. When materials cross boundaries
eheis worth may be redefined; patterns of use and discard also change. (5)

THE EFFECTS OF THE EUROPEAN PRESENCE ON THE PRE-1650 ONTARIO IROQUOIANS.

While inter-tribal relations were largely responsible for different responses to European culture,
native technological heterogeneity and epidemics must also be considered. Since these groups were
dispersed between 1647 and 1651, the duration of their exposure was particularly short; however,
with the advent of the fur trade and associated ventures after 1580, interaction was intensive. In
conjunction with the diversity of their inter-regional connections, the Ontario Iroquoians are partic-

ularly valuable for revealing the nature of native responses to European commodities and culture
from initial contact. (33)

FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS INTO ONEOTA RIDGED FIELD AGRICULTURE IN
SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN.

Qneora agricultural practices are analyzed in light of data recovered during excavations conducted
et the Sand Lake Site (47Lc44) in La Crosse County. This site contains a series of ridged agricultural
Selds buried by an alluvial fan, affording an unprecedented view of Oneota agricultural practices circa
4D. 1400-1450. The authors address aspects of form, extent, and function of the agricultural fields,
eod discuss associated remains. A preliminary evaluation of the ramifications of information on
eericultural systems for other aspects of Oneota culture is presented, (4)

ARCHAEOLOGY IN CITY SQUARE, CHARLESTOWN, MA.

From 1629 to 1775, Charlestown’s City Square contained several public and private buildings. The
ehdest was the Three Cranes Tavern built in 1629. It was used as a meetinghouse until its sale to
senkeeper Robert Long in 1635. The Long property was subdivided, and new houses built in 1712 and
1733. All were burned during the Battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. Archaeological excavation
Secated structural footings and features associated with the Long family’s Tavern, the former Great
Howse. Their spatial distribution provides information concerning early urban land use. (22)

WARIATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF HOUSEHOLD UNITS AT COBA, QUINTANA ROO,
MEXICO.

A detailed survey of surface features (walls, platforms, foundations) at Coba has led to the secure
identification of a large sample of household units, most of which date to the Late Classic period.
Beyond the basic identification and delimitation of the units, our analysis of the sample has allowed
@= to prepare a typology which reflects the substantial diversity in the composition of the individual
emits, and to derive an overall view of their distribution at the community level. (27)

MAYA GREEN STONES AND LAPIDARY TECHNIQUES.

Different techniques and green minerals from a Maya lapidary Workshop at the site of Guaytan-
Castillo (Middle Motagua Valley, Guatemala) were analyzed. No monomineralic pieces were found,
hey were albitites, chalcedonites and jadeitites. Ureyite, a chrome pyroxene, is the component that
eves the emerald green color to some jadeitites. Chrome-muscovite (fuchsite) gives the color to the
saxe emerald green chalcedonites. Scanning Electron Microscopy studies of the patina and of drillings

STYLISTIC VARIATION IN THE POTTERY OF NEOLITHIC TRB-CULTURE IN DENMARK.
Time variation is studied in the structure of the over-all scheme of pottery decoration and decoration

of individual pot shapes. Time variation is related to spatial stylistic variation at 4 local and regional
level. A close relationship is found between stylistic variation and the importance of pottery in ritual
contexts. Stylistic studies of pottery can illuminate ritual practices, among others ceremonies at
megalithic tombs. Variation of ritual practices and pottery styles is related to social change in Danish

STYLE AND SOCIAL EVOLUTION IN POSTGLACIAL NORTHERN EUROPE.

The analysis of stylistic distributions on a regional scale reveals a decrease in the size of style zones
and an increased resolution of boundaries during the Mesolithic period. Clear differences in the scale
and character of stylistic and material distributions occur between the earlier and later Mesolithic.
These developments suggest an increasing concern with expressions of social solidarity and intergroup
differentiation and may be correlated with changes in demographic and social arrangements, (7)

For over 30 years, the Poverty Point site in northeast Louisiana has fueled controversy—great town

building a new empirical foundation. Labeling has been put aside while multidisciplinary forces
rethink the meaning of a 3500 year old settlement that covered 7.0 km’, that built massive earthworks,
that received tons of exotic materials, and that supported itself apparently without agriculture. (6)

l examine the paper’ response to scientific creationism—that is, the changing themes of journal,

surprisingly, the academic community became increasingly interested as the legal threat formalized.
This paper documents those responses via a content-analysis of the journal and magazine articles and
books that appeared before, during, and following the legal challenges in Arkansas and Louisiana. It
asks: (1) Has the academic community been sensitive to real changes in the perceptions of school
teachers, book publishers, and politicians? (How have non-academics responded to the pressures of
the equal-time” advocates, and how have academic responses tracked these effects?) (2) What issues

Archaeologists and biological anthropologists often re-analyze previously collected data sets and
use the results in the formulation of theory. Unfortunately, these re-analyses rarely examine the
biases or assumptions of the original work. Using the Aztalan site in southeastem Wisconsin as an
example, we identify some problems of re-analysis. Aztalan, a Middle Mississippian site, has been
interpreted to represent a society which practiced cannibalism, cremation, as well as secondary,
burial. This study looks at original analyses and assumptions; it also uses the Aztalan case as an
example of some of the problems in the analysis of secondary burial. (68)

mass production by craft-specialists, long-distance transport facilities and a sector of local vendo!
(in towns) or itinerant peddlers. This may shed light on the dynamics of pottery distribution durin
early urbanization. (70)

Archaeological and ethnohistoric data from the Central Andes can shed light on the geographic
configurations of late prehispanic ethnic groups. The findings of systematic archaeological survey a
documentary studies indicate that the Chinchacocha, a group often associated with camelid herdi

SOME INFERENCES OF CULTURE CHANGE AT KAMINALJUYU.
Preliminary analysis of ceramics from excavations at Kaminaljuyu provides information regarding
Sacees associated with the transition from Preclassic to Early Classic, as well as Early Classic to
Get Classic occupation. After the Late Preclassic disintegration of the Miraflores Sphere when ties
ee Kaminaljuyu were predominately with the South Coast of Guatemala and western E] Salvador,
Sere occurred at the beginning of the Early Classic an abrupt reorientation toward the areas to the
serch. It was apparently from this direction that Teotihuacan influence arrived. The nature of rela-
Geeehips with Kaminaljuyu is examined and some inferences are summarized. (1)

LOUISIANA’S PUBLIC PRESERVATION STRATEGIES.
Preservation of sites on private land occurs only if landowners are aware that: |1) they have sites;
@ sttes provide important information; (3) professional archaeological techniques obtain maximum
efeemation from sites; and (4) lack of preservation results in permanent information loss. To publicize
ese facts, Louisiana developed an outreach program that includes booklets, newsletters, press
etleases, exhibits, curriculum materials, and workshops. Additionally, the state: (1) encourages archae-
@ieeists to include public participation in grant projects; (2) works with local planning organizations;
e813) advises landowners about easements and tax donations. The development and effectiveness
of these strategies are explained and evaluated. (29)

CLOVIS ORIGIN UPDATE.
Several recent archaeological and geological developments are relevant to the origin of the Clovis
Colure. New data from Alaska, Canada, Montana, South America, and the Old World are reviewed
= relation to current hypotheses of Clovis origin. In Alaska Paleo-indian-like artifact assemblages,
without microblades but including unfluted bifacial projectile points, occur in geologic context with
sediocarbon dates earlier than Clovis. It is now possible that the Goshen Complex is penecontem-
porancous with and developmentally related to Clovis. If Goshen is earlier than Clovis then a strong
qzse is made for the development of fluting in America south of the glacial margin. |31)

RURAL - URBAN EXCHANGE IN ANIMAL PRODUCTS IN EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN
COMPLEX SOCIETIES.

Most of the evidence for the production and exchange of animal products in the ancient Near

record of the eastern Mediterranean—the reurbanization of Canaan in Middle Bronze fi and the
expansion and absorption of Philistia in the Iron Age—to explore the visibility of rural-urban inter-
action in archaeological deposits and the relationship of smaller communities to large scale political

TANDEM ACCELERATOR MASS SPECTROMETER METHOD.

Application of the Tandem Accelerator Mass Spectrometer in the radio-carbon dating has several
primary advantages: (1) samples contianing very small amounts of carbon may be dated; (2| archaeo-
logical artifacts may be dated without destruction; (3) tests of the method reveal that to a level of
0.6%, no contributions of instrument fluctuations to random errors have been observed. Further,
systematic errors are less than 0.7% (Donahue and Damon 1984). Finally, the capability of the TAMS
method to date very small samples will result in modifications in our field collection techniques.
Materials previously discarded as being insignificant will now become a focus of the archaeological
search and microstratigraphic studies will be needed to ensure that the small samples collected have
the provenience assigned to them. (62)

POST-PLEISTOCENE ADAPTATOINS AND THE EVOLUTION OF AGRICULTURE.

A theoretical model involving population growth, subsistence intensification and marginal cost
economics is used as the basis for predicting and explaining a series of twelve systemically interrelated
adaptive trends that occurred in the Archaic/Mesolithic stage of the New and Old Worlds. These
include the shift from megafauna to smaller game, followed by increases in the following: (1) diversity
in plant and animal foods; (2) variety of tools and facilities; (3) complexity and costliness of tools and
facilities; (4) competition and warfare; (5) range restricting; (6) sedentism; (7) storage; (8) adaptation
to local environments; (9) exchange; (10) status differentiation; (11) the evolution of agriculture. (4)

‘ THE PAST, MASKING AND REVEALING THE PRESENT.

It is possible to demonstrate the way in which the past 1s used to legitimate dominant sectional
interests, either overtly or in the arena of the undiscussed. Yet to what extent are people, particularly
in subordinate groups, duped by ideologies of the past? A recent survey of public opinion about the
past in Britain shows that many people use the past to express their critical evaluation of the present.
Despite the efforts of archaeologists, the past does not have an agreed public meaning. Attitudes to
the past reveal as much about the present as they mask. (8)

DEVELOPMENT OF LOCAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN

PENSACOLA, FLORIDA.

Following a construction project which was particularly destructive to the colonial deposits in the

City, resident professonal archaeologists, historians and concerned citizens organized a grass roots

action group to develop a plan to do something about this loss of archaeological deposits. The approach

taken was a non-confrontational yet persistent pressure approach. Modifications for local government
organization are necessary, but hopefully, this plan can then be used as a model for other cities and

WHAT IS A “WASTER?” COMMENTS ON CERAMIC WORKSHOP IDENTIFICATION AT
TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO.

Identification of ceramic production sites on the basis of surface-collected materials relies heavily
on recognition of wasters,” defective products assumed to have been discarded at the workshop. In
complex ceramic sequences such as Teotihuacan’s, a priori definition of ‘‘wasters”’ 1s inappropriate.
Wares had different technical and aesthetic requirements. In a non-egalitarian society, poorer people
acquired ‘‘second.”’ Variations in overall economy and potters’ skill led to further unevenness in
quality. Many imperfect products were not rejected. Studies of whole and used ceramics define ranges
of acceptable imperfection, and allow formulation of specific criteria for “wasters.” (2)

When two contemporaneously occupied sites or areas within the same site have physical access tc

In complex societie most excavated sites are large urban centers, but most ethnoarchaeological work
has been done in villages which are both more manageable and more traditional, but may not be
comparable. Suggestions for overcoming these problems are offered. (32)

EARLY PROTOHISTORIC MISSISSIPPIAN DUGOUT CANOEISTS IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY.

The four surviving accounts of the De Soto expedition contain important ethnohistoric information
on the large scale use of dugout canoes by societies during the period A.D, 154]-]543_ Statistical and
descriptive data in these accounts indicate that the dugout canoe was not an isolated insignificant
artifact. Based upon this ethnohistoric information, archaeological interpretation of sites occupied in

. the Lower Mississippi Valley before and during the time of initial European contact should incorporate
a Canoeist perspective along with a more limited pedestrian perception. (36)

PHYLOLITH ANALYSIS IN THE ANDEAN HIGHLANDS: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS.

At higher inhabited elevations in the Andes, grasses of the festucoid subfamily predominate. In
these zones extensive human cultural remains with grassland is unique, Here, grasswsare the principal
noncultivated economic plant group and the principal component of the vegetation. The abundant
phytoliths deposited by grasses offers the promise of large samples for archaeological analysis. The
problem of separating culturally derived phytoliths from the background deposition is the stibject of
this study. (64)

PROJECTILE POINT USE INFERRED FROM MICROWEAR OF KIMMSWICK CLOVIS POINTS.

Examination at low (less than 80X) and intermediate (100-400X) magnification under normal and
polarized light reveals diagnostic projectile point microwear on both Clovis points and an experimental
replicate used on dead Zimbabwe elephants. Microwear includes straie and abrasive polishes and is
associated with projectile impact and haft preparation and/or binding. These analyses complement
the contextual relationshps of the Clovis points found beneath and adjacent to American mastodon
(Mammut americanum) bones. It appears the Clovis points were lost after becoming imbedded in the
mastodon carcasses. (77)

REPRODUCTION AND PRODUCTION DURING ARAWAK EXPANSION IN THE BAHAMAS,
: Patterns of human dispersal on islands often conform to the r-selection life-history strategy iden-
: tified in population biology. The economic analysis of this reproductive strategy can be accompanied
: by recognizing that it reflects the allocation of scarce means (time, energy) to the competing biological
: processes of growth, maintenance, and reproduction. From this perspective offspring are viewed as
: the ultimate product of a production system, and the prehistoric expansion of Arawak population in
; the Bahamas is examined as the optimization of productive returns. (5)

CRITICAL THEORY AND THE STUDY OF PREHISTORIC FORAGES.

This paper offers an epistemological critique of currently dominant models in hunger-gatherer
studies, illustrating the source of these current ideas, their tendency to create the present in the past
and to support the ideology of the status quo. The paper then turns to re-examine some key debates
in foraging studies from the perspective of Marxist or Critical Theory to illustrate how the same data
can appear quite different when viewed through a different set of lenses. The discussion goes beyond
the several excellent critiques of the tyranny of the ethnographic record in that it exposes the embedded

| assumptions that are typically unstated and unchallenged. (8)

This paper examines a series of problems using a large collection of faunal material from excavations
in the Lower Garden District. The zooarchaeological data come from sites associated with Irish and
German immigrants who occupied the area in the middle to late nineteenth century. Problem topics
include: (1) the effect of economic status dm patterns of meat consumption, (2) the extent to which
ethnicity is reflected in zooarchaeological data, (3) a model of southern food supply developed by
historical geographer Sam Hilliard, and (4) an hypothesis concerning differences between urban and
rural diets. (71)

MORTUARY MODELS OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION: FITTING THE FACTS.

Mortuary studies commonly make use of the Saxe-Binford approach to mortuary site interpretation.
An evaluation of the demographic plausibility of models of social structure derived from mortuary
variation is presented, based on a study of 1000 years of burial history in the lower Illinois River
Valley. Within this single evolutionary line the Saxe-Binford approach varies in the degree of its
plausibility. Other factors determine the degree to which mortuary practices are representative of
social organization. (68)

EAST SHORT PINES QUARRY: PROCUREMENT AND PROCESSING OF TONGUE RIVER
SILICIFIED SEDIMENT.

Archaeological work at the East Short Pines Quarry in Harding County, South Dakota, is the first
intensive effort to study quarrying operations for Tongue River Silicified Sediment. Investigations at
the quarry and associated workshop area at the ESP site, coupled with subsequent replication exper-
iments, demonstrate how this material was initially obtained and then processed (including heat
treatment) into desirable blanks. Evidence suggests that the Late Prehistoric Period users of the quarry
focused their effort on manufacturing large bifacial blanks at the site which were then taken elsewhere
for processing into finished tools. (77)

TRANSFORMATIONS OF THE MEANDER MOTIF ON GREEK GEOMETRIC POTTERY.

A formal analysis of the development of the meander motif on Greek Geometric pottery is presented.
The different forms of the meander used in the varius stages, schools, and workshops of the Geometric
are described in terms of shape grammars, Relationships between different meander forms are described
in terms of transformations. These descriptions are used to classify Geometric pottery chronologically
and regionally. They explicate the underlying design of the meander from its earliest known form to
the diversity of more complex forms which ak from it and, perhaps most interestingly, they
describe new, theoretical, and possibly undiscovered forms of meander. (52)

The process of sedentism is a gradual trend to the constraint of mobility. This trend is modeled as
the interaction of economic decision making in foraging strategies, population dynamics, environ-

of the northeastern U.S. are compared. Different expectations of mobility adaptations are posited for
each region. Comparison of these regions archaeologically is found consistent with these expectations.

Life expectancy, generation length, and occupation span of sites argue for the use of temporal scales
that are consistent with the biological scale at which populations change. Mortuary remains are used
to estimate population on Black Mesa from A.D. 800-1150. A method using treé-ring dates, ceramic
frequencies, grave goods, and settlement characteristics reveals fine population changes. The fluctua-
tions distinguished by this approach are obscured by many previous estimates using settlement data,

METHODS FOR USING CRITICAL THEORY IN sore ye

There are three techniques used currently to producé a critical analysis of archaeological texts.
Such texts include museum exhibits, historic villages and houses, and archaeological sites open to
the public. In order to discover the impositoin of the present on data from the past, empathy with the
storyteller or interpreter can be used to identify contrasts between past and present. Second, physical
asymmetries in reconstructions and restorations will provide indices to contrasts between present
and past realities. Third, the conflicts in the surrounding ethnographic envirnment may be resolved
in a museum exhibit by rooting them in another time. (8)

MESOLITHIC SUBSISTENCE, SETTLEMENT AND SOCIETY: A MEDITERRANEAN
PERSPECTIVE.
Much social evolutionary theorizing postulates a primeval egalitarianism from which ranked and
stratified societies arise. This under-estimates the precarious basis of the equilibrium imposed upon
inherent competition and latent fission. Seen from the latter perspective, it is rather through an
inability to cope with abundance than through crises of scarcity that egalitarian social norms are |
likely to falter. The Mediterranean is peculiarly suitable to the testing of such theory on account of
the extreme regional diversity of its Holocene environmental dynamics. Attention will be focused in
particular on preadaptations variously expediting and retarding the transition to food production. (7)

SETTLEMENT PATTERN AT CHICHEN ITZA, YUCATAN, MEXICO.
Terrace-platforms, structures, dry-laid-stone field walls, causeways, and inter-architectural spaces
are the major components of the settlement pattern at Chichen Itza. Four hierarchically ranked
categories of platforms and seyen functionally distinct structure types are recognized. Test excavations
indicate that all the platforms studied are contemporaneous within the time of the “Sotuta’’ ceramic
complex. Thus, the variability present points to significant social and political complexity. Addressing
a different issue, the analysis of structure typology and platform hierarchy clearly indicates the unity
of so-called “Old” and “New” Chichen Itza as one cohesive and internally organized proto-urban
community. (27)

CONSUMING IDEOLOGY: PRINTING AND PRINTERS IN THE EIGHTEENTH-CENTURY
CHESAPEAKE.

As information brokers in a largely non-industrial society, colonial printers both infuenced and
reflected community values. With the American Revolution came a number of changes that caused
printers to reorganize their patterns of investment in their craft and to modify the form and content
of the material they produced. Through the analysis of excavated printers’ type from a shop in
Annapolis, Maryland, and through the examination of probate inventories and other historical records,
this paper concentrates on one family’s changing investment into printing in response to economic

among original collections are affected by surface condRions and different propensities of workers to

original collections are available for measurement and comparison with intensive collections. Results
have implications for reliability of common surface collecting procedures. |2}

groups occupied the upper Current River valley between A.D. 700 and A.D. 900. These sites document

that populations in the eastern Ozark highlands participated in the complex aboriginal societies of

the last three hundred years of prehistory in the Central Mississippi Valley. The Emergent Mississip-

pian stage in the eastern Ozark region is characterized by settlement and subsistence patterns which

were little changed from those of the preceding two thousand years. (43)

TOWARD A SURVEY OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORDS.

Archaeological records are an important source of information for archaeologists and, in addition,
have great value in writing the history of archaeology. But these records are not fully utilized because
of lack of knowledge of their importance, location, and content. This paper describes the first steps
toward a planned survey of archaeological records in the United States by focusing on records generated
by New Deal agencies (WPA, NPS. TVA]. The long-range goal of the survey is a published guide or
computer database allowing easy access to archaeological records. (35)

ANCIENT MAYA SALT PRODUCTION AT COASTAL SITES IN BELIZE.

Research reveals that the extraction of salt from lagoon soils was an important activity at ten sites
on the shores of Placencia and Indian Hill lagoons. A diagnostic artifact associated with this activity,
ceramic cylinders averaging 3 cm. in diameter, have been reported from other Belizean coastal sites,
but not heretofore recognized as connected with salt production on this coast. Occurrences of these
salt cylinders” at other sites in Belize, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Mexico are reviewed. (61)

LITHIC MATERIALS FROM THE ORGAN MOUNTAIN PROJECT.
A major problem of use-wear studies has been determining the exact kinds of materials stone tools
| were used upon. The Organ Mt, project of AFAR has a unique chance to test this problem. Using
stone tools with blood and plant residue on them from layers of dry caves, two complimentary studies
were undertaken. John Shea did use-wear studies with replications by the Odell method which
indicated the seven categories of material used from very soft to very hard. Elinor Downes did chemical
. studies of the residues on these same tools and indicates ways the general categories of the use-wear
| studies can be augmented to give more exact determinations of the materials the tools were used
upon. (57)

. PLANTS AND ANIMALS IN THE MAYA HIEROGLYPHIC SCRIPT.

Signs used in the Maya script depict species of flora and fauna. In some cases the signs are logographs
which indicate the name of the plant or animal depicted. In the political inscriptions of the Classic
Period, these glyphs are used as phonetic signs or as proper names and titles. In glyphic texts and
accompanying scenes on pottery, murals, and in Postclassic codices, a wider range of subject matter
offers valuable information about which plants and animals were most important to the ancient

Maya, and how they were utilized. Conventions of Maya writing and iconography will be discussed
in relation to the problems of species identification. (48)

HUNTING HOPPERS: EATING THINGS THAT GO JUMP IN THE NIGHT.

Deposits at Lakeside Cave spanning the last 5000 years contain evidence of grasshopper |Melanoplus
sanguinipes) use. During the summer, salted and sun-dried hoppers are washed up on beaches and
form windrows up to 15 cm x 1m x 10-15 km. Hoppers produce over 3000 calories/kg, and return

. rates averaged 1,560,000 cals/hr. Digestible proportions cannot be determined, but assuming only
10% is usable, an average return rate of 156,000 cals/hr is still evident. Optimality models suggest
hopper collection should be favored over all other resources, but rankings may need to be modified
by volume and transportation problems. (60)

HOLDING: A HOPEWELL COMMUNITY IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM.

The FAI-270 project has recently completed excavations on the first single component Hopewellian
village found in the American Bottom of Illinois. Complete excavation of the Holding site has provided
a unique insight into the community plan of a smal] Middle Woodland village. The ceramic assemblage
indicates connections with both the Illinois River valley, and the lower Mississippi valley. Artifacts
of copper and obsidian, as well as pieces of mica, galena and fluorite were recovered. These, in addition

to.a simple ceramic figurine, indicate that the site was involved in the Hopewell interaction networks.

PROCESSES OF AGRICULTURAL EXPANSION AND CONTRACTION IN THE COLCA AND
OTORA DRAINAGES, PERU.

Preliminary research in both areas has identified patterns of terrace construction and abandonment.
Evidence from the Colca valley suggests that terrace construction began as early as 500-600 A.D, with
a significant expansion during Inca times. Abandonment came only during the Early Colonial Period.
Terrace construction in Otora began around 1000 A.D., and subsequent occupations are located farther
upvalley, indicating continual agricultural abandonment toward the water sources for irrigation.
Social and environmental factors responsible for the differences between these two areas will be
discussed. |11}

AN EXAMINATION OF THE TRANSITION FROM FEUDALISM TO CAPITALISM THROUGH
A LOCATIONAL ANALYSIS OF SETTLEMENTS IN CATALUNYA, SPAIN,

Changes in land use patterns are examined during the transition from feudalism to capitalism, a
period of major economic reorganization. Abundant historical records documenting this transition
are preserved in Catalunya. Rank, size and nearest neighbor techniques are used to examine the
changes in settlement which structured both the concentration and distribution of surplus. My
analysis demonstrates that settlement processes are not exclusively of local origin, but rather are
regional in form. (16)

ABOVE THE AMERICAN BOTTOM: THE LATE WOODLAND-EARLY MISSISSIPPIAN
TRANSITION IN NORTHEASTERN ILLINOIS.

Dated deposits from the Cooke Site have yielded new information regarding the sequence in which
Mississippian elements were incorporated by groups in the Prairie Peninsula. The site presents a
picture of a Woodland group embracing Mississippian maize technology but only limited elements
of the ceramic tradition from the south. Evidence from this and other sites in the Chicago Region
suggests a continuity in settlement patterns despite the change in subsistence. The incorporation of
maize agricultural technology in the area seems to represent no more than an intensification of a
pattern of exploitation of a starchy seed complex. Faunal assemblages show that broad spectrum
exploitation persisted. (19)

THE USE OF CONJOINS IN TYPOLOGICAL STUDIES.

One of the side benefits of extensive reconstruction of artifacts from the Middle to Upper Paleolithic
transitional site of Boker Tachtit, Negev, Israel, is the view provided of the history of specific tool
use. This is particularly clear for a series of burins which pass through a number of different phases
of use through various types of resharpening. Each resharpening results in a traditionally different

. burin “type.” Thus, the significance of-these types as either functionally or stylistically significant is
called into question. (57}

SPECIALIZED SHELL ORNAMENT PRODUCTION IN THE HOHOKAM COLONIAL PERIOD.

Production of shell ornaments has long been presumed, but until lately never proved in the study
of the prehistoric, landlocked Hohokam culture. Recent excavations at two sites on the periphery of
the Hohokam region have uncovered a local shellworking industry, where marine shell, mostly from
the Gulf of California, entered the system as unaltered raw material, and exited as a finished good.
Evidence for on-site food production and consumption is, altematively, quite rare, suggesting partic-
ipation in a regional system of trading relations that may have seen barter of shell omaments for food
supplies. (24)

SMALL ISLANDS WITH LARGE POPULATIONS: THE ROLE OF THE ROCK ISLANDS IN
PALAUAN PREHISTORY.

The Palau Archipelago of western Micronesia is dominated by volcanic Babeldaob Island, and by
four smaller volcanic islands and two coralline limestone platform islands. Also present are more
than 200 small coralline limestone reef islands and islets referred to as “rock islands.’’ The rock
islands likely were utilized prehistorically as specialized resource procurement areas: however, between
A.D. 1200-1450 at least 11 sizable villages were established and abandoned in rock island settings.
This phenomenon is examined in order to shed light on Palauan cultural evolution and on the
emergence of social differentiation. (13)

A NEW GENERATION OF PHOTOGRAMMETRIC INSTRUMENTS FOR ARCHAEOLOGY.

Photogrammetry has long been used in archaeology, but only in the last several years have instru-

SOME SPANISH MISSION INFLUENCE ON ABORIGINAL MATERIAL CULTURE: AN
EXAMPLE FROM THE GEORGIA COAST.

Excavations by the American Museum of Natural History were recently completed on an aboriginal
site, 9LI8, adjacent to a late 16th and 17th century Spanish Mission on St, Catherines Island. Early
Spanish accounts were examined prior to excavation for descriptions of aboriginal behavior in the
vicinity of Mission Santa Catalina de Guale and hypotheses were generated. Project objectives included
testing of these hypothesized Spanish influences in domains of architecture, “borrowed” material
culture, and aboriginal subsistence. Illustrative materials suggest greater diversity of recovered remains
in response to the Spanish presence. Fewer than expected examples of ‘‘borrowed”’ tools, ceramics
and metalwork and plant remains emphasize a continued dependence on corn. (22)

The Rench site consists of two burned dwellings and associated features. Nearly 80% of the pottery

are locally produced Canton Ware varieties while 20% are Mississippian forms nearly identical to

store maize, they could hold enough to feed between 33 to 44 persons for a year, an enormous surplus.

It is possible that Mississippian vessels were traded by American Bottom groups for maize grown at

Rench. (49)

ETHNOHISTORIC DOCUMENTS IN THE STUDY OF MAYA DIET AND SUBSISTENCE.

Descriptions of early Maya hunting, fishing and cultivation practices yield useful data for recon-

research. Importance of faunal resources in native diet and economy may have been greater than
traditionally supposed. Faunal analyses, paleonutritional and paleopathological studies of human
skeletal remains, and archaeological evidence for animal management support this view. The potential
of ethnohistoric resources for reassessing prehistoric faunal utilization is considered. (48)

ETHNOBOTANICAL PERSPECTIVES ON THE RURAL-URBAN CONNECTION.

The rural agricultural economy sustained the urban civilizations of the ancient Near East. Plant
remains recovered from urban settlements represent the final deposition of agricultural products and
other resources that originated in the countryside, so some understanding of regional agricultural
economies and environments may be reached through the study of plant remains from such sites. A
more complete understanding can be reached through examination of both rural and urban compo-
nents of complex settlement systems. A discussion of truncated research in the Kur River basin of
southern Iran illustrates these points. (32)

CROSS CULTURAL SIMILARITIES BETWEEN THE CAHOKIA REGION AND THE CENTRAL
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY A.D, 800-1150.

Just before A.D. 800 to A.D. 1150, there were a number of traits held in common in the American
Bottom and in the Central Mississippi Valley. Some of these traits, such as conch shell and Mill
Creek chert hoes, consisted of artifacts and/or raw material derived from Cahokia or nearby. Other
traits, such as maize, the bow and arrow and shell tempered pottery, represent similar response to
external stimuli, and a similar cultural evolutionary history. There is surprisingly little artifactual
evidence of direct contact between the two regions. There is no evidence of a population movement
from Cahokia south. (49)

COASTAL RESEARCH IN THE VICINITY OF ILO, PERU.

Radiocarbon assays on a shell midden verify a Pacific coastal occupation in southern Peru beginning
some 10,000 years ago. Local populations were initially dependent upon marine resources that were
subsequently complemented by the introduction of irrigation agriculture to the Moquegua Valley
north of Ilo, and to areas of adjacent coastal springs. There is a limited Tiwanaku presence in these
agricultural zones. However, coastal farming reached its maximum areal extent during the subsequent |
Chiribaya occupation, after which the amount of land under cultivation has steadily declined. (3)

REMOTE SENSING AND COMPUTER ANALYSIS: ALTERNATIVES IN THE EVALUATION OF

In response to the traditional double standard concerning the excavation of Native American versus

A TEST OF PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS AT BIG HIDATSA, NORTH DAKOTA.

Big Hidatsa is a late prehistoric-early historic Plains Village on the Knife River, Ethnohistorical
studies and accounts indicate an extensive use of com (Zea mays L.). Preliminary phytolith analysis
failed to find significant amounts of corn leave phytoliths (cross-shaped} in the sediments. Further
study reveals that corn cobs produce abundant phytoliths of a different shape. Ethnohistoric reports
indicate leaves husks were left in the field while cobs were threshed in the village. Phytolith analysis
should consider differential use of plant parts and specific sediment provenience. |64)

FUNCTIONAL EFFICIENCY AND TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE; A HAFTING TRADITION
MODEL FOR PALEO-INDIAN NORTH AMERICA.

Three early projectile point traditions widespread in North America, fluted, stemmed, and notched,
are defined largely on the morphological attributes of their haft elements. A model of function in
which technological traditions are adopted sequentially through time, because of their efficiency,
suggests a possible reason for the adoption of these hafting traditions by diverse cultural groups across
most of North America. (31)

STRATEGIES OF PALEOINDIAN HUNTERS.

The Paleoindians were not free wanderers, their activities were patterned around locations where
they were confident of finding food or other necessities of life. It is suggested that the selection of
these base camps, characteristic of patterned nomadism was contingent on three factors: the presence
of wild plant foods and small game which might be relied upon to support the band at a minimum
subsistence level; proximity to trails or refuges frequented by big game; and occasional proximity to
essential sources of raw materials, notably stone. (76)

deposition. For this reason, it is important to evaluate the potential contribution of natural disturbance

processes in reorganizing the archaeological record. In order to accurately interpret material arrange-

Subsistence economics has been the focus of a great deal of recent research in the Maya Lowlands,

and Classic periods, lithic tools produced at the site of Colha were adapted to unique local agricultural
conditions present at several sites in Northern Belize. Specialized agricultural technology and culti-
vation procedures, as well as other subsistence activities, are reflected in use-wear analyses done on
tools from these various sites. (61)

VARIATION IN EMBODIED ENERGY DUE TO CLIMATIC CHANGE: ONONDAGA [ROQUOIS

as represented in the assemblage and site features, should be relatively low during the climatic minima,
and should be increasing during the maxima. Results indicate that this does occur,{12!

THE IMPACT OF FOOD PRODUCTION ON POPULATION AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS

DURING BASKETMAKER TIMES ON NORTHERN BLACK MESA.

The adoption of corm farming permitted more permanent and denser occupations of marginal
uplands like northern Black Mesa. Archaeological surveys of a289 km? area on the mesa have recorded
126 Basketmaker II sites in contrast to only eight hunter-gatherer Archaic campsites. Changing

hydrologic conditions and increased agricultural production at the end of the Basketmaker II period
are thought to account for the abandonment of habitations in drier uplands and the concentration of

PRACTICAL PROBLEMS IN COMMENCING AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROSECUTION.

Since the passage of ARPA, federal prosecutors have been utilizing that statute to protect archae-
ological remains situated on public and Indian lands. However, the criminal penalties imposed by
that law depend upon the “value’’ and the type of resource that was altered or removed, the degree of
damage done to the site, or the location of the site. Although ARPA provides some form of protection
for these remains, not all archaeological resources are accorded absolute protection. This paper
analyzes the effectiveness of ARPA and discusses the problems that must be overcome in order to
obtain a criminal conviction. (51)

procurement strategy developed with a strong emphasis on hunting and the possible keeping of

of tools and debitage deposited on them suggest changes to more permanent types of settlements. (7)

THE DEATH OF THE SOUTHERN PLANTATION: A LEGEND FOR MODERN ARCHAEOLOGY.

One great legend of the American South is that the plantation system was destroyed by the Civil
War. This story holds that after 1865 the four million slaves freed in the South were given 40 acres
and a mule, while plantation owners saw their lands divided and their plantation system dismantled.
Although something much different occurred, this difference eluded even federal census takers for 40
years. This modern legend has a great effect on how archaeologists perceive and analyze the plantation

CUT HUMAN BONES FROM THE EDWARDS I SITE (34BK2).

Edwards I, in southwest Oklahoma, is a fortified village affiliated with the Wheeler phase (A.D.

evidence of dismemberment and defleshing. The dorsal surface of one femur has evenly spaced grooves
and is polished. This bone apparently served as a rasp. Sample characteristics are compared to similar
assemblages from the Northern and Southern Plains. The Wheeler phase represents a Plains Caddoan
occupation. Ethnographically, these people participated in ritual cannibalism. This study indicates
that this was a relatively old pattern among these Southern Plains people. (67)

CERAMIC TRENDS AT THE RANGE SITE AS AN INDICATOR OF CULTURAL CHANGE.

Increasing specialization and complexity commonly attributed to the growth of Mississippian
Culture is supported by the analysis of over 4000 vessels associated with the Late Woodland through
Emergent Mississippian periods at the Range site. Observed trends in vessel morphology and associ-
ated attributes represent more than changing asthetic tradition. The impetus for ceramic change is
best understood relative to the social and economic realms. An interpretation of the dynamics of the
evolutionary process is possible given the continuum of occupation at the site. Diversity in the
ceramic tradition of the two periods is tempered by gradual changes at the phaes level. (78)

PARTICIPATION AND HIERARCHY: THE STRUCTURE OF THE TEOTIHUACAN
COMPOSITE CENSER.

This paper examines art works in archaeological contexts from the point of view of their structuring
principles. The Teotihuacan composite censer will be compared to what we known of the socio-
political organization of the city in Tlaminmilolpa, Xolalpan, and Metepec times (ca. 250-750 A.D.).
It will be suggested that the role of hierarchy and of the centralized state have been overemphasized
and that a system or an ideology of participation on a wider scale was one of the factors in the longevity
and success of the Teotihuacan polity in the Classic period. A comparison with the earlier type of
incense bummer will provide a historical dimension. (2)

Historical archaeologists are beginning to develop an ability to identity ideology in the archaeolog-
ical record. Ideology is also one important element in the histories of the places we explore and is a
part of the context to which our archaeological data and interpretations should be directed. This paper
examines the separations and contradictions in Annapolis history discovered through ethnographic
research and their relationship to ongoing archaeological research and interpretation in the city. (34)

“, ., SCATTER’D UPON THE ENGLISH SEATS:” CULTURE CHANGE AMONG NORTHERN
VIRGINIA ALGONKIANS.

When the English first settled Tidewater Virginia in A.D. 1607, they found themselves immersed
in a sea of Algonkian-speaking Indian groups owing varying degrees of allegiance to the centralized
polity of the Powhatan Chiefdom. Algonkian responses to the English invaders depended, in part, on
their political relations with the Powhatan and their distance from the earliest permanent English
settlements. Consequently, the process of culture change among the Algonkians of northern Tide-
water Virginia, further from both Powhatan and the English, was different from that of their brethren
to the south. Archaeological and historical data are used to trace the acculturation of the Northern

‘ Virginia Algonkians. (33)

KAMINALJUYU AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCULPTURAL ARTS.

The site of Kaminaljuyu has provided archaeologists with a large and diverse corpus of sculptural
art documenting a long history of sculptural development. It is evident that Kaminaljuyu sculptural
art did not develop in isolation but, the relationship of the Kaminaljuyu corpus to other sculptural
traditions has yet to be clearly defined. This paper will address some of the fundamental questions
concerning the nature of the relationship between Kaminaljuyu sculpture and other analogous sculp-
tural collections. Emphasis will be placed on the role of Kaminaljuyu in the development of sculptural
arts during the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods. (1)

PREHISTORIC AGRICULTURAL LAND-USE ON THE PAJARITO PLATEAU: A
CONSIDERATION OF THE FIELD HOUSE STRATEGY.

Perhaps the most ubiquitous of all Puebloan structural sites are the so called “field houses’’ which
dot the landscape throughout the American Southwest. This study employs a spatial microeconomic
model to address the field house strategy and provides a partial test with archaeological data from the
Pajarito Plateau, New Mexico. It is concluded that the field house strategy combines elements of both
shifting and sedentary agriculture as an adaptive response to the joint pressures of increasing popu-
lation density and environmental uncertainty. (56)

HISTORIC PERIOD FRONTIER SETTLEMENT IN THE EASTERN OZARKS OF SOUTHEAST
MISSOURL

Settlement throughout the region, ca. 1800-1860, generally fit the organizational pattern charac-
teristic of the immigrant Upland South culture as defined by geographers, historians, and anthropo)-
ogists. Within the broader pattern, however, local variations in cultural adaptation are evident. The
Ozark National Scenic Riverways Project, through historical research and archaeological inspection
at a variety of early nineteenth century sites, has provided the opportuity to investigate frontier
adaptation on a local level. In the Current River drainage, two organizational systems were operant
influenced by economic and environmental variables. (43)

EMERGENT MISSISSIPPIAN OCCUPATION IN THE SOUTHEASTERN OZARKS OF
MISSOURL

Archaeological investigations in the southeastern Ozarks of Missouri have yielded data on Late
Woodland and Emergent Mississippian occupations. Shell tempered ceramics, small arrowpoints, and
other diagnostic artifacts which occur later in fully developed Mississippian phases can be traced to
as early as A.D. 650 in this region. While these early manifestations cannot be termed as traditionally
defined, they appear to be direct antecedents of Mississippian phases which flourished in southeastern
Missouri and northeastern Arkansas in the 13th and 14th centuries A.D. (43)

THE MESOLITHIC OF WESTERN EUROPE: DYNAMICS IN TIME AND SPACE.

Prior to the spread of agriculture across the continent there is dramatic evidence for technological
innovation, the exploitation of new habitats and species, increasing exchange, sedentism, status
differentiation, and conflict in the context of growing population and location constraint. Examination
of recent evidence from Western Europe provides some indication of these trends and dramatizes the
rapidity of change during this period. Particular emphasis is given to flow and constraint in lithic
assemblages and to changes in subsistence strategies. |7)

A THEMATIC APPROACH TO NASCA MYTHICAL ICONOGRAPHY.

The advantages of using a thematic approach to Nasca mythical iconography of ceramics will be
outlined. This technique views art as a symbolic system similar to a language. By studying consistent
correlations of design details of the art style which reflect the set rules of expression under which the
ancient artisans worked, meaningful interpretationg can be made. Examples of how the author has
effectively used this methodology will be presented. (28)

White-tailed deer from the midwest are shown to vary in size through space and through time.
Quality of food in fall and severity of winter weather are shouEye to be responsible factors. In Missouri,
at the time of Osage occupation, deer in the central portion of the state were larger than conspecifics
in the southwest, An analysis of the age structure of deer from the Osage sites reaffirms Elder's (1965)

THE FUNCTIONAL INTERPRETATION OF PREHISTORIC LOWLAND MAYA NON-MOUND
FEATURES.

Identification of prehistoric non-mound features in the Maya Lowlands raises questions about
population estimates, interpretations of environmental relationships, and social structural reconstruc-
tions based on the configuration of above-ground features. The challenge non-mound data poses to
traditional models hinges on the functional interpretation of a wide variety of non-mound activity
areas. Evidence from the excavation of a ground-surface floor at Nohmul, in northern Belize, will be
presented in terms of its functional implications. (61)

TO FISH IN THE AFTERNOON: BEYOND SUBSISTENCE ECONOMIES IN THE STUDY OF
EARLY ANDEAN CIVILIZATION.

Spatial, temporal, and formal dimensions of the archaeological record must be adequately assessed
in any discussion: the coast cannot be separated from the highlands, chronometric controls for the
Preceramic Period-Initial Period transition must be refined, and variations in characteristics of archi-
tectural complexes and settlement patterns must receive attention. The nature of the social formations

associated with large architecture must be studied. This paper will focus on recent work at E] Paraiso
and its relation to these problems. The subsistence economy, regional and inter-regional role, chro-
nology, and society at the site, as evidenced by room organization and other data, will be discussed.

Patterns of local copper industry organization revealed by research in a small region of Cyprus are
discussed. These patterns and the changes in them occurnng in the period 1000 B.C. - A.D. 1500 are
evaluated with respect to three alternative models of metallurgical production. The models relate
metallurgical production to local village organization, markets and distribution, and the degree of
centralized control. The relation of the observed pattern of development to resource availability and
to wider economic and political patterns is examined. (16)

Surface collections and excavations at several sites in eastern Mississippi have provided data on
occupation span and community size and permanence. The amount of pottery, number of features,
artifact diversity and density, thick black midden, and other indicators tend to support their identi-
fication as sedentary habitation sites. Their small size and the distribution of artifacts on the surface
indicate that they were hamlets supporting two to five houses. These represent the earliest identified

OPAL PHYTOLITHS, PASTE COLOR, AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION: COVARIATION IN

CERAMICS OF THE PALENQUE REGION, MEXICO.

Research on ceramic paste composition and paste color under refiring explores variability in Maya
pottery. Relationship of phytoliths to the color effects of iron is assessed in terms of multivariate
chemical composition. Contrasts in these mineralogical variables are pronounced between the “Macro-
Palenque” and ‘Plains’ chemical compositional groups. Among the implications addressed are the
use of a restricted number of variables in studies of paste composition and the investigation of
production sources and localized exchange. (61)

A GULF COAST AND MAYA ENCLAVE AT TEOTIHUACAN.

Foreign affiliations of the Merchants’ Barrio at Teotihuacan can be demonstrated through the
presence of Gulf Coast and Mayan ceramics and goods such as shell, jade, and chert. Excavations have
revealed the highly distinctive nature of the architecture in this barrio. Eighteen circular structures
with ramps have been excavated. They bear close resemblances to many reported in Panuco and
Central Veracruz. The function of the round structures is habitational, providing strong evidence for
the presence of a foreign Gulf Coast ethnic group residing at the Merchants’ Barnio. (15)

A UNIQUE ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXAMPLE OF ABORIGINAL ISLAND USE DURING THE
HISTORIC PERIOD.

To deal with the cultural pressures exerted on them by the Spanish missionization in Southern
California, the indigenous populations made use of various responses. An extreme response was
apostasy. This can be documented in the archacological record from an aboriginal site on San Clemente
Island (the Ledge Site). Occupied for a short period by a group of mission runaways around A.D. 1800,
the site yields data on maritime subsistence as well as a unique record of religious activities known
ethnographically. (30)

TACTICS OF ANIMAL USE FROM THE EARLY VILLAGE THROUGH THE PARTHIAN PERIOD
IN LOWLAND IRAN, MESOPOTAMIA, AND ENVIRONS, WITH A NOTE ON THE
DEVELOPMENT OF COMPLEX SOCIETIES.

Using data on the ecology, behavior, physiology, reproduction, and production of sheep, goats, and
cattle, expectations for variation in ratios of cattle to sheep and goats, and sheep to goats were
established. The expectations were compared to ratios derived from faunal data for 26 sites in the
area. The results indicate increasing specialization in subsistence behavior in rural settlements. It is
argued that specialization resulted from selection for decreasing the risk of resource failure, and this
type of selective pressure contributed to the development of complex societies. |32)

Analysis of zooarchaeological evidence from coastal sites shows that marine vertebrates and inver-

animals. From this perspective, itis predicted that marine resources would have been used extensively
on the Andean coast during the Late Preceramic Period. Study of marine resources excavated from
Paloma, indicate that use of marine resources was, indeed, extensive. This result is interpreted as
evidence that marine resources supported early populations on the Andean coast. |73)

The evidence for a Maritime economic system is abundant after 5,000 B.P, There is scant evidence
for the development of a maritime subsistence base prior to 5,000 B.P., due to the fact that sea-level
rise submerged earlier sites on the continental coast. On a raised marine floor south of Ilo, Peru, a
shell midden (The Ring Site) has been investigated that has extensive evidence for the use of shellfish,
fish, bird, and sea mammals dating to between 10,575 and 5,725 B.P. The data from this site demon-
strate that a maritime economy was in place much earlier than previously suspected. |73)

THE ECOLOGICAL CONSTRAINTS OF THE MARSHALLESE CHIEFDOM: DOES IT
CONTRADICT OR COMPLEMENT THE POLYNESIAN MODELS?

Archaeological evidence suggests stable settlement in the Marshalls for at least 2000 years. It is
argued here that models for the development of chiefdoms that depend on ecological diversity, control
of large numbers of people and the need to simplify complex decision making processes are deficient
in explaining the rise of chiefdoms. It is argued that the development of chiefdoms is less population
dependent than density dependent, and that the management of scarce resources rather than the
maximization of resource distribution over an environmentally diverse area are important causal
considerations in the rise of chiefdoms in the Pacific as well on continental landmasses. (13)

procurement system. Cehpech ceramics and Puuc-style carved stone were found together with archi-
tectural and sculptural traits more typical of the Late Classic, perhaps deriving from the south or
southeast. The site was also fortified and Ek Balam raises questions about the nature of Puuc expansion

ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR PASTORAL NOMADISM DURING BYZANTINE TIMES

Archaeologial reconnaissance has revealed contrasts in settlement patterns and architecture in the

reflect the differences between the settled urban-agricultural society in the steppe and its pastoral-
nomadic relations in the desert. The ability to detect the remains of pastoral nomads, and to construct
models of their relations with their settled counterparts is of theoretical interest beyond the Byzantine
period in the Negev. (23)

THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF COLONIALISM. |

Archaeological studies of European expansion into continental North America from the 15th
century onward have focused on the creation of colonial enclaves and on the processes through which |
European material culture was replicated under these new circumstances. These interpretations ignore
that the process of colonial expansion was carried out in areas inhabited by native peoples. Such
imterpretations reflect an orientation in which techno-environmental factors dominate the under-
standing of complex social relations in culture contact situations. Examples are drawn from archae-
ological studies of North American colonialism with emphasis on recent approaches to detect material
evidence for native resistance to colonial expansion. (8)

this clearance continued for three centuries after the collapse. Reduced rural populations presumably
hung on, cultivating depleted, often eroded soils with reduced yields. (38)

Recent developments in Maya archaeology have made it clear that the inadequately known Puuc
hills regions played a critical role in the shift of power from the Southern to the Northern Maya
lowlands during Terminal Classic times. Three seasons of field research at Sayil have produced the
first comprehensive map of any Puuc “great city,’ delimiting a community over three square kilo-
meters and displaying 2000 ancient and historic features representing 28 tormal rypes in some 1000
clusters. Significant patterns and determinants of features, feature clusters, spatial organization, and
site limits are discussed. (27)

NEW APPROACHES TO UPPER PALEOLITHIC ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY.

Five thousand stone tools from the Paleolithic site of Solvieux have been subjected to quantitative
attributal analysis as part of the Current attempt to explore alternative approaches co Bordesian
systematics. Analytic procedures involved assume a more flexible and artisanal form than those oiten
extolled in the literature, and one presumably more suited to the needs of the journeyman systematist.
Results throw new light upon the nature of lithic typological patterning and help redefine the terms
in which the issues of Upper Paleolithic industrial variation may be approached. |57)

FISHING AND FARMING: ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE FOR AN ANDEAN TRADITION
OF SPECIALIZATION.

Recent archaeological work in the Chincha Valley on the Peruvian South Coast supports documen-
tary evidence for specialized fishermen in that zone during the Late Horizon, and a review of the
archaeological record for the entire coast reveals evidence for specialized fishers and farmers at least
as far back as the Early Horizon. If the tradition of coastal specialization began with sedentary lifeways
in the Late Preceramic Period, as some evidence suggests, it would help explain the sudden increase
in social complexity observed in the archaeological record at that time. (73)

GEOMORPHIC PROCESSES AND LANDSCAPE EVOLUTION AS RELATED TO HUMAN
SETTLEMENT IN THE CURRENT RIVER VALLEY, MISSOURI.

Intensive occupation of the narrow rock-bluff bordered valley since Paleo-Indian times has been
concentrated on two fluvial terraces. While accurate absolute dating of the terraces has been elusive,
nevertheless they record changing hydrologic regimes attributable to Quaternary climatic changes.
Rather than being caused by cyclic degradation and aggradation, the terraces area product of variations
in the rates and patterns of lateral stream-channel migration, Fluvial responses to historic-period land
use practices have been dramatic. (43)

This paper seeks to rebut the conventional wisdom that pollen analysis is neither necessary or
profitable in Historical Archaeology through examination of pollen studies in the Haute-Savoie
province of France. In this interdisciplinary research, Historical Archaeology is the method of choice
for establishing and justifying inferences about economic system changes in Central European villages.
Palynological studies linked to this effort are pertinent because land use and vegetation change data

From the Protohistoric period (ca. A-D. 1526-1625) through the Contact period (ca. A.D. 1625-1740),
aboriginal populations underwent depopulation and sociopolitical consolidation while European trade
and inter-regional, inter-ethnic aboriginal conflict intensified. On the intrasite level, these trends are
evidenced by a comparative reduction of sedentism and site size and an increase of storage/caching
facilities and diversity of architectural features. On the intersite level, Contact period sites tend to
be located near abandoned late prehistoric sites, at fords along trading paths, and near regional ethnic
boundaries. (50)

THE COOSA CHIEFDOM: RESPONSES TO EUROPEAN CONTACT.

The sixteenth century Coosa chiefdom of the Ridge and Valley Province of the intenor Southeast
provides an example of a society which underwent shortterm, early European contact with Spanish

demonstrated for the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. It is argued that this dramatic change 1s
not “acculturation,” but is a significant form of culrure change which takes place in many nonwestern
groups, True acculturation only takes place following prolonged contact with English traders in the
late seventeenth century. (33)

ZONAL COMPLEMENTARY IN THE MOQUEGUA VALLEY.

This paper reports on archaeological investigations in 4 small! valley of the Moquegua drainage
(Otora) which were designed to test models of “vertical control,” or ‘economic complementarity.”
Moquegua has been suggested to be an area of pre-hispanic colonization by the Lupaga kingdom, a
pre-Inka state located on the southwest side of Lake Titicaca. A model] of Lupaqan colonization is not
supported by the Orora data, although there is strong evidence of pre-Lupaqan, multi-ethnic settlement

by coastal and circum-Titicaca polities. (3)

MICROARTIFACT ANALYSIS: A TOOL FOR UNDERSTANDING SITE FORMATION
PROCESSES.

The technique that can best provide information on human depositional events is grain-size analysis
combined with compositional identification of particles within the sand-sized fractions (microartifact
analysis} and the gravel-sized fractions (macroartifact analysis). Within each size class the composition
(including artifacts) and quantity of particles is calculated. The grain-size distributions of individual
types of particles |¢.g. ceramics, flaked lithics, unmodified rocks and minerals} are examined and used
to infer the depositional history of the archaeological site. |65!

A PRECERAMIC CONTEXT FOR PETROGLYPHS IN NORTHWESTERN ONTARIO.

Archaeological deposits directly overlie petroglyphs at a multi-component site on Clearwater Bay,

‘ Lake-of-the-Woods, Ontario. The site |DkKr-4) exhibits an array of Selkirk, Blackduck, and Laurel
ceramics beneath which there is an Archaic zone with Oxbox affiliations. Much of the rock art is
attributable to the Archaic. A radiocarbon date of 2,580 > 140 has been obtained for the uppermost

Archaic. The lower levels are characterized by unifaces, and unmodified flake tools. Some of the rock

art may date to initial occupations which appear to have occurred about 9,000 years ago. |46)

THE NATURE AND DANGERS OF CULT ARCHAEOLOGY.

Major characteristics of cult archaeology can be grouped into three basic areas: (1) the unscientific
nature of their evidence and methodology; (2) their tendency to provide simple, compact answers to
complex and difficult questions; and (3) their persecuted “underdog,” antiestablishment stance. These
characteristics are discussed and their role in the popularity of cult archaeology is briefly assessed.
The paper ends with a plea for professional scholars to communicate better with laymen, especially
on the subject of objective methodology and research. (9)

THE FIRST HUNDRED YEARS OF ATLANTIC PIEDMONT FOR TRADE.

Seventeenty-century mercantile policies affected the structure of English-Indian trade relations,
settlements, and alliances. Through their adaptations to burgeoning English trade, Indians of the
Atlantic Piedmont appear to have been able to maintain their ethnic and political identities for at
least Aifty years. One of these groups, the Occaneechi, may have initially adapted by modifying a pre-
existing role as regional trade mediators. After 1676, the Occaneechi moved south and played a less
politically powerful role but did provide guides, supplies, and perhaps furs to Virginia traders. The

Piedmont trade provided goods for both English and Indian expressions of stratification and/or ethnic |

PARALLEL RULE SYSTEMS IN DESIGN.

Composition rules us¢ given spatial relations to arrange lines in designs. Descnption rules interpret
designs in the language defined by the grammar. Composition and description are independent
processes that can be interrelated in description schemes. A correspondence can be defined between
composition rules in a grammar and description rules so that designs and their descriptions are
generated in parallel, Each time a composition rule is applied to elaborate a design, the corresponding |
description rule applies to update the description of the design. In this way, the common intuition
that form and meaning are connected in designs is formalized, (52)

RADIOCARBON AND THERMOLUMINESCENCE DATING 1985: DREAM AND REALITY. |

Radiocarbon is the most Hexible and useful technique for dating young geoarchaeological carbon-
aceous materials. Thermoluminescence is now a family of methods reliable for dating most fired clay
materials, and light-bleached nonvolcanic sediments. For all the advances within both C-14 and TL,
the ambiguities of sample provenience and stratigraphy remain virtually unchanged. Paradoxically,
the achievement of higher accuracies is often accompanied by lower precision; the very ingredient
necessary to highest accuracy. The powerful new techniques come fully equipped with new pitfalls.

COMPLEXITY IN ANASAZI MORTUARY BEHAVIOR: EVIDENCE FROM THE DOLORES
ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROGRAM,

Data from the excavations of Basketmaker and Pueblo sites indicate a greater complexity and
considerably broader range of mortuary behavior and ritual than has generally been attributed to or
documented for the Anasazi, Unusual burial patterns at Dolores include cremations, the scarcity ot
inhumations in midden deposits, and the use of pitstructures and protokivas as tombs for double and
multiple inhumations. Isolated skeletal elements in subfloor features and a mass secondary burial
suggest ritual-oriented cannibalism and curation of human remains as part of Anasazi mortuary
behavior. (24)

MESOPOTAMIAN URBAN POPULATION STRUCTURES.

An investigation into the structuring of urban populations in ancient Mesopotamia suggests that
the dichotomy heretofore assumed cannot be maintained. Instead, an urban landscape made up of
numerous calls, or neighborhoods, some of tp exhibit the strong kinship orientation normally
associated with rural tribal groupings, can be proposed. On the basis of these findings, it may be
hypothesized that population exchanges betwen the urban centers and their hinterlands may have
been both a constant process and a significant driving force contributing to the dynamics of Meso-
potamian civilization. (32) :

ecological factors not addressed by Hudson. Agricultural labor demands are shown to exert an impor-
tant influence on settlement; distances to water, well-drained soils, and settlers from other tribes

METHODS FOR LOCATING INUNDATED PREHISTORIC SITES IN THE MARINE

. ENVIRONMENT. :

Prehistoric archaeological sites dating from the late Wisconsin low sea stand can be expected to
occur on the continental shelf. Site locations can be predicted using: (1) published sea level curves
and (2) high-resolution seismic profiles. The potential for site preservation also can be evaluated for
a given area using such factors as the rate of eustatic sea level change, the slope of the shelf, sediment
type, depositional environment, and by making direct inferences from seismic data. (41)

THE DECLINE OF CERAMICS ON ISLANDS: SOME AVENUES OF INQUIRY.

An interesting parallel between prehistoric insular cultures in Oceania and in the West Indies can
be observed in the gradual decline in ceramic manufacture both in terms of quality and decoration.
This paper reviews some of the evidences that have been suggested to resolve this problem, An
attempt is made to present a model that would apply to these insular areas. It is suggested that island
trade networks, over relatively large bodies of water, may have been largely responsible for restricting
ceramics as status items, no longer requiring the efforts of elaboration. {18}

LATE PREHISTORIC AND HISTORIC LITHIC ASSEMBLAGES ON THE NORTH CAROLINA

An analysis of lithic artifacts from three North Carolina Piedmont sites spanning the Late Prehis-
toric to Historic has provided information on assemblage organization, stages of manufacture, raw
materials, and spatial distribution of debitage and tools. Similarities between assemblages include:

use of mostly local raw materials, use of smal! triangular projectile points; a toolkit consisting of
scrapers, drills, gravers, perforators, and choppers; tools made on flakes rather than bifacial preforms;
and very few formalized tools manufactured for long use-life. Although the assemblages are generally

points. (50)

READING PREHISTORIC STONE TOOLS.

This paper emphasizes the first step in studying lithic assemblages. One must start with a tech-
nological reading of the scars of cach piece, reconstructing the chronological order of the knapper’s
actions. This diachronic view represents a dynamic approach using: (1) experimentation (recently
renewed) in order to check the observations and allow questions and answers; (2) refitting pieces (if
possible) in order to know sequences followed and to define technologically the characteristic pieces
coming from each phase of debitage and retouch. This reading has to be completed by crossed data
from estimated strategics of raw material procurement, use wear analysis and living-floors distribution
maps. After classifications, the final goal is the approach of the conceptual schemes comprehension
towards prehistoric behavior. (57)

LESSONS FROM 80 YEARS OF ARCHEOBOTANICAL COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS AT
CHACO CANYON, NEW MEXICO.

Review of the accumulating body of botanical data from Chaco Canyon reveals patterning of plant
remains with respect to site types, and room and feature functional types. Temporal shifts in domes-

abound in the analysis of perishable materials. Chaco results seen in many regional projects are
particularly illuminating on the subject of economic health and coping mechanisms throughout the
San Juan Basin ca. 900-1200 A.D. (14)

DISCUSSANT’S COMMENTS,

Contemporary with Nasca is the Moche Culture of the north coast of Peru. Like Nasca, Moche is
famous for its magnificent art style and monumental architecture. Also, the two cultures, though
separated in space, can be argued to be in contact during the later part of the Early Intermediate Period.
Discussion of the symposium papers from the comparative perspective of the north coast leads to
new and exciting insights about both Nasca and Moche. (28)

MORTUARY BEHAVIOR, LABOR ORGANIZATION AND SOCIAL RANK.

Progress has been made by linking rank and mortuary differentiatio& to labor organization in
neolithic Europe (Renfrew 1984, Hodder 1984}, although study of labor organization in non-ritual
activities indicates that the implied level of differentiation did not exist at this time (Trinkaus in
press}. burial in megalithic tombs also may have become less exclusive when both overt and masked
rank hypotheses would predict more. Better theoretical integration of ritual and non-ritual data
domains is shown to link mortuary differentiation and labor organization to restricted resource access
characteristic of social hierarchy. (68)

A Middle Horizon site appears near the present town of Cabanaconde, taking advantage of the low
slope in that area to cultivate maize. Occupations in the Late Intermediate Period are found on the
surrounding ridgetops, with substantial terracing of the slopes around the sites. The Inca continued
exploiting these areas, but placed their administrative center down near the town again. Social as
well as environmental factors are thus seen as operating in the evolution of land use in this region.

DOMESTIC PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE: A CONTRADICTION?

This paper represents an attempt to examine prehistoric exchange within neolithic society in a
structural sense rather than as an empirical type. It accepts as a premise the argument that any system
of resource distribution should not be studied separately from production. However, within a domestic
mode, production is supposedly geared toward use not exchange value, The paper reviews approaches
to the study of exchange in precapitalist societies. It incorporates data on production and exchange
of stone from the neolithic site of Opovo in Yugoslavia to examine connections between production,
acquisition, distribution, and use within a particular social context. (16)

THE JAMESTOWN SITE (214-14), A LATE WOODLAND COMMUNITY IN INTERIOR
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS.

This site is a large circular Late Woodland community in the Galum Creek drainage in Perry
County, Illinois. Excavation of the central site area revealed over 600 pit features including storage
pits, hearths, structures, and burials grouped in clusters around a central open courtyard, the center
of which was marked by two large posts. Radiocarbon dates indicate the site was occupied from A.D.
250-1000 with the circular village pattern developing by A.D. 600-800. Analysis of a sample of the
botanical data indicates an emphasis on nut crops available in the immediate site area with cultigens
being of less importance. (19)

THE TRANSFORMATION OF A RURAL IDEAL: FARM STRATEGIES AND FAILED PRACTICE.

The pre-commercial hill farms of nineteenth century northern New England are used as the context
to examine traditions in rural life. After the mid nineteenth century, farmers reacted to changes in
the national economy that benefited commercialized agriculture and mono-cropping. They adapted
their pre-commercial strategies in attempts to evolve improved practices from well-tried methods. In

trafisforming their farms, northern New Englanders re-defined their rural values, giving them concrete

expression in the physical world. (34)

PREHISTORIC BACKGROUND OF TULARE LAKE, CALIFORNIA.

Prior to modem agriculture, California’s southem San Joaquin Valley contained three large, shallow
lakes, the largest of which was Tulare Lake. The lake was subject to great fluctuations in size and
level, but seems never to have completely dried up. Artifacts from lakeshore localities range from
Clovis or Clovis-like to historic point styles, suggesting that Tulare Lake’s biologically rich lake-
marsh environment served as a strong and enduring attraction to native peoples from late Pleistocene
times into the historic period. (31)

BONES, CUNEIFORM TEXTS AND FOLK TAXONOMY.

The use of cunciform texts to enhance analyses of animal bones from early Mesopotamia raises a
critical question, “just how ‘etic’ are these texts?’’ The introduction of folk taxonomy focuses not
only the situation presented by the texts themselves and their translation, but the proclivity of
archeozoologists to work solely within the ‘etic grid.’ Faunal analysis and folk taxonomy bear pro-
ductively on the understanding only if we understand the contrasts and similanties well enough to
frame questions tailored to specific contexts. (32)

CULTURE CHANGE ON THE CREEK INDIAN FRONTIER,

The dynamics of Creek-European interaction in the colonial Southeast can be viewed from two
perspectives. The increasing frequency and intensity of social interactions led to Creek demographic
and cultural adaptations to intrusive European and aoe populations, to introduced material goods,
and to Old World epidemic diseases. Economic intéraction took the course of escalating European
exploitation of regional resources leading to the assimilation of the Creek subsistence system into
the European trade network and world market. Archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence for these
transformations are discussed. {33}

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MOTIF SHAPE.

revealed that raffia cloth patterns are specifically named, but that within any named pattern wide
variations in motif shape are perfectly acceptable. Research on orientation, alignment, and symmetry
of the motifs suggests that these features may be as important as overall shape in determining cultural
appropriateness. These findings are related to archaeological classification practices which separate

MIDDLE-LATE WOODLAND CERAMIC DESIGN GRAMMARS OF THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC
REGION, EASTERN UNITED STATES.

Two distinct ceramic design grammars are present in the region during Late Woodland times (ca.
A.D. 1000-A.D. 1600). One set of grammars, which is relatively simple, is found in coastal areas and
is associated with Algonkian-speakers. The second, much more complex, grammar is found on
ceramics from the Piedmont, Ridge and Valley, and Allegheny Plateau areas and is associated with
Iroquoian-speakers. Design grammars of Middle Woodland Abbott Farm ceramics are not similar to
those of local, later Algonkian-speakers and suggest population movements during late prehistoric
times. (52)

FUNDAMENTAL PALEOECOLOGY; THE NEGLECTED FACTOR IN LESSER ANTILLES
ARCHAEOLOGY,

This paper's central thesis is that archaeologists, for the most part, have ignored (or inadequately
considered) fundamental relationships between ecological and cultural processes in the Lesser Antilles.
Yet, human adaptation to the small and resource-limited islands of the Lesser Antilles was affected
by environmental diversity, variation, and constraint. Integration of ecological and cultural studies
is vital for the Lesser Antilles archipelago, even more so than for other island groups located elsewhere

in the Caribbean region. (5)

THE RED RIVER DUGOUT AND CADDO I TRADE AT A.D. 1000-1100,

Radiocarbon dates of A.D. 1005 and 1065, from a cypress dugout canoe found beneath the Red River
bank, coincide with A.D. 1050 and 1090 dates from a tomb at the Caddo I Mounds Plantation site, ca
15 km downstream. This is the midpoint of the Gahagan-Mounds-Crenshaw axis of early Caddoan
ceremonial centers between Natchitoches and the Fulton Bend, whose social stratification incorpo-
rated a rigorous burial complex, sacrificing abundant exotic materials and objects. Dugout travel on
the major rivers must have enhanced the exchange system for nonlocal materials and finished goods,

including contacts with centers like Spiro and Cahokia. (36)

WHAT MEAN THESE BONES? INTERPRETING THE FAUNAL DEBRIS FOUND IN SITES

OCCUPIED BY NEANDERTALS.

Whereas even 10 years ago it was still largely assumed that animal bones found in association with

‘ stone artifacts on Middle Palaeolithic sites reflected human dietary behavior, recent research has
shown that this assumption is open to question. Any individual “layer” from such sites usually
represents a palimpsest of deposition over an unknown period of time to which people, other carnivores
and rodents have contributed. Examples of the problems encountered in analyzing faunal material
will be given from sites in western Europe, Criteria will be proposed for future research to disentangle

the nature of this faunal record. (63)

EXCAVATIONS IN RURAL DOMESTIC COMPLEXES AT COPAN, HONDURAS.

divergence of the burial context pollen for the pollen rain frequences from control samples indicates
evidence of selected ingestion of floral foods. These data may: |1) aid in determination of plant foods

MIDDLE TO LATE ARCHAIC DIETS AND SUBSISTENCE ON THE CENTRAL COAST OF

Data from the Paloma site document use of a variety of mostly wild plant and some terrestrial

marine resources continue to dominate but are more frequent after 3500 B.C. until abandonment
around 2500 B.C. This dietary emphasis is found at Chilca I and other sites on the central coast
through Late Cotton Preceramic times (ca, 2500 to 1800 B.C\). Mostly marine animal and wild

the subsistence basis of carly complex societies need refining. |73)

The Archaeological Resource Protection Act states that unauthorized disturbance or removal of

Those who would enforce the moral obsolute (digging without a permit 1s wrong”) too often fail to
understand that these prescribed mechanisms operate on a sliding scale of values, Thus, the question
is not only “is this person guilty’ but also “if so, how guilty?” Both archaeologists and enforcement
staff need to distinguish the “whether” from the “how much” questions. (51)

THE PRESTIGE GOOD SYSTEM IN THE PREHISPANIC CARIBBEAN.

The prestige good system of the Taino Indians of the Greater Antilles played a critical role in the
integration of elite lineages throughout the islands, and, as a principal channel for the interaction of

MATTERS OF FACT.
The “foundationalism”’ of positivist archaeology has been decisively challenged in recent years; it

is now widely accepted that “facts” cannot be treated as immutable givens. Many post-positivist
researchers seemed compelled, asa result, to embrace a radical relativism whereby the past is whatever
we choose to make it or need it to be. I will examine two arguments leading to this conclusion: the
epistemological argument from theory-ladenness in observation, and the politically informed argu-
ment from the interest-specificity of the discipline considered as a human enterprise. Even though
these arguments do establish the underdetermination of archaeological interpretation by all available
evidence, they do not secure the conclusion that al] potential conceptions of the past must be granted
equal credibility “relative to context,” Many are just wrong and can be decisively eliminated. (8)

PREHISTORIC COASTAL ADAPTATIONS ON THE NORTHERN BEAGLE CHANNEL, TIERRA

DEL FUEGO, ARGENTINA: A COMPARATIVE PERSPECTIVE.

The antiquity of maritime adaptations in this region now spans some 6,000 years, and apparently
began with a focus on sea-mammal hunting that only later encompassed shellfish collection. Critical
factors in the penetration and use of coastal resources in the region include early Holocene forestation
and postglacial sea-level changes. Expanding population densities may be related to intensification of
marine exploitation, but a lack of fish resources prevented the development of characteristics ass0-
ciated with coastal adaptations in subarctic environments. (20)

evidence suggest that the central government was highly dependent on semi-nomadic groups. The

was able to retain political independence at a time when the rest of the Near East was coerced and
incorporated by Assyria. (32)

Most archaeological sediments on outer Cape Cod comprise one of seven types: uncultivated A
horizon, B horizon, intact shell midden, aeolian sand, plowzone, slopewash, or modem artificial fill.
Although this classification mixes units of deposition with units of weathering, it is effective for
differentiating sediment source, sediment age, depositional setting, and integrity of archaeological
context. B horizon and plowzone are the most common units; intact shell midden and uncultivated
A horizon are rare, being limited to areas buried by sedminets of post-Contact age. The study is based

rum consumption. Lead level variance partition is significant for sex, age, Caribbean-endemic path-
ologies, incisor tooth filing, burial orientation, association with coffin, and redware sherds. The latter
factors allow definition of an African-derived mortuary complex; tribal African origin of some speci-
mens is consistent with their low lead accumulation whereas Barbados-born slaves would have been
in continuous contact with lead-contaminated products.

A PROGRESS REPORT ON ASSESSING SITE SIGNIFICANCE AT FORT HOOD
The Fort Hood Archaeological Resource Management Program is involved in establishing a repre-
sentative sample of sites at the Fort Hood Military Installation for long-term protection. This effort
is the cumulative product of earlier attempts using portions of the Fort Hood database. The current
project has access to data from a stratified random sample of 14 percent of the base and data from
total coverage of all surveys of greater than 7] percent of the base. A multivariate approach to defining
site significance is being used and focuses on four general categories: 1) chronology; 2) site function;
3) environmental variables; and 4) physical condition of a site. This progress report presents graphic
illustrations of the kinds of automated data analysis capabilities available at Fort Hood for this study.

ARCHAIC HUNTING PRACTICES DEPICTED IN A NORTHWESTERN PLAINS ROCK ART
‘ STYLE
A collection of about 75 panels of pecked rock art from the southern Black Hills, South Dakota and
Wyoming, includes detailed depictions of Archaic period communal game hunts. The rock art illus-
trates use of artificial enclosures, atlatls, and what appear to be goads. Humans in costumes or disguises
are also included in the scenes. Fauna depicted includes deer and/or elk, pronghom, bison, mountain
sheep, mountain lion, and possibly dogs. The overwhelming preponderance of deer (ca. 64% of the
animals pictured! is inconsistent with current views on Middle and Late Archaic subsistence that
assume a bison-hasedeconomy.

MICROCOMPUTER IMAGE ENHANCEMENT OF SCRATCHES AND STRIATIONS ON
OBSIDIAN TOOLS

An important type of microwear on obsidian tools is the formation of scratches and striations.
Relatively little work has been done to systematically examine the conditions and causes of the
formation of these attributes. In conjunction with a rigorous experimental program of using obsidian
sools in a number of functional contexts, a microcomputer has been used as an image analyzer and
enhancer. The computer is linked to a high-power microscope and images of striations can be stored,
compared, and enhanced using appropriate software. The system has proved very useful in the
comparison of tools before and after the experimental program and in the matching of striations
caused by certain types of experimental use with striations on obsidian tools derived from archaeo-
logical contexts by providing a rapid, objective retrival system. Systems requirements, including
hardware, software, and support, are described in this applications report.

AUTOMATED NATIONAL CATALOG SYSTEM (ANCS)

The National Park Service |NPS}, Curatorial Services Branch, has developed the ANCS using dBASE
Ill Plus database management system for MS/DOS compatible microcomputers to be used at over
300 park units and archeological centers for NPS museum collections. Archeological collections
constitute 65% of the estimated 10 million artifacts in NPS areas. The ANCS will significantly speed
up the cataloging of archeological collections and minimize staff time to manage collections infor-
mation. The program facilitates rapid data entry and retrieval of catalog data, field documentation
and site provenience for systematic field collections. The proposed networking capabilities of the
software will enable the aggregation of archeological data at regional and Washington offices.

COMPUTERS AND CULTURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT AT GRAND CANYON

The advent of micro-computers has allowed data manipulation, storage and graphic capabilities
previously unavailable except to main-frame computer Users. The archaeologists at Grand Canyon
National Park have utilized a number of micro-computer programs on their IBM PC/XT for data base
management, statistical manipulation, graphics and mapping. Through the use of dBASE III, Lotus 1-
2-3, Statpac and Autocad, large amounts of data can be managed and manipulated addressing both
the needs of management and the concerns of researchers. Information is readily available for a
aumber of management concerns and research questions. The significance of the applications lies in
the ability to provide for the needs of both parties, without compromising the needs of either.

MICROCOMPUTER SIMULATION OF RADIOCARBON

Monte Carlo simulation of C-14 dating allows interpretation of sets of dates based on knowledge
of each step in the dating process. The results are preferable to those obtained by statistical manipu-
lation of dates (assumptions for which are violated by Cq4 dates). Reproduction of existing sets of
dates by simulation provides not only beginning and ending dates for the archaeological unit but also
snformation about the distribution of dated events in the interval so defined. Simulation also allows
estimation of the number of dates needed to define adequately a given time interval.

PREHISTORIC EARTHWORKS AT THE RED WING LOCALITY

Mounds, embankments, and effigies represent a major site type at the Red Wing Locality in
southeastern Minnesota. Most of the more than 3,000 mounds in the area have been destroyed by
cultivation and modem construction. Survey records compiled by the Northwest Archaeological
Survey in the 1880's, however, can be used to reconstruct the content, plan, and situation of mound
groups. Microcomputers are used in an integrated approach to the study of these mounds. Applications
packages are used to develop a database, produce scaled reconstructions of mound groups, and evaluate
variability of mound characteristics.
Dohm, Karen (Washington State University)
EFFECT OF POPULATION DENSITY ON HOUSE SIZE: COMPUTER GRAPHICS AS AN
ANALYTIC TECHNIQUE

Theoretical considerations suggest that more activities are conducted within enclosed spaces when
population is aggregated. This implies use of more roofed space per individua) and per family in
aggregated villages than in dispersed ones. Computer analyses of 22 historic Pueblo villages provide
weak support for the theoretical statement.

Area measurements from published maps were made with the aid of a Numonics 1224 digitizer.
Software programs (SAS and SAS/GRAPH on an IBM 3090) produced descriptive statistics and graphics
visually assisting analysis of the statistics. Findings apply both to population comparisons of individ-
ual settlements and to simulations of population dynamics in regional archaeological studies.

A BASIC SYSTEM FOR DATABASE MANAGEMENT USING dBASE II FOR
MICROCOMPUTERS

CASMENU is a relatively simple, expandable database management program written in dBASE I
for microcomputers. Integration of the program and basic lab sorting/ID is mutually intelligible to
archaeologists, technicians, and data entry assistants. Mastery of formats can be gained within | - 2
hours of instruction. Program application is keyed to a user-defined dictionary of encoded accession
numbers and data entry symbols written in logical, non-numeric characters. Major applications to
date include 1) indexed artifact catalogs, and 2) statistical artifact listings. No special peripherals are
needed. For large assemblages (30,000+ records), the system works best when supplemented by a
hard drive unit. It can be converted to DOS systems via mode. Illustrations will include; a) Sample
of data entry card; b) Sample of programming sequence; c) Sample of disc record formats, d) Sample
of data entry formats; and e} Output samples.

THE USE OF A GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR CULTURAL RESOURCE SURVEY,
EVALUATION, AND PLANNING AT FORT DRUM, NEW YORK
As part of overall cultural resource planning and impact analysis associated with the construction
of facilities to install the 10th Mountain Division at Fort Drum, New York, a computer based
Geographic Information System (GIS) was developed. The GIS was based upon a series of environ-
mental and cultural variables including soil drainage characteristics, slope, distance to water, location
of historic roadways, location of sites on historical maps and the nature of subsurface disturbance.
Both prehistoric and historic archaeological sensitivity models were generated for the study area.
These models were combined with the ground distrubance models to generate a set of requirements
for feld survey. The GIS is currently being used to guide decisions concerning appropriate field
strategies and to aid planners in avoiding archacologically sensitive areas. It is expected that the GIS
, “a

will eventually be expanded to encompass the entire fort and will be constantly updated with infor-
mation related to site locations, ground disturbance, and levels of anticipated impact.

The poster presentation will depict various aspects of the model development and will relate the
computer application to specific archaeological considerations. The session will also emphasize the
<ooperative nature of the planning process which has involved data input from numerous sources.

PREDICTIVE MODELS FOR HISTORIC/PREHISTORIC SITE LOCATIONS WITH A
GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM

Researchers at the U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboaratoy have developed a
Geographic Information System (GIS) which is used at military installations for land management &
environmental planning applications. One capability of a GIS is to identify the relationships between
historic/prehistoric site locations and combinations of landscape features, then to generate maps
predicting “likelihood Zones” for sites based on these landscape reltionships.

Historic & prehistoric sites on federal lands are protected by federal laws & departmental regula-
tions. To protect sites, land managers need to identify areas where sites occur. Generally, however,
only a small fraction of lands are surveyed, Predictive modeling provides a tool to identify likely areas
to occur {or not occur) on unsurveyed lands.

EMPIRICAL DETERMINATION OF LOCAL CLIMATE SEQUENCES

Empirical determination of local climate sequences is at na resolution often difficult or impossible

ARCHAEOLOGICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM

SYS/pe is an archaeological information management and analysis system. It was designed specif-
ically for use by archacologists with no technical background in database management or computers,
yet provides the flexibility and power necessary for assisting in the interpretation of data. The system

can manage thousands of records, and extract specified information forjnquiries, graphics, or maps.
SYS/pc can also assist in collections management, by producing catalogs of recovered items by user
defined catagories, and by providing complete on-screen information access. Users can select infor:
mation for a report or graph using natural language parameters or through a user defined code set.
The system allows for rapid data entry with intensive verfication, requires minimal serup time, and
includes a complete tutorial.

AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA MANAGEMENT

The Office of Archaeological Excavation has devised a series of integrated entry masks using micro-
computer based software for the management of archaeological field and lab data. An artifact inventory
and catalog record developed for use on mainframe computers have been converted for the IBM PC/
XT. These records are linked by a unique provenience number so that field, lab, storage, and analytic
data may be easily retrieved for any given context. Two highly significant research tools for the
historical archaeolgist are discussed: a CAD system which will augument the office’s heavy drafting
needs and provide an efficient method for inter-site comparisons, and a prototype vessel and object
catalog video-disk system which will allow storage and retrieval of video images.

NPS NATIONAL ARCHEOLOGICAL DATABASE PROJECT

The National Park Service is developing a National Archeological Database to provide concerned
parties with access to information on the archeological products of Federal! projects. The system will
also assist the National Park Service in coordinating the National Archeological Program and in
preparing the annual report on this program for the Congress.

The system is designed to utilize a fully relationa) database management system and currently runs
on the microcomputer version of ORACLE, a relational DBMS. Data entry is facilitated through the
use of data entry screens or through the transfer of information from an existing computer system in
fixed-field ASCII formatted files. Responsibility for collection and maintenance of the database is
delegated to Mid-Atlantic, Rocky Mountain, Western and Southeast National Park Service Regional
Offices.

The National Archeological Database will be the first centralized source of reference to federally-
funded reports, projects and databases in the history of the discipline,

THE ANALYSIS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY

Diversity is a concept that is frequently used in archaeological interpretation. However, use of this

concept is complicated because most of the measures in use are highly dependent on sample size. A
method has been developed and implemented (on microcomputers) that controls for sample size in
the analysis of diversity, using two measures of diversity, richness and an information-theoretic
measure of evenness. The poster will point out the problem of sample size and, through applications
of this method show how it can be solved. It will also explore the relationships among several diversity
measures.

EDUCATIONAL COURSEWARE DEVELOPMENT IN ARCHAEOLOGY

We have developed an instructional courseware module which simulates the nature and distribution
of archaeological information. This module displays graphic and tabular data for a series of hypothet-
ical sites across an artificial landscape. By examining these sites and their contents, students learn to
identify patterns of differential land use.

This courseware has been implemented on the IBM-PC. By using high-resolution monochrome
graphics, a RAM virtual screen, and help sections, students can plot combinations of artifacts, types
of sites, and landscape variables.

The inspection and interpretation of visual data greatly enhances the appreciation and understand-
ing of archaeological information. Graphic simulation offers students an inexpensive and unique
method to inspect and interpret archacologica! data normally unavailable.
