[100] DIFFERENTIAL PARTICIPATION IN LOCAL EXCHANGE NETWORKS: EVIDENCE FOR
INCIPIENT SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AMONG THE CLASSIC PERIOD HOHOKAM
The exchanges of utilitarian pottery between Hohokam villages in the Phoenix area, Arizona,
during the Classic period were typically restricted to villages that cooperated in the operation of
irrigation canals, An exception is Pueblo Grande, perhaps the largest and most influential settlement
in the Phoenix Basin, which regularly received plainware pottery from beyond its canal system. Only
segments of the inhabitants at Pueblo Grande, however, participated in that exchange. These same
segments also had greater access to imported products made by specialists, suggesting status differen-
tials within the community that are consistent with incipient social stratification.

{98] THE PRODUCTION, USE, AND DISTRIBUTION OF METAVOLOCANIC RAW
MATERIAL FROM THE SLATE BELT: AN EXAMPLE FROM CENTRAL NORTH
CAROLINA
The Slate Belt is a group of fine-grained metavolcanic and sedimentary rocks of Precambrian to
Paleozoic age outcropping mainly from Virgimia to Georgia. This area was utilized during prehistory
4s a source of lithic raw material. Due to its geological complexity, little research has been directed
toward the identification of raw material types at individual lithic sources or the distribution of
these materials from their respective sources. This paper presents results of research regarding the
documentation and distribution of source-specific raw materials from a Slate Belt quarry in central
North Carolina, using an expedient, easily replicated methodology involving macroscopic variables.

{19] PROJECTILE POINTS AND MICROBLADES IN SOUTHWEST ALASKA
The early human occupation of Alaska between 11,000 and 10,000 years ago appears to be repre-
sented by (1) two seperate cultural assemblages, the Nenana, the earliest complex, with a bifacial
industry, but without microblades and the somewhat later Denali complex with microblades and
with—without an associated bifacial industry, or |2) a single cultural complex with the variation due
to seasonal or site specific variation. Data from artifact assemblages recovered from sites excavated
in non-glaciated areas of the central Kuskokwin River region during summer 1992 will be presented
as a further discussion of this question.

. [88] BY SEA OR BY LAND? THE EARLIEST IMMIGRANTS TO NORTH AMERICA
Speculations as to the origin and antiquity of the Native Peoples of North America pnor to
archeological investigations in Alaska and North Asia were limited only by the imagination of a
particular author. Claims for the landfall of ancient Middle Eastern, African, European or mythic
Atlantean/Muvian mariners and their establishment of civilizations in the New World have long
been advanced. Against this mythic backdrop, the equally amazing, but factual, story of the ancient
movement of peoples out of the vastness of Asia, across the Bering Land Bridge and imto North
America will be explored.

[90] PRE-MAIZE GARDENING IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS
Archaeobotanical data and bone isotopic studies combine to demonstrate that maize consumption
dominated the subsistence economies of Village period populations in the Central Plains. During
the preceding Woodland period, however, domesticates such as Helianthus annuus (sunflower), Iva
annua (marshelder), and Cucurbita pepo (squash) as well as wild plants and nuts, such as Chenopodium
sp. (goosefoot) and Juglans nigra (black walnut) are well represented in archaeobotanical samples.
These plant remains suggest a mixed gardening and plant collecting economy which contributed to
the development of a sedentary village lifestyle.

{100} WHY IS A KIVA? PREHISTORIC PITSTRUCTURES IN THE TAOS REGION,
NORTHERN NEW MEXICO
Building upon Watson Smith’s (1952) well-known article that asks “when is a kiva?,” this paper
utilizes both published and unpublished archaeological data from the northern Rio Grande region
12
, Albarracin-Jordan, Juan 13
to investigate the roles played by socially integrative structures {kivas) between A.D. 900-1500.
Traditionally, the dichotomy between pithouse and kiva has rested upon temporal and architectural
criteria. Functional implications of structure use (i.¢., domestic vs. religious) are then determined
based upon the architectural pedigree assigned to the structure. An alternative approach is proposed
that recognizes a continuum between “domestic” and ‘‘ritual’’ uses of pitstructures, avoiding many
of the typological pitfalls that continue to cloud the pithouse-kiva debate.

[64] TRASH PITS AND MIDDENS: ANOTHER LOOK AT DIFFERENTIAL SITE-USE
PATTERNS AT MEZHIRICH
Analyses of newly collected flotation samples from the ca. 15,000 B.P. Upper Paleolithic site of
Mezhirich in the Ukraine are focussed on identifying and characterizing differential site-use and
occupancy patterns. Samples collected from extramural trash pits are compared to materials extracted
from intact midden areas surrounding Dwelling 4. Differences in the kind and frequency of faunal,
floral, and artifactual materials are quantified and assessed in terms of on-site activities and behaviors.

[113] FOLSOM MOBILITY STRATEGIES VIEWED FROM WITHIN AND NEAR THE KNIFE
RIVER FLINT SOURCE AREA, NORTH DAKOTA
The Jensen Site at Lake Ilo, North Dakota, contains new data on the complete sequence of Folsom
biface manufacture in Knife River flint, from cobble quarrying to final fluting processes. Despite an
abundance of local high-quality flint, Folsom inhabitants also imported non-local lithic materials in
the form of early stage bifacial preforms. When augmented by lithic production data from locations
more distantly removed from the Knife River flint source area, a model positing high Folsom group
mobility with limited production for inter-group lithic exchange is supported.

[106] EARLY, MIDDLE, AND LATE ARCHAIC SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE AMERICAN
BOTTOM AND CENTRAL ILLINOIS
Archaic site distributions are examined from three survey projects-the Modoc locality (American
Bottom), Hunter Lake (upland central Illinois), and Panther Creek (near the confluence of the [linois
and Sangamon Rivers). Environmental vanables that may affect Archaic settlement patterns are
analyzed, and potential changes in environmental parameters are explored, Changes in Archaic
settlement patterns and potential environmental changes are examined to assess differential effects
of the Hypsithermal climatic episode. Environmental changes partially explain the settlement pattern
changes; cultural factors such as horticultural experimentation or population increases may also
affect both site location (settlement pattern) and organization of populations (settlement system).

[83] DIMENSIONS OF CHANGE IN PREHISTORIC PUEBLO RELIGION
Recent studies of prehistoric Pueblo religion have approached the subject as architectural history,
relating particularly to kivas, and as social history, relating particularly to social integration. This
paper returns to a more basic approach, one concerned with the “history of religion.” It discusses
dimensions of change in Pueblo religion and their potentjal archaeological correlates, including
patterning in kiva morphology. The paper begins, seeopetally, with Lamphere’s statement that
“Pueblo religion seems to be based on an essentially shamanistic world view adapted to the needs
of an agricultural people,” and it ends, chronologically, with the advent of the kachinas, ca. AD.

[53] AN EARLY CIRCULAR PLATFORM FROM CAHAL PECH, BELIZE
Round structures in Mesoamerica are relatively rare and have been ihterpreted in a variety of ways.
A round platform excavated at Cahal Pech appears to be one of the earliest of its type yet recorded
in the Maya lowlands, with a long sequence of use and modification. Artifacts and human remains
from the structure suggest that it served as a performative platform, likely in relation to ancestor
worship. From a broader perspective, the location, date, and formal qualities of this platform raise
important questions about the nature of early Maya monumentality.

[48] AYLLU AND THE PACAJES “CHULLPA”
The Pacajes Senorio, a post-Tiwanaku polity that flourished between A.D. 1100 and ca. 1540 in
the south Central Andes, utilized diverse funerary structures. These differences appear to be related
, 14 Alexander, Rani
to the dual partitioning of the polity into complementary segments, namely Uma-Pacajes and Urgu
Pacajes. This paper examines this variability and its implications for interpretations on the ayllu,
The ayllu is primarily evaluated in terms of its economic strategies and its political organization, as
inferred from the archaeological record and ethnohistoric as well as ethnographic documents, rather
than tracing it only through ancestor worship.

[76] THE POLITICAL LANDSCAPE AND SETTLEMENT ARCHAEOLOGY IN COLONIAL
PERIOD YAXCABA PARISH, YUCATAN, MEXICO
Colonial period settlement patterns in the Parish of Yaxcaba, Yucatan, Mexico are examined in
light of late eighteenth and early nincteenth century historic information in order to link Spanish
colonial economic organization to specific archaeological patterns. The dual colonial economy mani-
fests itself in the archaeological record at two levels: regional settlement organization and community
site structure, The organization of the settlement hicrarchy and differences in site structural patterns
among communities are related to variation in the strategies of risk reduction conditioned by a
settlement’s position, within the political landscape and its articulation with the larger colonial
economic system.

[80] FORM AND FUNCTION IN IROQUOIAN CERAMICS
Late Woodland ceramics in the eastern Great Lakes area are predominately a homogeneous group
of utilitarian earthenware with few overt (formal) indications of functional differences. Approximately
200 whole vessels from two contact period (ca AD 1610-1625) Seneca sites are analyzed. Variability
in form, volume, and evidence for use are examined for insight into functional differences in Lroquoian
ceramics,

[70] PATTERNS OF INTERACTION IN THE SOUTHERN COOK ISLANDS
The southern Cook Islands are a widely separated chain of eight islands covering 700 km in the
southeast Pacific. Recent archaeological! research on Aitutaki and other islands in the group indicate
that despite significant inter-island distances, communication was maintained between island com-
munities over a roughly five hundred year period (1000 to 1500 BP}. Subsequently, interaction net-
works appear to have deteriorated. This paper considers the extent, direction, and timing of these
patterns of interaction based on the distribution of two unevenly distributed raw materials, pearl-
shell (Pinctada margaritifea) and basalts. Conditions fostering early interaction and subsequent
isolation are also explored.

[28] RELATIONSHIP OF CARBON ISOTOPE RATIOS OF DIETARY PROTEIN AND ENERGY
TO THOSE OF BONE COLLAGEN AND APATITE
Dietary interpretation of stable carbon isotope ratios of prehistoric human bones is ambiguous.
Do carbon isotopes of bone collagen reflect the whole diet or dietary protein? Do those of bone
apatite reflect mainly energy (carbohydrates, fats) or the whole diet? Results of seven controlled diet
experiments, with protein and energy of different carbon isotope ratios, show that collagen mainly
reflects the isotopic composition of dietary protein but carbonate accurately reflects that of, the
whole diet. Collagen carbon isotopes substantially underestimate the isotopic composition of the
non-protein component of diets when protein and energy have different carbon isotope ratios.

[37] KATUN HISTORY IN THE CLASSIC MAYA LOWLANDS: EVIDENCE AND
IMPLICATIONS
Recently a number of authors have made reference to the Maya conception of history in an attempt
to understand the rituals and actions of Colonial Period and modern Mayas, They have focused on
the concept of katun history which embodies both ideas of history and prophesy. Hieroglyphic and
iconographic sources from the Classic Period suggest that this concept was not an invention of the
post-conquest Maya, but is part of a longer tradition. This paper will examine the Classic Period
evidence for katun history and explore its implications for the study of the archacological and
epigraphic records of the Maya.

[21] PATHWAYS TO INEQUALITY IN NORTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA

Current problems in explaining the evolution of social inequality on the Northwest Coast include
the causal relationships between stratification and 1} control of natural and social resources; 2) control
of labor (including institutionalized slavery, and the development of specialization, 3) wartare; 4)
sedentism and the formation of coresidential corporate groups; 5) storage; 6) population growth; 7)
regional dynamics; and 8) human nature. Disentangling these casual links is confounded by an
archaeological record which suggests both impressive cultural and social continuity and stability on
the one hand, and considerable social and economic change on the other.

[112] ROCK ART AND LAND-USE PATTERNS IN THE ARCHAIC SOUTHWEST; A CASE

STUDY IN THE UPPER BASIN, COCONINO COUNTY, ARIZONA

Little Archaic material culture has been recovered in the Upper Basin, an area just south of Grand
Canyon National Park in Arizona. A single rock-art site, however, provides some evidence concerning
Archaic occupation of the area. The site, MU 1000, is a small rock shelter containing 19 pictographs.
This paper employs stylistic, locational, and ethnographic data to interpret MU 1000's function and
the site’s role in Archaic land-use patterns. Results indicate the pictographs record the population's
movements through the Upper Basin in relation to their subsistence strategy.

170] HUMAN BONE MODIFICATION?: AN ISLAND EXAMPLE AND ITS IMPLICATIONS

Because of the presence of burial caves on Mangaia (Cook Islands, Polynesia) and the prevalence
ef ethnohistoric accounts of cannibalism, the human (n=47) and large mammal (n=397) fauna
recovered by the Mangaia project were examined fog signs of human intervention. All remains were
highly fragmented; most pieces were smaller than san, The largest site (Man-44) produced 22 human
bone fragments representing a minimum of § individuals (4 adult and 4 juvenile). All fauna exhibited
similar patterns of human modification (burning, peeling/fracturing and working) and were frequently
found in association. Only nonhuman bone exhibited rodent gnawing (12%) or cutmarks (0.02%).
Human bone was concentrated in younger levels (68%). The assemblages show clear evidence of
buman modification, however, the sample and fragment sizes preclude suppositions as to the ultimate
goal of such intervention.

{57] CLAY SOURCING AT K’AXOB BELIZE ,

Sherds from the Middle and Late Preclassic period from K’axob Belize are compared to clays from
the region using petrographic analysis as the primary investigative tool. The findings give evidence
of change over time both in technology and in the clay sources being exploited, Additional variation
in the appearance of clays and sherds seems to be related to variation in firing temperatures. These
findings suggest very localized production of Preclassic vessels which were shaped and decorated in
= manner consonant with the Lowland tradition of Lopez Mamom and Cocos Chicanel ceramic
complexes.

In 1978 the Pueblo of Zuni embarked on a long term campaign to repatriate its War Gods. Several
key elements of the Zuni War God repatriation position were incorporated into the Native American

Zuni Tribe on the proper care and treatment of a range of cultural property and ancestral human
remains. The complexity of Zuni positions and the process by which tribal policies are developed
provide a cogent example of why repatriation issues should be resolved on a case by case basis.

[77] IN VINO VERITAS: PERISHABLE EXOTICA IN EARLY IRON AGE TRADE BETWEEN

THE WEST HALLSTATT ZONE AND THE MEDITERRANEAN

Discussions of prestige good economies tend to focus on the role of nonperishable exotic imports.
Perishable exotica are a less well understood vehicle of intercultural exchange, of significant value
in understanding the transformative nature of trade on partners at both ends of the trade network,
Sumptuary restrictions played a significant role in early Iron Age society in west-central Europe.
Wine seems to have been one of the most important of the perishable exotica involved in the exchange
between the West Hallstatt area and the Mediterrancan, and this paper will examine the role it played
in the socio-economic life of the early Lron Age.

[21] INEQUALITY, MARGINALIZATION, AND ECONOMICS

Emerging elites may guide economic developments in various ways. For instance, while some
elites accrue information, privileges, and status markers for themselves, they bring economically
dependent sectors of the population-such as craft or subsistence specialists-into core spheres of
production activity while simultaneously marginalizing them from positions of real political/eco-
nomic influence. If elites control information or technology critical to economic success and they
orchestrate networks of interdependencies which limit individual power, they effectively perpetuate
inequality. Common sources of power include control over labor, information, resources, and transpor-
tation.

[7] DOMESTIC ACTIVITIES AND HOUSELOT ORGANIZATION IN THE SIERRA DE LOS

TUXTLAS, VERACRUZ, MEXICO

The remains of sedentary, agricultural communities constitute the majority of the Mesoamerican
archaeological record. Establishing dependable links between the organization of such domestic
spaces and their resultant material patterns is thus crucial. This paper presents site structural data
collected from-a sample of residential houselots in southern Veracruz, Mexico. Surface artifact distribu-

‘ tions are used to explore the effects of activity organization on the spatial and compositional! character

of the material record. The results underscore how the nature of the task and the available area
within the houselot serve to structure domestic activities and influence material deposition.

[9] A SYNTHESIS OF THE CHINCHORRO CULTURE

The Chinchorro were fishermen who inhabited the coast of southern Peru and northern Chile and
had the oldest system of artificial mummification in the world (6,000-2,000 B.C.). Red, Black, Bandage,
Mud-coated, and Natural mummics were the main mummy styles, which correlataed to changes
through time. These mortuary practices implied they were deeply concerned with the afterlife and
ancestral worship. Their subsistence led to many health problems such as spondylolysis and auditory
exostosis, Treponematosis lesions observed on their tibias were probably related to their mummifica-
tion practices.

geologist. In a recent survey of an alluvial fan in eastern Iowa, a geological coring program provided
stratigraphic descriptions that were both used and expanded upon during subsequent archaeological
testing. The geoarchaeological survey resulted in a detailed illustration of alluvial fan aggradation,
and established a stratigraphic framework for the site’s Late Woodland through Middle Archaic
cultural record.

f90] EVOLUTION AND DOMESTICATION OF THE COMMON SUNFLOWER (HELIANTHUS
ANNUUS)

Forty years ago, Charles B. Heiser, Jr. proposed a scenario for evolution and domestication of
common sunflower (Helianthus annuus). Before humans arrived, its wild range was restricted to the
West. Subsequently, it became a weedy campfollower and expanded into the East. There a more
mebust weed form evolved, which was taken into cultivation and gradually domesticated. This paper
reviews Heiser’s model from phytogeographical and archaeological perspectives. Common sunflower,
is concluded, was native to natural disturbances on the Plains. East of Kansas and Nebraska, it
would not have persisted prehistorically without occasional saving and sowing of seed by humans.

[61] PHYTOLITH MORPHOMETRICS: THE USE IMAGE ANALYSIS FOR MORPHOLOGIC
AND SYSTEMATIC STUDY OF WHEAT PHYTOLITHS

The use of Computer-Assisted Image Analysis Systems (LAS) and morphometrics has the potential
to become a new paradigm for phytolith systematics. This paper presents two studies which incorpo-
rate IAS and morphometrics. The first study evaluates the morphometric and typological differences
between phytoliths extracted for the culms, laminae, and inflorescence bracts of Triticum monococ-
com. Results indicate that some unique types of phytoliths are produced in lamina and inflorescence
tissue. Moreover, silica cell phytoliths produced in lamina tissue are significantly larger (p < 0.05).
The second study presents two taxomonic tools developed for identification of three neolithic wheat
cultivars based on the morphometries of their respective phytoliths. The first tool is a key which
uses the means of phytolith morphometries as discriminators between the taxa. The second tool is
a set of discriminant functions based on several phytolith morphometries.

MEDICINE CREEK DRAINAGE, SOUTHWESTERN NEBRASKA

This paper compares the assemblages from the Allen, Lime Creek, and Red Smoke sites, all dated
between 10,800 and 8000 BP and all located within a mile of one another. Lithic and faunal assemblages
vary greatly among these three sites: the Allen site seems to have been a residential location but
Lime Creek and Red Smoke produced more specialized assemblages tied to stone tool production,
suggesting very local variation in site use. Over time the Allen site comes more and more to resemble
Lime Creek and Red Smoke. This trends probably reflects a trend towards increasing residential
mobility over time.

[78] STATE COLLAPSE IN EGYPT IN THE LATE THIRD MILLENIUM B.C,

During the last two dynasties of Egypt’s Old Kingdom sociopolitical “pathologies” are seen which
caused major economic problems for the centralized state. The state finally collapsed at the end of
Dyn. 6, ca. 2181 B.C., followed by a period of political fragmentation known as the First Intermediate
Period. Climatic change during the late 3rd millennium B.C. may have exacerbated the socio-political
pathologies that led to the collapse of the Old Kingdom, Given a greatly increased population during
the Old Kingdom, lower agricultural productivity as a result of disastrously low Nile floods and less
floodplain land under cultivation caused widespread famine and anarchy.

Coles Creck polities have been interpreted in a variety of ways by different researchers, each

Ways in which these constructs have influenced interpretations of the complexity of Coles Creek

to marginal cases often not only suppresses significant variation within stages, but masks commonali-
ties between them as well. One such commonality, the role played by political centers in the
production and reproduction of social asymmetries in the Lower Mississippi Valley, is examined,

The archaeological sequence of late Pleistocene industries in the, Near Fast is quite well known.
in spite of the relatively small number of excavated sites, art objects are scarce. The number increases
at the closing millennia (e.g., in the Natufian culture). The use of the ‘stress model’ that wasdocu-

East or North Africa. Recorded periods of harsh climatic and social conditions during the 45-13 k

{103] EARLY NAVAJO OCCUPATION OF THE GRAND CANYON REGION

It is often assumed that Navajos moved into the western margins of Navajo land during the 19th
century and used the Grand Canyon to escape from the United States Army during its campaign
against Navajos in the 1860s. Archaeological data collected during investigations for the Navajo land
claims before the Indian Claims Commission in the 1950s and 1960s, and oral history collected
during the ongoing Glen Canyon Environmental Studies/Navajo Cultural Resources Project indicate
that the Navajos’ Athabaskan ancestors were using the Grand Canyon and surrounding region by
the late 1600s. This paper summarizes the archaeological and ethnohistorical data supporting an
early Navajo occupation of the Grand Canyon region and discusses implications for early Navajo
migrations.

[86] THE TROUBLE WITH TRADITIONAL CULTURAL PROPERTIES: PRACTICAL
CONSIDERATIONS OF MANAGING THE NAVAJO NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT
CULTURAL RESOURCES

The Navajo Nation has been actively involved in managing and protecting ‘Traditional Cultural

Properties” (TCP) since 1988. The publication of National Register Bulletin 38 has made consideration

of TCPs a general issue in cultural resource management. Many archaeologists and cultural resource

managers are deeply perplexed about how to deal with TCPs. The Navajo Nation’s experience demon-
strates that TCPs are not the PROBLEM. To demonstrate this, the policy issues pertaining to identifi-
cation, evaluation and management of TCPs are examined from the perspective of the Navajo Nation.

The practical concerns with applying these policies are detailed.

[9] BIOARCHAEOLOGICAL TEST OF THE SELECTIONIST HYPOTHESES

The Darwinian concept of selection has been extended to artifactual variation, where changes in
frequencies are explained as changes of an “extended” phenotype. Changes in skeletal health over
time measure results of possible selective forces. Changes in life expectancies and population size
alone can track absolute selection. Arguments must link indicators of health and population structure
with changes in artifactual variation if selection is to be a useful tool for describing human adaptation
from material remains. Temporal changes in ceremony, activity, and technology are linked to changes

—in health, fertility, and life expectancy among successive populations at the Preceramic site of Paloma,
Pera.

A survey of ch‘ullpas on the Kachighata slope in the vicinity of Ollantaytambo in the Cusco
department was complemented by a survey of ch’ullpas by Markaqocha in the Patakancha gorge in
the same district. Architectonical features such as shape, size, building materials and orientation
were studied and surface finds such as bones and ceramics recorded. From the Kachighata chambers,
samples were collected for dating purposes. The Kachiqhata ch’ullpas’ relationship with the prehis-
toric stonework on that slope is also discussed, The results help to clarify characteristics and cultural
belonging of a type of ch’ullpa in the Central Andes.

[92] A DECADE OF CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY FOR THE U.S. ARMY ENGINEER
DISTRICT, LITTLE ROCK: A CONTRACTOR'S PERSPECTIVE

This video presentation chronicles the development and application of new technologies, methods,
and theories from 1982-1992, a period when Archeological Assessments, Inc. served as the major
provider of cultural resource management services to the Army Engineer District, Little Rock. During
this period a new cultural resource management paradigm emerged. This shift from a “site-based”’
archaeology to a paradigm in which the archaeological record is understood as the sum total of human
alterations to the landscape has important consequences for the ways in which researchers and federal
land managers collect, interpret, and disseminate archaeological data.

|109] GAINING AND MAINTAINING LOCAL GOVERNMENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL POLICY
IN PENSACOLA, FLORIDA
Pensacola is the oldest settlement in the U.S., but until 1981, it’s archaeological deposits were
being destroyed at an alarming rate. In 1985, under public pressure, the city passed a local version
of NHPA Section 106. Maintaining and enforcing this public policy has been surprisingly difficult.
in general, elected officials and outside contractors support and comply with the ordinance. However,
city management and staff constantly try to ignore the ordinance by planning construction and
maintenance projects without going through the compliance process. Advocates of archaeology must
cantinue to be “watch dogs” and force enforcement of the ordinance.

34] MEASURING HOLOCENE ADAPTIVE CHANGE IN THE WESTERN GREAT BASIN
Evidence for local prehistoric adaptive change is commonplace in the western Great Basin. In many
lecalities, the long-term trend is toward systems that are spatially less extensive and economically
sore diverse and intensive. In subsistence, this is expressed more by change in mode and context
of procurement and processing [i.c.,subsistence technology) than in range of resources used, which
semained relatively stable. Evolutionary ecology, via foraging theory, offers a rudimentary interpretive
framework for understanding these large-scale, directional trends in subsistence technology. Culture
cramsmission theory explicates in more detail the mechanisms through change was accomplished.

[89] MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC BUTCHERY AT SHANIDAR CAVE
The Middle Paleolithic levels of Shanidar Cave (Layer D}, excavated by Ralph S. Solecki, contained
the skeletons of nine Neanderthal individuals, a large Mousterian lithic assemblage, and a substantial
collection of animal bones. Although the animal bones were identified, the butchery had not been
studied in detail. An examination of the cut-marks suggests that the lower limb clements of wild
goat (Capra aegagrus), the most commonly found species, served either as a source of tendons or
carefully skinned pelts. These possibilities suggest that the Shanidar Neanderthals possessed a more
complex material culture than that indicated by the lithics alone.

[3] DESECRATION OF HOPI SACRED SITES IN NAVAJO-PARTITIONED LANDS

There has been increasing interest in involving Native Americans in the identification and manage-

as coming from development projects; it has generally not been recognized that Native American
sacred sites can be threatened by the actions of other tribal groups. This paper discusses several Hopi
sacred sites that have been desecrated by ongoing activities in Navajo-partitioned lands near the
Hopi reservation in northeastern Arizona. Implications of these cases for the preservation ethic and
for implementation of federal preservation laws are considered.

[112] FORAGERS AND COLLECTORS AS TWO EXTREMES: WHAT LIES BETWEEN THE

The Forager-Collector Model is commonly used in the reconstruction of prehistoric hunter-gatherer
land-use. It is often noted that foragers and collectors represent two extremes on a continuum.
However, what lies berween these two extremes has seldom been explored. In this paper, the middle
ground between foragers and collectors is investigated. In many prehistoric environments, this middle
ground may represent a more common set of strategies than generally recognized by archacologists.
The Middle Archaic occupation of the Hayes Site (40ML139) is offered as one possible example of a
prehistoric group employing a middle strategy as opposed to one of the two extremes,

Recent federal laws and regulations concerning Native American issues have vastly increased
demands upon tribal infrastructures, federal agencies, private industry, and archeologists. Independent
federal laws with the same general goal-consideration of Native American concerns are triggered at
successive and not always compatible points in federal undertakings. This results in a complex
matrix of consultations which are sometimes redAndant, involving meetings, field surveys, review
of extensive technical documents, and detailed written communication between tribes and agencies,
which is rapidly overwhelming the administrative capabilities of all parties. An integrated approach

[40] ANIMAL BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR AS INDICATORS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE
FUNCTION

Many studies of prehistoric Native American hunters and fishers in the Northeast have focused
on the cultural geography of these peoples to the exclusion of the niche geography of their prey.
Local edaphic factors and inventories of preserved faunal remains are frequently used to generate
models of resource scheduling and A5 indicators of archaeological site function without consideration
for the behavior and ecology of these species nor the taphonomy of their remains, This paper discusses
how biologically-based studies of the behavior and ecology of deer and anadromous fish, in conjunction
with taphonomic and archaeological data, were used to understand the placement and function of
two archaeological site complexes in the Delaware River Valley and generate more realistic models
of prehistoric human subsistence and settlement in the Delaware River Valley,

[59] FOOD AND METAL: SOCIAL COMPLEXITY IN SOUTHEASTERN ENGLAND 1000-700
B.C.

The Late Bronze Age of western Europe (1200-700 BC) is generally presented as a period of increasing
social complexity, with particular emphasis on agricultural intensification and the production and
circulation of prestige goods. Despite widespread homogeneity of material culture and technology,
there was considerable regional variation in social organization. Recent excavations of settlements
in southeastern England have produced the first good evidence for domestic architecture and the
patterning of material culture deposition. This evidence suggests that the relationship between
material culture and social organization is more complicated than hitherto appreciated, and makes
problematic the ascription of degrees of social complexity.

[56] NEW DIRECTIONS IN SETTLEMENT PATTERN STUDIES: AN
ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE

Settlement pattern studies in archaeology are based on geographical and ecological models. In the
1960s settlement archaeology often relied upon taxonomies of ideal site types which represented
behavioral units of human spatial organization. The distribution of archaeological places in pastoral
and agricultural systems across contemporary landscapes do not conform to site type taxonomies
nor can they be explained only through traditional models of settlement. Ethnoarchaeology provides
some new directions for examining different scales of spatial distributions across landscapes.

Considerations of Classic Maya polities are often limited to epigraphic studies or settlement

dynamics. The conjunction of archaeological data from the Belize Valley and Caracol |its powerful
neighbor to the south) permit both the generation of alternative archacological models for the interpre-
tation of polities and political boundaries and a consideration of the changing nature of these units

PREHISTORIC HUMAN BURIALS

isotopic data obtained from Jomon Period human burials reveal diet differences between populations
levying in coastal and inland locales near each other, and indicate differences in resource exploitation.
In some cases people who live in coastal sites appear to have relied more heavily on inland resources
than was previously presumed. Differing isotope ratios for males and females in some sites indicate
possible differences in subsistence role, Yayoi Period burial results indicate that the differences in
diet, and hence in resource exploitation, had disappeared, and that diet had become more homogeneous
throughout much of Japan.

however, will be necessary for adequate investigation of such areas as large interior bajos. Some of
the methods tested by the authors at Rio Azul, Guatemala, are introduced as examples.

18] CORN AGAIN TONIGHT? A NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS OF AN ANASAZI DIET
Coprolites from a Pueblo II occupation of Hoy House and Lion House in Johnson Canyon, Colorado
memmediately to the south of Mesa Verde were examined for pollen, macrofloral, and faunal remains.
, 36 Cummings, Linda Scott
A descriptive report of the pollen contents of these coprolites has been published previously (Scott
1979). Stiger (1977) describes the macrofloral and faunal contents of these same coprolites, as well
as the parasite record, Common and occasional elements of the diet are identified. Diets, as represented
by these data bases, are examined for nutritional completeness. Probable nutritional deficiencies,
deficiency-related diseases, and strengths of the diet are noted and discussed. It addresses the nutn-
tional consequences of both a hypothetical varied diet, as well as one heavily reliant on agricultural
produce, to the local population.

Coprolites from Peru, Nubia, and the American Southwest are compared and contrasted for phytolith
evidence of diet. All three sets of coprolites have companion pollen evidence of food and leave different

[18] THE EXCAVATION, STRATIGRAPHY, AND CHRONOMETRICS OF PENDEJO CAVE,
NEW MEXICO
Pendejo Cave, in south-central New Mexico, has yielded stratified deposits approaching 3 meters
in depth with at least 25 different strata. Excavation of 2/3 of the cave utilized the La Perra technique
and spanned three seasons, 1990-1992, A solid continuum of chronometric dates has been established
which demonstrate the integrity of the deposits. Dates below zone C2A to O are pre-Clovis in age.
Chronological evaluation of the discrete cave data are based on C-14, TL, and faunal association.
The conduct of the excavations, the integrity of the stratigraphy, the chronometrics, coupled with
other analyses has substantially enhanced the understanding of pre-Clovis habitat.

Recent paleoenvironmental reconstructions based on geology, palynology, packrat midden analysis,
aed dendrochronology specify Southwestern environmental fluctuations at several different wave-

[73] ZONAL COMPLEMENTARITY AND OTHER SOCIO-ECONOMIC STRATEGIES IN THE |
SOUTHERN ANDES: A CRITICAL REVIEW

The modern history of Andean ethnographical and archacological investigations 1s a succession of
different interpretative models of socio-economic strategies (e.g., wanshumance, verticality, zonal
complementarity}. These perennial models affect the conduct of archaeological inquiry, yet archaeolo-
gists reluctantly assess them critically, The use and implication of these models are explored and
illustrated with examples drawn from several areas of the Andes. The strength of these models lies

in their potential ability to explain the distribution of non-local resources and cultural traits. Their

weakness lies in their neglect of local development and in their repetitive dependence on interpretative

convention. To make more effective use of these (and other, as yet, formulated) models and to reduce
their debilitating effects on the interpretation of archacological variability, we encourage more critical
self-reflection of and more attention paid to the application of archaeologic knowledge.

{a6} SOLIDARITY THROUGH DEATH? THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF COLLECTIVE BURIAL

RITUALS

Despite the increased emphasis placed upon mortuary analysis over the past twenty years, relatively
Serle theoretical attention has been given to the phenomenon of collective burial ritual. This paper
eeviews current interpretation of such mortuary rituals and evaluates their analytical potential for
cemtributing to explanations of long-term cultural stability and change. Archaeologists usually assign
am integrative social function to collective burials, assuming that the ritual manipulation and disposal
of multiple dead creates an egalitarian solidarity for both the dead and living. Drawing upon recent,
pest-structuralist theories of ritual, I argue that this line of interpretation circumscribes the analytical
capability of the rituals, because it presumes incorrectly that they work primarily to overcome social
ferences rather than to maintain or produce them. Recasting collective burial rituals as arenas of
sectal contradiction and potential transformation helps to account for the simultaneous emergence
of ewo different forms of these rituals in Virginia during the late prehistoric period (ca. 900-1600

by environmental factors. While the prevalence of terracing is clearly associated wi aes Classic
population growth, it was strongly conditioned by environmental vanability. Vanation in the form
@ terracing employed at a given location was the result of environmental adaptation and incremental
evolution. Data from the Petexbatun, Vaca Plateau, Rio Bravo, Rio Bec, and Puuc Hills regions are
qresented. The role of terracing or lack of terracing in slope management and its relationship with
seconded variation in ancient soil erosion and sedimentation are also considered.

Ss) TECHNIQUES FOR IDENTIFYING TREE SOURCE AREAS, PART 2

As least 200,000 trees were used in the construction of the buildings in Chaco Canyon, AD 900-
1200. Tree species used in construction are not present in the canyon today and may not have been
geesent during the AD 900-1200 period. It has established that modern tree stands vary geochemically.
‘Ths paper presents the result of geochemical analyses of prehistoric wood samples from Chaco
(Gampypon. These results are compared with the chemical signatures from previously analyzed modern

|77] POTTERY AND PROGRESS: THE ROMAN CERAMIC INDUSTRY AND SETTLEMENT
GROWTH
Roman ceramic production represented one of the most complicated proto-industrial system that
ever existed. Production was in the millions and the distribution networks extended over hundreds
of miles. It operated on several quality levels. The sale of these ceramic products to all groups in
Roman provincial society was a major stimulus to the development of a market economy. Much of
this activity was centered in Western Europe during the first-third centuries A.D. This paper will
look at the ceramic production and distribution in relation to the growth of settlements in Roman
Gaul, Germany, and Britain. In conclusion, some comparisons will be made with the emergence of
industrial ceramic production in eighteenth century England.

EXPANSION INTO THE CALCHAQUI VALLEY
A central reason for the Inka expansion into the Calchaqui Valley was to procure wealth objects
for state finance. Evidence from the Inka site Potrero de Payogasta shows development of attached
specialization. Manufacturing of gold and copper items, beads of marine shell, malachite, and human
teeth, and mica disks, occurred throughout residential areas, but was concentrated in elite-associated
households. Craftwork at the local settlement Valdéz was apparently limited, except for preliminary
processing of copper into ingots. The state therefore apparently monopolized key steps in wealth
production, Some wealth was locally distributed, but metal goods were apparently moved long
distances for state distribution.

Archaeological research in Polynesia has demonstrated the impact that humans have had on the
island environments they inhabited, and the reciprocal effects that changing local environments had
on island cultures. The impact of changing environments on social organization, however, requires
further investigation in the remains of prehistoric households and communities. Recent research on

[43] PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTIONS USING STABLE ISOTOPE ANALYSIS
OF LATE QUATERNARY CARBONATES

Analysis of carbon and oxygen isotopes on pedogenic, lacustrine and spring carbonates is an effective
approach for paleoenvironmental analysis associated with geoarchacological projects. Especially when
coupled with detailed sedimentology and pedology in the field, isotopic data constitute proxy records
of plant biomass (carbon isotopes}. Carbonates are often contained in sediments that lack other biotic
data such as pollen; therefore isotopic analysis of carbonates may be applicable and comparable over
large regions, However, isotopic analysis must be done as part of a rigorous research strategy that
includes reconstruction of pedogenic and sedimentary histories, as well as analysis of associated
organic components of the geologic record. These methods offer significant potential for intra- and
inter-regional environmental reconstructions in the late Pleistocene and Holocene.

§8| THE VALUE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL PLANT REMAINS FOR PALEODIETARY

RECONSTRUCTION

Macrobotanical remains have been considered relatively poor indicators of diet due to the complexi-
ces of differential deposition and preservation. In spite of these problematic factors, paleoethnobotani-
cal studies are crucial for understanding prehistoric subsistence. Paleofeces, though limitedito special
context, remain the best direct source of information about plant consumption. Although flotation-
recovered assemblages of carbonized plant parts from open sites do not reveal proportions of specific
food sources in the diet, they do allow interpretation of chronological trends and regional variations.

: This potential can be demonstrated using recent studies from eastern North America, where macrobo-

tanical remains provide key information concerning agricultural evolution that stable carbon isotope
research has failed to detect.

ALASKA: PROBLEMS, PROSPECTS, PROGNOSIS
The National Park Service, U.S. Geological Survey and Smithsonian Institution conducted recon-
naissance survey in 1992 of geomorphic features associated with Glacial Lake Noatak (GLN). Formed
when glaciers in the DeLong Mountains dammed the Noatak River during the Pleistocene, GLN
affected the Pleistocene paleogeography of northwestem Alaska and also influenced early Holocene
to modem environments. Over 90 new archaeological sites were identified; at several, core and blade
technology 15 apparently associated with well-formed lanceolate projectile ports. Findings suggest
that the pre-4,100 B.P. record at the halcyon Onion Portage Site on the Kobuk River may not be

One artifact type commonly associated with the Moundville site in Alabama 1s the “sreenstone”’
petaloid celt. Although celts were made from rock types that vary greatly in colors and textures,
the majonty are composed of an actinolite-epidote-albite-chlorite greenschist (metabasite} probably
obtained from the Hillabee Formation. Preliminary field evidence suggests that the main sources of
this “greenstone” are located in Clay and Chilton Counties, Alabama.

modern hominids. A gample of cave bear (Ursus spelaeus) fossils from Pod hradem, Czechoslovakia,
was examined to see if any spatial patterns existed, and if so, to infer the processes by which they
came to be.

[36] BIOGENIC VARNISH ON ANCIENT POTTERY AND STONE ARTIFACTS

The manganese and iron rich natural coatings deposited on ancient rocks {rock varnish) and ancient

pottery, were studied on artifacts from Guaytan, Guatemala, and from Michoacan, Mexico. These

deposits were analyzed using: bacterial and fungal culture media, energy dispersive X-ray spectros:

copy, Fourier-Transform infrared spectrography, optical microscopy, polarized light microscopy, scan-

ning electron microscopy, ultraviolet fluorescence, wavelength dispersive spectroscopy , and wet

chemical reactions.

The different components in the two types of natural accretions are described. The coatings on
ancient pottery were richer in manganese. Several bacterial groups and microcolonial black fungi
(MCF) were found encapsulated in the varnish.

EXAMPLE FROM THE DASSANETCH OF KENYA

Dassanetch of northern Kenya feed themselves through pastoralism, horticulture, fishing, hunting
of lacustrine vertebrates, and scavenging, in differing combinations, according to household composi-
tion and fortunes, location of key resources, and temporal variations in the resource base. Each
strategy requires different mobility, personnel and labor allocations, and extractive tactics. On-the-
ground patterns of features, implements, manufacturing debris, and food refuse at sites of differing
economic functions reflect variations in these factors. The relationship of human behaviors to site
size and “activity areas” and other types of clustering is explored.

{12} FROM BANDELIER’S CEMETERIES TO A BLACKWARE HORIZON, ONE STEP
TOWARDS A TIWANAKU CERAMIC CHRONOLOGY

Despite ambitious advances in the archaeology of the Tiwanaku civilization, its ceramic sequence
is still treated like pornography: no one can define it, but everyone ‘knows it when they see it’”’,
The lack of an explicit chronology for seven centuries of Tiwanaku’s high ceramic tradition inhibits
understanding of this important early state society.

Specific blackware serving vessels comprise a regionally and chronologically diagnostic component
of the Tiwanaku ceramic inventory. Ceramics from Bandelier’s cemeteries of Ciriapata and Titin-

[55] EVOLUTION OF MAMMAL COMMUNITIES IN THE CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI RIVER
VALLEY AND PLEISTOCENE/HOLOCENE HUMAN SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES
Late Pleistocene mammal communities of the Central Mississippi River Valley are characterized
by megafauna and contemporaneous sympatry of small mammal species without modern analogs.
At the end of the Pleistocene, most megafauna species, which served as potential resources for human
populations, became extinct. Also, at the same time, modern mamma! community patterns began
to emerge through the individualistic response of specics to changing environmental conditions,
primarily global warming. Both the extinction event and the reorganization of mammalian communi-
tics may have resulted from changes in patchiness of the environmental mosaic, Consequences for
human subsistence strategies would have been shifting resource bases and reduced mobility during
the transition from Paleoindian to Archaic economies.

DISTRIBUTION
Many models of carcass part distribution applied to faunal samples in the Near East assume that
ancient value systems placed on carcass parts are efficiency based. These models equate higher
meat yields per carcass part with higher value. An emic approach to this problem, based on recent
ethnographic data from Druze villagers, reveals that efficiency has little to do with valuation, When
cultural values such as consumer preference, cooking methods, and the cultural implications of food
consumption are considered, the resulting model of carcass part distribution differs markedly from
efficiency based models.

The interpretaion of a ‘creative explosion” accompanying anatomically modern peoples (AMP) in

Europe around 40,000 years ago accepted a phylogenetic heritage trom Neanderthals. More recent
evidence suggests that AMP (osteologically) originated much earlier outside Europe. The arrival of
AMP taphonomically created the appearance of an explosion. Rather, the change was possibly more
gradual, the most explosive cultural change being at the start of the Holocene. Our image of the
magico-religious functions of the Paleolithic art obscure this profound shift from empirical-based
Paleolithic reality to that of Holocene tribal cultures. Visual art best exemplifies this juncture,
changing from literal representational forms to more abstract symbolic patterns.

[33] THE NATURE OF MISSISSIPPIAN TOWNS IN GEORGIA

Only two Mississippian towns in Georgia-King and Rucker’s Bottom-have been excavated exten-
sively enough to yield evidence of overal! settlement layout. Of these, only the settlement plan at
King can be readily interpreted and fit into a larger regional settlement pattern context. At King, it
is possible to identify: a basic household architectural oa an emphasis on household identity
and persistence through time; growth in the size of individual households through time; high status
residential areas; and evidence of town planning.

[11] RECENT INVESTIGATIONS AT CHARLIE LAKE CAVE (HBRF 39): IMPLICATIONS FOR

OUR UNDERSTANDING OF SUBARCTIC PALEOINDIAN PREHISTORY

Recently expanded excavations at the deeply stratified site of Charlie Lake Cave (HbRE 39) in
northeastern British Columbia have provided additional information concerning Palaeoindian occupa:
tions in this region. Component 1, dated to 10,500 BP, contains a multiple basally fluted chert point,
stone bead (previously discussed in Fladmark, Driver, and Alexander 1988), a few retouched chert
flakes, and a large number of quartzite core and flake tools. Component 3, dated to 9,500 BP, contains
160 bifacial retouch flakes and a tabular chert microblade core. The implications of these two
assemblages are evaluated within the context of other fluted point and microblade assemblages within
the Subartic.

|60] SETTLEMENT STUDIES IN LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA: PAST TRENDS AND FUTURE
DIRECTIONS
Well into the second half of the 20th century, lower Central America was viewed, most often, as
a conduit for trade and migration between the high cultural areas of Mesoamerica and the Andes.
Archaeological research focused on the excavation of sites, oftentimes a cemetery. A shift in emphasis
to regional studies began in the 1970's, Shortly thereafter, projects involved random sampling designs
which provided the site distributional data necessary to examine regional settlement patterns. In
this paper we (1) review the history of settlement studies in lower Central America, and (2) discuss the
direction(s) in which we anticipate such studies will go to maximize their analytical and interpretive
potential. By example, we refer to site survey data from the Santa Maria River drainage of Central
Panama and a geographic information systems (GIS) approach.

[20] ASHANINKA SETTLEMENT IN THE UPPER MONTANA OF PERU
Historically, the territory of the lowland Ashaninka (Campa) of eastern Peru extended far into the
Andean foothills, where relations with hispanic colonists were frequently hostile. While much has
been written about this tumultuous relationship, less is known about Ashaninka interaction with
indigenous highland groups just above them. A widespread ceramic tradition reported in several
eastern valleys provides evidence for prehistoric Ashaninka occupation close to contemporary high-
land outposts. Systematic survey in one valley in particular, the Chanchamayo, gives some indication
of Ashaninka settlement patterns at the upper limits of their range, especially in relation to better
known highland colonization from above.

[21] PATHWAYS TO POWER: PRINCIPLES FOR CREATING SOCIOECONOMIC

INEQUALITIES

The initial emergence of socioeconomic inequality and hierarchies can best be viewed as emerging
under conditions of normal relative resource abundance and involving the consent of community
members . Possible pathways for converting surpluses into power and wealth inequalities include:
simple increased production; use of surplus for exchanging exotica; use of surplus for individual
loans; competitive feasting; and profiting from individuals’ misfortunes. Some of these pathways are
logically far more effective than others; contractual agreements are fundamental to many. Depending
on resource characteristics, power and wealth hierarchies can be structured either via the creation
of corporate groups or via the organization of independent households. Some labor is organized to
produce prestige as well as practical technologies in most pathways as part of the strategy to generate
inequalities.

site types, ie., small mounds, large accretional mounds, and open sites. Regional variability is
examined through a controlled comparison of artifact and feature content and context. Results
indicate that while there are some common regional patterns in these variables, there are also
pronounced differences. This suggests a highly localized interpretation of the common elements of

Competition over resources in the face of population growth is a key aspect of the aggregation
model used in the Bandelier Project. Unlike food resources, lithic sources on the Pajarito Plateau are
abundant, but geographically discontinuous, and may have become the focus of intense competition
as human population increased. The Bandelier Survey lithic database is examined to determine if
changes in the distribution of lithic raw materials through time can be linked to changes in settlement
patterns in order to assess the extent to which competition for lithic resources played a role in social
development within the region.

[57] ICONOGRAPHIC EXPRESSION IN THE AGRARIAN CONTEXT OF K’AXOB, BELIZE
Archaeology has increasingly shifted focus from ceremonial centers to smaller sites in the hinter-

a window to a previously silent strata of society. Comparison of the iconographic motifs of K’axob
ceramics to larger sites indicates that the world view expressed in the art of major cities was shared
by the common man. Yet K’axob was not without its own stratification, and functioning as a
microcosm of Mesoamerican political organization, the distribution of motifs within the site suggests
that particular motifs held emblematic significance for K’axob’s elites.

Recent investigations at the ancient Maya center of Pachitun, Cayo, Belize, indicate a lengthy

range of slate items recovered at Pacbitun, possible geological sources, compares Pacbitun materials
with artifacts found at Belize Valley sites, and describes a slate workshop/storage facility at the site.

Retrodiction through ethnographic analogy has always been a mainstay of archaeological interpreta-

is not unexpected since, unlike many world areas, many largely unacculturated indigenous groups
still exist in the Amazon. Ethnoarchaecology, which explicitly seeks to bridge the gap between the
present and past, is therefore especially valuable for understanding diachronic sequences of sociocultu-
ral change and more genera! human behavioral and archaeological formation processes in the region.
Past contributions and current research are reviewed and future prospects of ethnoarchacology as an
essential component of method and theory in Amazonian archaeology are discussed.

issues regarding the nature of and evidence for that interaction on a regional scale. These are: (1) the
interpretation of regional systems; (2) the role of elites and/or power relations in social interactions;
(3) interaction through production and exchange; and (4) style and exchange as different forms of
interaction, Conclusions emphasize the importance of considering multiple lines of evidence and

[11] OBSIDIAN IN TEXAS: GEOLOGIC SOURCES AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL

INTERPRETATION

For two decades, trace element analysis has been conducted of obsidian artifacts from archaeological
sites in Texas. No geologic outcrops of artifact-quality obsidian occur within the state, XRF and
NAA analyses of Texas specimens indicate that they are denved from sources in Mexico, New
Mexico, Wyoming and Idaho. Artifacts range in age from Paleoindian to Late Prehistoric. While
Paleoindian and Archaic obsidian comes from varied sources (as far away as central Mexico),distinct
patterns of obsidian distribution are seen in Late Prehistoric times. Particularly significant is the
presence of Malad (Idaho) obsidian linked to Great Plains trade networks.

Agricultural oases appear in the deserts of Central Asia at the end of the third millennium BC.
The Margiana oasis, one of the earliest occupied, was colonized from urban states 200 km to the

ideological symbols and political organization appear to be similar between the two areas, but oasis
settlements are dispersed over the broad deltaic alluvium, The earliest oasis settlements are typically

Investigations at the Nochta site have revealed extensive deposits of Early and Middle Archaic

intensity between the two components are indicated by greater density and diversity of features for
the Middle Archaic. It is believed that the pattern observed at the Nochta site is reflective of a

‘ fundamental shift in settlement systems from the Early to Middle Archaic toward increasing seden-
tism. The maturation of the floodplain, with concomitant localization of food resources in slack-
water environments is seen as a major influence affecting change.

TEMPERED PREHISTORIC POTTERY REPLICATES
Limestone temper is common in Late Woodland pottery from east and central Missouri and Emer-
gent Mississippian pottery from the American Bottom of western Illinois. Limestone temper makes
sticky clay more workable, bur also causes pots to spall if fired over 600° C, a low pottery firing
temperature. A strength test of ceramic bars that replicate prehistoric pottery tempered with crushed
granite, grog, or limestone demonstrates that of the three temper types, limestone-tempered pottery
is significantly stronger when fired at 600° C. This suggests the inclusion of limestone was a technologi-
cal shift, one that required refinement of pottery manufacture techniques to prevent spalling.

[113] PALEOINDIAN AGGREGATIONS ON THE GREAT PLAINS: WHY, HOW, WHEN, AND

Flexibility in hunter-gatherer group composition and periodic aggregation is common. Ethnographic
cases and standard archaeological interpretations provide only limited examples of how the social
and economic purposes of aggregations might be fulfilled. Archaeological evidence for the occurrence,
location, and nature of aggregations remains ambiguous, with diverse interpretations offered for
aggregation sites during Folsom times. These are reconsdidered in light of a model incorporating
temporally extended and spatially dispersed aggregations as part of a large scale and longterm landuse
pattern. The model implications suggest needed revisions to some Paleoindian site investigations.

Hypotheses that translocation of LaCrosse populations to southeast Minnesota and northeast lowa
during this period resulted from partial or complete failure of crops due to climatic change are not
supported by floral data. Recent analysis of plant remains from the Filler site (47-LC-149), the latest

alternative hypotheses, such as emphasizing bison hunting or impact of epidemics, should be tested
more thoroughly.

approach for reconstructing how rock piles and associated field houses functioned at a Classic period

[104] SOCIAL CONTEXTS FOR EARLY POTTERY IN THE CENTRAL AMERICAN ISTHMUS

The Central American isthmus has long been recognized as an important bridge between culture
areas to the north and south. However, the significant range of variation in form and decoration
expressed in the earliest known ceramic complexes from Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and Panama suggests
that the appearance of pottery is not readily explained by the diffusion of subsistence strategies
or the expansion of horticultural populations. Regional manifestations instead suggest divergent
trajectories of culture change. Social interaction is suggested as the principal factor in the emergence
of carly ceramic traditions.

[53] MULTIPLE VOICES IN MAYA WRITING: EVIDENCE FOR FIRST- AND SECOND-
PERSON REFERENCES

As exalted accounts of the Maya elite, glyphic intkcriptions are thought by many to record only
the most impersonal, third-person statements. Recent decipherments document a far broader range
of “voices,” ranging from direct quotations in the first person to directed remarks in the second.

This paper reports on the evidence for such unusual pronominal usage and yanoer the existence

of narratives with shifting speakers and multiple points of view. Unique in PreColambian writing,

this flexibility underscores the extraordinary ability of Maya script to record linguistic nuance.

[66] A RECONSIDERATION OF THE TRILOBAL ELEMENT IN MESOAMERICA: DATA
SURVEY, CONTINUING INTERPRETATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE
RESEARCH

New information is presented on the iconographic sign previously labeled the trilobal element. It
is proposed rhat one manifestation signifies rain and/or water. Another manifestation represents
blood. Since it can represent either water, rain or blood, separate labels are suggested, It 1s demonstrated
that the three signs existed from the Formative period to Colonial times and may continue to
survive among certain present day Maya groups. The significance of this continuity appears to be
the importance and interconnectedness of water/rain and blood to the animistic pre-Hispanic peoples.

[26] THE ARCHITECTURAL EXPRESSION OF PREHISTORIC PUEBLOAN SOCIAL

COMPLEXITY IN THE UPLAND SOUTHWEST
Architectural and social complexity are closely linked. As compared with nonelite households,
elite residential architecture tends to demonstrate greater labor investment, especially in aspects
symbolizing status and social meaning. 13th century Mesa Verde Pueblo architectural complexes in
southwestern Colorado were compared to determine if there was evidence of elite households, Varia-
tion in relative construction effort, masonry selection and uniformity and shaping of stones suggests

a moderate level of social or functional differentiation among residential units, but the presence of

a residential elite is not supported.

An ethnoarchaeological study among the Aka, a modern foraging group, provides opportunities to
follow the impacts of various types of cultural behavior on the zooarchaeological remains deposited
at a forager residential camp. Patterning resulting from hunting strategies, meat sharing, meat tradc,

WILLIAMSON SITE, HUNTERDON COUNTY, NEW JERSEY
The Early Woodland component at the Williamson site was found in a sealed, deeply buried

Models of adaptive replacement for hunter-gatherer groups in the Great Basin proposed by Bettinger

use of higher ranked resources by the travellers and less residential mobility and greater use of lower
ranked resources by the processors. Preliminary results of archacological research at hunter-gatherer

The ’‘O’ factor in the soil formational model s = f{cl, 0,7, p, t ... ) refers to organisms, which
traditionally has meantonly plants and their biochemical effects, In reality there are five kingdoms
of life, or four others besides plants. The five lifeforms collectively affect soil biochemically and
biomechanically, as Darwin and his contemporaries noted but others forgot. Inasmuch as soil is the
usual medium in which archaeologists dig, it is imperative to appreciate the general roles of both
processes in archaeological stratigraphy and site evolution. ‘Dynamic denudation’ is a Gaian approach

to explaining site evolution that showcases these and other key soil-slope processes.

Many misconceptions have resulted in the last two decades regarding Cahokia and its relationship
to other societies. Within the last three years two major publications (Stoltman, and Emerson and

We describe and attempt to explain these processes from the perspective of a long-term survey and

revising a model for aggregation in which subsistence intensification, driven by increasing population,
forces increased agricultural specialization and provides selective advantages for larger villages in

FROM AGIOS VASILIOS
The study of Byzantine sites in the Aegean is not commensurate with the historical importance
of this period, One effort to redress this oversight by Ohio State University researchers has involved ;
theodolite survey, geophysical prospection, and GIS analysis of the fortified site of Agios Vasilios,
which lies in a strategic location in the Korinthia of eastern Greece. This study is part of a larger
research program that intends to examine systematically settlement systems in the region. Investiga-
tion of the Agios Vasilios site adds important data on the size and configuration of secondary centers
in the Medieval Korinthia. ‘

[39] HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTS AND EARLY AGRICULTURE IN CENTRAL THAILAND
In order to lay the foundation for studying the origins of rice agriculture in Thailand, a regional
paleoenvironmental study was recently initiated in central Thailand. The project sampled from .
modern, geological, and archacological soil sequences for both phytolith and pollen analysis. A series
of four Holocene sequences have been analyzed and dated, providing a history of Holocene human ;
impact on vegetation in this area. The identification of rice phytoliths, and a broad range of eco-
specific phytolith forms, suggest that a larger scale project could potentially address many issues in
discussions of agricultural origins in Southeast Asia,

[61] PHYTOLITHS IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN FLORA
As part of an investigation of the development of agriculture in Thailand, 360 species from over
80 families of southeast Asian plants or domesticates were analyzed for phytoliths. The distribution
: of phytoliths by species, genus, and family is presented. Previously unreported diagnostic phytoliths
are also shown. These results provide one facet of the necessary background for paleoenvironmenta!
reconstruction. In conjunction with the analysis of modern and paleo soils, changing patterns of
agricultural, and other economic, activities in the region can be studied. Preliminary soil analysis
results from central Thailand provide a larger context for compiling a phytolith type collection.

[16] MONUMENTALITY

Monumentality marks several of the sites discussed in this symposium, we ask what monumental-
ity implies: a sign of states? or are there other explanations for the creation of monumental structures?
Childe listed monumentality in his criteria for cities because it implied capital wealth from taxes
or tribute, and (engineering) science. Amos Rapoport says traditional capitals were charismatic ‘'the-
aters of power,” “the center of centers,” redundantly the center for authority, transport, trade, arts,
and religion. Monumentality communicates the multiply reinforced centrality of the traditional
capital. May we infer a site was politically important if it lacks monumental structures?

[29] INTERPRETING SITE CLUSTERS: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE MAINE COAST

Prehistoric shell middens along the central Maine coast occur in dense clusters where convoluted
shores provide access to a wide range of resources. Productivity limits of adjacent tidal flats are often
invoked as the reason for frequent movements by prehistoric groups, Shell midden density is, thus,
due to settlement “noise’’, An alternative interpretation takes the shell midden clusters as the unit
of analysis. Discrete shell middens, then, are not individual sites, but segments of dispersed coastal
communities focused on the bays and coves around which they occur. Archaeological interpretation
of shell midden clusters requires redefinition of the ‘‘site”’ concept.

176] A QUESTION OF SCALE: HOUSEHOLD, COMMUNITY, AND
ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN MESOAMERICA
Recent approaches to the archaeological record of complex societies, particularly in Mesoamerica,
have focused on the household, This is an important sociological scale and one implemented in
geography, agriculural economy. and settlement archacology. Ethnoarchaeological research, however,
suggests that the application of household-level models cannot stand alone and their usefulness for
commonly recovered types of survey and excavation data may be questioned. This paper examines
characteristics of the material record at the settlement level of analysis and the implications of this
scale for understanding temporal and spatial aspects of the development of communities. Examples
are drawn from recent ethnoarchaeological research in lowland and highland Mesoamerica.

displaying individual wealth and inequality in the emergence of elites in China. Pigs were the funds
of tactical power which were used to control exotic sumptuary items in order to achieve political
power in China. Archacological data strongly suggest that, over the long-term, the fluctuation of pig
skulls in burials coincides with that of prestige goods from long-distance trade. In short, the paper
shows that the control of pigs must have functioned as both an internal and external source of power
to legitimate political authority and respect in ancient China.

[5] A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE FOR INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE AT COLHA, BELIZE
In 1987 the Colha Project discovered suspiciously rectilinear “islands” at the edge of Cobweb
Swamp, next to an area of Late Classic occupation. Excavations in these features, in the adjacent
terrain, and in nearby mounds strongly suggested that they represented ancient raised fields, worked
by the households closest to them. Since then, extensive work by soil and pollen specialists has
considerably enhanced our picture of the ancient Colha environment. While the existence of fields
has been affirmed, the different lines of evidence have raised intriguing questions about Maya methods
of intensive farming. This paper will attempt to reconcile the sometimes conflicting data and suggest
differing interpretations for future testing.

An observation made repeatedly in studies of inter- and intra-settlement spatial organization is
that structure or organization becomes increasingly complex as the use of an area increases in

Using data from two studies of modern households, measures of spatial organization are developed
from thermodynamic principles. Changing household population density, suggested to be measure
of intensity, is then seen to produce patterned variation that is typical of nonlinear or “living”
thermodynamic systems. The paper closes with a discussion of the perspective's implications for
archaeological inquiry.

[73] CURRENT PERSPECTIVES IN THE EVOLUTION OF HUMAN ADAPTATIONS IN
SOUTHERN SOUTH AMERICA

Between 1930 and 1970, the archaeology of the southern cone of America was overshadowed by
the work of Junius Bird, During the last 20 years, the Pampa-Patagonia region has witnessed an
important growth in the number of archaeological investigations. As a consequence, there are now
multiple competing perspectives on the evolution of human adaptation. This paper presents a sum-
mary of these competing views and discusses the distinct notion of evolution employed in this
recondite tip of America.

[93] IDENTIFYING SEASONALITY IN COASTAL SUBSISTENCE SYSTEMS ON THE PACIFIC
COAST OF PREHISTORIC CENTRAL AMERICA

There has been little emphasis on the seasonal aspects of coastal populations in prehistoric Central
America. Coastal systems are components of broader regional systems, in which exchange systems
develop and/or seasonal transhumance occurs. The ability to identify seasonality in coastal settle-
ments and the exploitation of coastal resources is critical for models of prehistoric adaptation.
Published excavation data on prehistoric Pacific coastal settlement and subsistence systems will be
reviewed for the degree of analysis of systemic and seasonal data. Combined with broader comparative
data, suggestions will be made on how future studies might successfully address the seasonality
issue,

[38] ETHOLOGICAL INFORMATION IN THE ANIMAL REPRESENTATIONS OF LASCAUX

The hundreds of complex animal representations and scores of multi-animal compositions at
Lascaux entice ethological analysis. The Lascaux animals are uncannily complete anatomically but
stylized toward incorrectness. Three ethological indicators, ear position, tail position, and footfall
are examined at Lascaux and other caves in Perigord and Quercy. Ethological information on individual
animals abounds in wall imagery throughout the region, but group behavior is less evident. While
often described as galloping or leaping, few Lascaux animals show footfalls tor more than canter.
Lascaux provides poor evidence for any general model of artistic intentions regarding ethology.

The gargi (ceremonial house} of Northern Coastal Alaska organized communities both socially
and spatially, but its role changed during various stages of economic and religious contact with
Euroamericans. Qargi structures were systematically dismantled or had their uses altered in coastal
villages between Cape Prince of Wales and Barrow, Alaska, but in many of these communities the
institution of the qargi remained an important organizational force long after the permanent structures
were gone. Through the use of archaeological, archival, and oral historical data, this paper addresses
how changes in the use of the garg) are reflected in the archaeological record.

This paper considers recent research on the post-1150 Southwest from the perspective of large-scale

earlier regional systems persisted through the 13th century, but relocations in the 13th-14th centuries
shattered a centuries-old regional ecology. The Puebloan world of the 15th and early 16th centuries
continued this new trajectory, later interrupted by colonial intrusions.

Developments in the automatic data acquisition, storage, retrieval, analysis and display of archaco-
logical data, particularly complex landscape characteristics, are fundamentally altering the way in
which the record of the past should be recorded and can be understood. Specific techniques that are
merging in a synergistic way include geographic information systems, multi-spectral digital imagery,
global positioning systems, high resolution location recorders, visualization software and robust
statistical systems for large, spatial datasets. This paper will review the background to the develop-
ment of these closely linked systems over the last twenty five years, their previous application to
archaeological revelant problems and the future implications of such approaches to archaeological
analysis. Attention will be placed on both the technical factors and institutional responses needed
to meet the challenges of change.

[16] WAS CHICHEN ITZA LIKE ROME?

George Kubler once wrote that ‘Chichen Itza is like Rome, restating whole traditions in Mesoameri-
can art.” Ever since Sylvanus G. Morley suggested that Chichen was the capital of the Mayan “New
Empire”, scholars have assumed that Chichen Itza, like Rome, was the capital of an empire-variously
called Toltec, Putun, or Itza. A hard look at the latest evidence regarding northern Yucatecan architec-
ture and settlement patterns, however, does not yield any hint that Chichen Itza dominated a territory
any greater than other major Maya sites such as Cobs, Izamal, or even Tikal. Problems of definition
can be better refined now, for instance: what do we mean by “dominate?” The terms “Itza” and
"Toltec” in particular probably convey more information about ideological and religious than political
or economic unity within northern Yucatan. Chichen Itza might, then, best be compared to the
Rome of the Papal States era-one of many competing political powers in a crowded landscape.

had a very high population density during Emergent Mississippian times, consisting of numerous
small nucleated settlements scattered along virtually every alluvial ridge in the area. The results of

infrastructure of roads, administrative settlements, forts, and sacred places; demographic and ethnic
reorganization; variations in state/subject economic and political relations; exploitation of natural
resources; frontier relations, and effects on indigenous populations. These studies show that imperial
rule in the south, although smaller scale than in the central Andes, was more intensive than is

Conclusions suggest that the patterns recovered from the two-tiered societies of Old Hoover and

versely, the three-tiered settlement systems of Lake George and Moundville yielded archaeological

“patterns reflective of status ranking. Population size and density, dietary dependence on maize, and

[47] INFERENCES ABOUT CERAMICS AND PEOPLE IN SOUTHEAST MISSOURI:
PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF COMPOSITIONAL ANALYSIS

More than a decade of archaeological study of the Current River drainage in southeast Missouri
has generated several questions about movements of people and goods, and interaction between late
prehistoric groups in this region. Efforts to answer these questions have included integration of
neutron activation analysis into the long-term research design. Samples of residual and alluvial clays
are collected to serve as a reference for identifying the origin of Woodland, Emergent Mississippian,
and Powers phase ceramics. Archacological ceramics are selected from existing collections to answer
specific inter- and intra-site questions. Results of the first 200 samples are discussed.

[28] HOLOCENE ALLUVIAL CYCLES AND EARLY AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENTS IN ARID
LANDS; A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST AND THE
SOUTHERN LEVANT

Archaeological and radiocarbon dating of Holocene alluvial deposits in the American Southwest
and the Southern Levant allow reconstruction of the sequences of major deposition and erosion cycles
over the last 11,000 years. These alluvial sequences are sensitive records of environmental changes
that profoundly affected potentials for prehistoric agriculture and sedentary settlement. Comparisons
between these regions indicate similar correlations between climatic and human land-use changes,
alluvial responses, and adjustments in subsistence-settlement strategies. This comparative approach,
considering information from both previous and recent field studies, leads to new interpretations of
the development, diffusion, and stability of early agricultural settlements in arid lands.

[64] IRON AGE AND RECENT SETTLEMENT PATTERNING IN NORTHERN CAMEROON

Archaeological and ethnohistorical investigations by the Mandara Archaeological Project/Project

Maya-Wandala in 1984, 1986 and 1992 indicate that significant differences exist between the settle-

ment patterns of later Iron Age (AD 1000-1600) and recent Wandala populations living on the plains

north of the Mandara Mountains, In this paper, | will examine these differences and relate them to

a general model of change in montagnard/plains-dweller interaction over the same period. I will also

discuss the applicability of this model to other mountain-plains boundary zones in West Africa.

During the last 25 years north coast archacology has made major advances in some areas. For
example, little progress was made in refining ceramic chronologies, but major advances were made
in research related to the rise and development of the state. Concurrent with the latter investigations
were studies of the technology necessary for the intensification of agricultural production.

To date, skeletal biologists have contributed little to testing hypotheses relating to increasing

provides the opportunity to directly examine the health consequences associated with emerging
complexity. Morbidity patterns reflected by skeletal pathologies indicate that nutritional stress was

a significant community health problem. The prevalence of pathologies indicative of infectious

40LA92 is located at the southern terminus of the First Chickasaw Bluff, approximately 5 km
north of the mouth of the Hatchie River. Although sparse evidence of Woodland occupations is
present, the site essentially represents a single component Late Mississippian village inhabited for
roughly 150 years. Investigations at the site included a complete controlled surface collection and
test excavations at selected localities. Six radiocarbon determinations place occupation of the site
between A.D. 1420 and 1550, and provide the tightest temporal control for a Late Mississippian
assemblage in the Central Mississippi Valley.

The skeletal remains of 67 individuals, 22 subadults and 45 adults, from tombs dating approximately
3400-3800 BP are considered. One tomb dated about 3400 BP includes 27 individuals. The remaining
40 are distributed in 8 tombs dated about 3700-3800 BP. Estimated life expectancy and stature are
less in the more recent sample, suggesting perhaps adverse cffects of nutritional and disease conditions.
A variety of pathological conditions are present; perhaps the most significant involve the thoracolum-

During a 1992 survey of several high altitude (9,000—10,000 ft, ams!) valleys within the Manti-
LaSal National Forest, numerous lithic surface scatters were recorded, ranging from isolated finds
to extensive scatters covering ten hectares or more, Pr the wide variation in size and density,
all of the scatters appear to represent the Early to Middle Archaic Periods. Several alternative explana-

Period peoples were so heavily represented at these upland canyon sites, while earlier and later groups
appear to be underrepresented.

[43] RECOGNITION OF THE DEFOREST FORMATION IN THE MIDWEST U.S.A.:

IMPLICATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Recent investigations of Holocene alluvial stratigraphy and chronology in the Midwest documented
the presence of the DeForest Formation, a lithostratigraphic unit encompassing all Holocene Alluvium.
The formation is subdivided into four members: Camp Creek, Roberts Creek, Gunder, and Corrington.
The members of the DeForest Formation have a systematic distribytion within drainage networks
and are mappable. Therefore, recognition of the DeForest Formation in the region has important
implications for locating buried cultural materials and explaining apparent gaps in the archaeological
record. Once the distribution of the formation’s members is defined for an area, potentials for buried
archaeological deposits dating to certain cultural periods can be determined. Hence, the DeForest
Formation provides a stratigraphic framework for locating the buried archaeological record in a large
portion of the Midwest.

diversity of approaches for interpreting material patterning.
|8] PALEONUTRITION: SELECTED PAPERS ON THE DIET AND HEALTH OF PREHISTORIC
AMERICANS

Rapid recent advances in paleonutrition research threaten to fragment this already diverse field
into a variety of vital, but disjoint subdisciplines. Yet archaeological inference relies heavily on such
evidence. This symposium presents recent research that has focussed on defining paleonutrition as
a discipline and how researchers have used such studies in advancing our knowledge of the diet,
health, and nutrition of prehistoric Americans, The research provides examples of how integrative
work is necessary to determine paleonutrition, and the problems inherent in such analyses.
[9] THE CENTRALITY OF BIOARCHAEOLOGY: ANDEAN INSTANCES

We present Andean case studies that illustrate the centrality of bioarchacology. Ecologically framed
studies of adaptation are validated by investigation of paleodemography and skeletal and dental
indicators of diet and stress. Example studies present hypotheses concerning trade, tribute, pilgrimage,
warfare, and the limits of contemporaneous occupations. Analyses of the skeleto-muscular system
substantiate posited differences in activities and diet between sexes, time periods, and social classes
or ethnic groups. To ignore bioarchaeological interpretation would be to imperil the intellectual
promise of archaeological study. Andean studies present a model to be followed.
[16] COMPARING CAPITALS

The great capitals of pre-Columbian America seem to be literally mind-boggling to many archaeolo-
gists. Both Tiwanaku and Cahokia, for examples, have been described respectively as “pilgrimage
shrine” and “low-level chiefdom,” as if their stupendous dominance could not be seen. To amend
such bias, we compare a series of American capitals in the light of recent research, both empirical
and interpretive. The concept of “capital” involves questions of identifying polities, their probable
political economies, trade systems, and ideologies - and the fundamental question of what constitutes
warranted inference in archacology.

« Consultants Inc. are involved in all phases of this work. This symposium provides the vehicle

for the presentation of this research which spans the Early Archaic through the Lare Woodland.
Contributions include new insights into the use and procurement of lithic materials,a much clearer

[18] THE PRE-CLOVIS PROOF FROM PENDEJO CAVE, OROGRANDE, NEW MEXICO

This careful excavation of the beautifully stratified, well-dated zones of Pendejo Cave, Near Oro-

Further, 40 or more radio-carbon determinations from 20 sequential strata from 12,900 to more than
38,100 years (maybe 50,000 BP) indicate these remains are well before Clovis times. The evidence
for this besides crude tools (often made from lithics foreign to cave) are manmade hearths, bones
worked by man, human hair, human palm and fingerprints, as well as non-random concentrations
of ecofacts and artifacts. The participants of the symposium shall give details of each of the above-
mentioned proofs and will be available to discuss such with one and all.

While the importance of ties between coastal and highland populations has long been recognized,
connections to peoples and resources east of the Andes have often been downplayed or ignored.
Archaeological and ethnobotanical evidence indicates a long history of contact between the sierra
and the eastern lowlands, yet the significance of this relationship to the cultural trajectories of
societies in both regions has rarely been discussed. This symposium provides a forum for discussion
of recent archaeological and ethnohistoric investigations into the nature of highland-lowland interac-

perspectives and specific case studies from the Old and New World, from the origins of agriculture
to complex states, are included.

new data and the emerging understandings from the Late Archaic onward.

Recent changes in federal and state laws and regulations have led to an exponential increase in
the need for consultations with Native American and other traditional communities about identifica-
tion and protection of historic properties, disposition of human burials removed from areas impacted
by development, and other issues. Because these new consultations are additions to the existing
CRM structure, archaeologists in state and federal agencies and in private practice are often the only
anthropologists available to meet these requirements. In this symposium, archaeologists and Native
Americans discuss the issues and challenges of this expanding consultation process.

of the appearance and development of image-making among many late Pleistocene peoples - there
is no one “Paleolithic Art”. The symposium will address a more general questions of why some
peoples engage with and elaborate material culture and aft making, and what is the archaeological
evidence for the reasons and contexts in which this happens.

The symposium will be addressing the approaches, methodologies and processes that are involved
in surveying, recording and preserving archaeological sites and monuments in England.

The mid-third millennium BC witnesses the development of complex ‘chiefdom’ societies on the
Greek mainland, in the Cycladic islands, and on Crete. However, this period then comes to an abrupt
end in archaeological terms, marked by dislocation across the Aegean: especially on the mainland
where sites are destroyed and a new material culture appears, and in the Cyclades, where new cultural
traits occur and the previous civilization vanishes. This paper examines the social context in which
such change occurred, the chronology of events, climatic and geomorphological associations, sug-

Ancestral interments within the core of a residence represent a means of reckoning genealogy,

deposits of K’axob. Stratigraphic and burial data from three seasons of excavation are presented in
order to demonstrate the crucial and determinative role of ancestral interments in the transformation
of K’axob from a nucleated Middle Formative village to a Late Classic dispersed community.

ral mechanism for this transformation served as the basis for a model that was tentatively validated
by the discovery of a protokiva at the HO Bar site, a terminal Archaic to initial Mogollon pithouse
village. Religious ritual satiated organizational requisites during the initial aggregation of multiple
societies within the Mogollon culture area. Nonrandom village layout patterns that include a commu-
nal structure as a spatial focus are the archaeological reflection of these processes.

[86] LEGISLATING THE DEAD: NEGOTIATION AND ao NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES
PROTECTION AND REPATRIATION ACT (NAGPRA)

NAGPRA represents the culmination of a lengthy legislative process mediating the diverse interests
of museums, scientists, and Native Americans regarding the proper treatment of human remains
and certain cultural items. This paper uses the legislative history of the statute to highlight the major
disputed issues, including the type of items covered, criteria for determining right of possession,
identification of groups eligible to make claims, applicability, and implementing procedures. Many
of the major issues raised during the legislative process were effectively resolved with the statute's
passage. Other issues require clarification through the ongoing regulation process, while others may
be resolved in the courts. )

(93] PREHISTORIC COASTAL MAYA USE OF NATIVE PALMS,

The use and significance of native palms by the ancient coastal Maya is evaluated. The identification
and quantification of palm nuts from Maya sites in south coastal Belize (A.D. 300-1400) provides a
rare glimpse of coastal Maya diet, with remains preserved due to anacorobic soil. Comparative
and ethnobiological data support the view that tree-cropping, especially native palms, was a viable
subsistence strategy for the coastal Maya on offshore islands where land was limited.

{9] THE INCREASING ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF WOMEN IN PRECERAMIC PERU

This paper will specifically address changes in social relations as inferred by the imbalanced division
of labor and women’s increasing economic and implicit social value. Skeletal evidence from the
preceramic site of Paloma, located on coastal Peru, demonstrates that over time, gender-specific
activities increased. In the early occupation levels, men and women were involved in similar undertak-
ings. By the final occupation period, however, men and women were engaged in different types of
subsistence tasks, The reasons for these changes in men’s and women’s work may be linked to the
transition from hunting and gathering to sedentism based on a maritime economy.

BIFACE MORPHOLOGY

Typological analysis of Acheulian biface variability is based on measurement ratios which describe
shape. Ratios remove any consideration of size from biface type assignments. Biface size is considered
incidental. This approach has not contributed to an explanation of biface variability. It can be shown
that the shape ratios themselves are directly related to bitace size. Factors which effect size, such as
local raw materials and intensity of utilization, explain much of the variability measured with biface
typologies.

[61] THE USE OF OPOL PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS IN PALEOECOLOGICAL
RECONSTRUCTION ON ST. CATHERINE’S ISLAND, GEORGIA
Opal phytolith analysis offers unique opportunities for detailed microecological reconstruction. A
drawback to regional ecological reconstruction is that many samples over a wide area are required.
To achieve this a quick and inexpensive means of collecting samples has been developed. In an
ongoing project on St. Catherine’s Island, Georgia, soil samples have been collected along several
transects intersecting several archaeological features using a hand operated coring tool. Analysis of
these samples has enabled a fairly fine grained reconstruction of both archaeological and ecological
features, including the identification of an ambiguous geological feature as anthropogenic and the
identification of cultivated areas.

PULLTROUSER SWAMP, BELIZE
Charred botanical remains and mollusks recovered by flotation at Pulltrouser Swamp (in 1979 and
1981) provide ample evidence for changing agricultural patterns. The available data suggest a system
of long-fallow upland farming, coupled with door-yard orchard/garden horticulture, began in the early
Middle Preclassic. By the Late Preclassic, fallow periods were shortened and a system of intensive
channelized field production was adopted. Evidence from both settlement and field contexts is consis-
tent with the hypothesis that Late Classic Maya farmers maximized production by combining short-
fallow milpa, dooryard garden, and island field systems. Multiple lines of evidence are necessary to
understand these complex and variable, relict agricultural features.

Recent work highlights significant differences of opinion about Cahokia and its satellite communi-

ing collections from several hundred Illinois and Missouri sites in floodplain and upland settings
provide a fresh perspective on the occupational histories and disposition of major and minor settle-
ments, as well as the geographical distribution of sites with assemblages closely approximating
those of Cahokia. Interpretations of these data differ sharply from conventional wisdom—they are
consistent with a more modest sociopolitical system than the standard view of a heavily populated,
stable, and mighty Cahokia that dominated far-flung peoples.

pottery was used as tableware, for storage of foodstuffs, for cooking, and for holding water. The
adoption of pottery for cooking had a significant impact on diet and on contemporary cuisine. In

[111] MIDDLE AND UPPER PALEOLITHIC RESEARCH AT DENISOVA CAVE, THE ALTAI,

RUSSIA

Denisova Cave, situated in the Anuy River Basin, the Altai, northern Asia, is a large cave containing
a long sequence of Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic cultural and faunal material. A multi-phase,
joint Russian-American interdisciplinary research program was initiated at the site during the summer
of 1992. This paper summarizes prior research at Denisova Cave, preliminary results obtained during
the 1992 field season, and future research strategies regarding issues of chronostratigraphy, paleoecolog-
ical reconstruction, site formation processes, and the nature of the Middle to Upper Paleolithic
transition at the site and its relation to other corresponding regional sequences.

[100] IS IT, OR ISN’T IT? DISTINGUISHING PREHISTORIC FROM RECENT WATER AND

SOIL CONTROL FEATURES IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST

Rock alignments, variously known as check dams, linear borders, terraces, and trincheras, con-
structed for the control of water flow and its effects on the distribution and displacement of soils
have been found throughout the American Southwest. While the probable functions of such features
can be determined with little difficulty, the resolution of their antiquity has been much more
problematical. Recently constructed rock alignments can be, and have been, easily confused for
prehistoric features. This paper identifies 13 morphological characteristics of such alignments that,
when no other chronometric evidence is available, may be used to distinguish prehistoric from
recently constructed features.

[80] STONE TOOL DIVERSITY IN IROQUOIAN STUDIES: ARE WE MISSING SOMETHING
HERE?

Recent analysis of stone tool diversity at the Late Prehistonc Ripley Site in southwestern New
York indicates an unusually restricted range of activities at this site. But an attempt to expand the
diversity analysis to other comparable lithic assemblages reveals a surprising lack of quantification
in Iroquoian studies that made meaningful comparison impossible. The examination of published
reports for Iroquois and related Late Prehistoric sites demonstrates a general lack of concern for lithic
studies as a source of information about past behavior. There is a demonstrable need for more
intensive studies of Iroquois technologies other than ceramics.

[80] UNDERSTANDING SITE FUNCTION AT THE RIPLEY SITE

Late prehistoric earthworks in southwestern New York have been assumed to represent defensive
fortifications. However, reexamination of older data and newly collected information from the Ripley
Site, an carth ring site situated on the bluffs above Lake Erie, suggests that the site 1s not a simple
fortified village and cemetery complex as has been assumed in the literature. It now seems likely
that this site had a more complex occupational history possibly involving mortuary ntual. This
tentative conclusion leads us to call for a general reevaluation of earthwork sites, settlement patterns
and methods of discerning site function.

[56] SORTING OUT SOURCES OF VARIABILITY IN SETTLEMENT LOCATIONS: A CASE
STUDY AMONG PASTORALISTS IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL ANDES

Locational decisions involve compromises among diverse and often contradictory demands. Limita-
tions of “adaptationist” views, that consider almost exclusively ecological factors, are evident in the
common failure of optimization models based on enyironmenta! data to predict sertlement location.
This paper argues that considering social and ideological variables can improve significantly our
anderstanding of the use of space by human societies. This point is illustrated with ethnoarchacolog}-
cal data from a community of herders and caravan traders in the South-Central Andes. Using GIS
technology, a variety of factors that influence the location of residential activities and associated
features are explored.

MANGOTE, PANAMA

Cerro Mangote is a large, preceramic shel! midden and burial site along the Pacific coast of central
Panama. The midden (5000-3000BC} contains faunal remains, chipped and ground stone artifacts, |
shell artifacts, and 85 human burials. The 815N and 813C in bone collagen and 613C in bone carbonate
suggest a more terrestrially-based high-carbohydrate diet than expected from the site location and
midden contents (8ISN = +7.5 + .5%-, n=13, 613C coll = —13.6 + 6%", n= 14; 813C carb =
~4,5 + 8%; n=12). These results are consistent with intermittent or seasonal exploitation of
coastal resources by a transhumant forager/horticultural population.

Late Mississippian sites in Pemiscot County, Missouri are well known in the archaeological litera-

Unfortunately, archaeological emphasis has focused on pigeon-holing the remains into phases, the
result of which has been a proliferation of spatial-temporal constructs that ignore variation in artifacts
among the sites. When Brainerd-Robinson and multidimensional scaling are used to examine similarit-

[32] FROM RECORD TO CONSERVATION—A REGIONAL PERSPECTIVE
The great majority of archaeological features at a regional and local level are unprotected except
insofar as they fall within the planning system, and many landscapes which depend upon traditional
land management are now under threat because of changing agricultural patterns, Constraint control
and policy advice at regional and county levels needs ready access to archaeological information so
that the potential effects of the increasing pressures of development and change may be assessed and
then mitigated, adequate mechanisms for the regular monitoring of the consequences of such changes
are also necessary. Archaeological survey together with aerial photography provides an efficient and
cost-effective means of creating an adequate database for the formulation of appropriate management
policies. Modem interactive computer systems enable the convenient analysis of such information,
so that the results may be conveyed to, and utilized by, policy makers in a readily assimilable form.
The transition from mapping to management is gathering considerable momentum and presents a
major challenge to regional and local archaeologists.

Researchers consider the carved ballplayers at Dainzu to be thematically distinct trom the iconogra-

was part of a ritual sequence fundamental to political and religious ideology. This ritual pattern
included warfare and captive sacrifice, Structural comparison of the Dainzu ballplayers with contempo-
rary materials at Monte Alban and other cultural regions of Mesoamerica reveals that the Dainzu
program was an expression of legitimization by a competing local polity. Iconographic evidence of

Early eighteenth century Navajo visits to Black Mesa in Northeastern Arizona were sporadic and
short. In the next three centuries, however, Navajo land use patterns in this region changed dramati-

tural features as Navajo families came to depend upon the natural resources of Black Mesa for more
and more of their subsistence. This paper looks at these changes from the perspective of cultural
evolution by focusing on the adaptive responses made by Navajo families to specific circumstances
created by environmental and social agents.

the period between 400 BC and AD 500 by peoples belonging to the Tumaco-La Tolita tradition.
During this time period, subsistence activities were focused on the extensive mangrove/estuary
systems of the region. Later prehistoric groups did not utilize estuarine resources to any great extent,

households at the Cahokia site proper. Significant changes in exotic-good assemblages from seriated .
deposits at Tract 15A correspond to community restructuring and illustrate that an abrupt and large-
scale political transformation occurred in the region. This change is coterminous with or followed
by the adoption of certain Mississippian elements. ““Mississippianization” may be a manifestation
of the symbolic and economic means whereby Cahokia rulers attempted to reproduce regional consoli-

To date, evidence of Arctic Small Tool tradition (ASTt) use of the southwest Anderson Plain, an
area east of Inuvik, N.W.T., has been found at four localities. While to the cast, in the District of
Keewatin, a dependence upon caribou led to a southern shift in Pre-Dorset range into the barrenlands
about 3500 years ago, data from the Anderson Plain region suggest the maintenance of a coastal-
inland seasonal round. Available radiocarbon dates for two of the Anderson Plain sites are roughly
contemporaneous with the barrenland movement; 3390+ 255 (S-3000) and 3470+ 430 (S-3377) B.P.
Assessment of the artifacts found at the Anderson Plain ASTt sites suggests closer links with the

resources. The various subsistence-settlement models proposed will be discussed and contrasted with

presence ca. 2500 B.C. Intensive cultivation, especially of corn, dates to 1000-1400 B.C., with the
construction of drainage ditches occurring slightly later in the Preclassic period. The wetland fields
were largely abandoned in the Classic period, The ees raised appearance of the fields is a natural
phenomenon related to colluviation and a rise in the water table.

{14] ANTLER AS A RAW MATERIAL: EXPERIMENTATION WITH REPLICATED LOWER
MAGDALENIAN SPEARPOINTS
While archaeologists have long analyzed the artistidand typological aspects of Magdalenian antler
implements, relatively little effort has been expended upon learning their functional aspects. In order
to better understand the applications of antler as a raw material as well as the durability and potential
use-life of spearpoints made from it, the author hafted and threw 20 replicated Lower Magdalenian
spearpoints at a dead animal target until breakage was induced. The results indicatelthe incredible
durability of antler projectile points and their long use-life, far beyond what one would expect from
a stone point. 5

[110] TRADE, TOOLS, AND TASKS: THE CHIPPED STONE INDUSTRY FROM AN URUK
TOWN
The fourth millennium B.C. is characterized by an apparent increase in interregional interaction
between resource-poor alluvial Mesopotamia and surrounding resource-rich zones. Although pre-
sumed to be related to growing trade, few detailed interregional studies of the movement of goods
have been undertaken. Using data from the Uruk Mound, Abu Salabikh (Iraq) and sites in southwestern

specific hypotheses which are being used to elucidate this process, the archaeological implications
of these arguments, and the specific nature of technological change. Discussions will focus on the
Mesolithic of Western Europe, and the Paleoindian/Archaic of North America. In doing so, they will
provide a review of how Old and New World archacologists are dealing with these difficult issues.
[40] RECENT RESEARCH ON THE PREHISTORY OF THE DELAWARE VALLEY
This symposium highlights recent research into the prehistory of the Delaware Valley. A wide
variety of themes are represented by the 12 papers to be presented: 1) bedrock geology and raw
material catchments; 2) regional geomorphology and landform use; 3} faunal resource exploitation
and subsistence strategies; 4) site locational parameters; 5} in-depth site specific studies based on
recent excavations; 6) functional analyses of lithic artifacts related to specific cultural groups; and
7) a view of recent archaeological work in the Delaware Valley as seen by a private tunding agency.
Taken as a whole, these presentations provide a balanced assessment of current research in a major
prehistoric occupation zone of the northeastern United States.
[41] THE CURRENT STATUS OF RESEARCH IN THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
As in many other regions in the Americas, the last several decades have witnessed an explosion
in research in the Southwestern US and adjacent areas. The aim of this symposium is to take stock
of the “state of the art’ of major topical and regional issues. This serves both to make the results of
this work more readily available to those specializing in other geographic areas, and to provide an
opportunity for workers within the region to consider the directions in which future research should
proceed.
[42] TRACKING POLITICAL CHANGE AND SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AT CAHOKIA
Theoretical developments in conjunction with an expanded data base are enabling researchers to
plot the short-term political changes at Cahokia as related to longer-term processes of social stratifica-
tion and hicrarchization. Participants’ measures of community-organizational change, population
centralization, social differentiation, and material-goods mobilization and distribution provide a
composite picture of the mechanisms whereby the rulers of Cahokia maintained regional political
cohesion and interregional prominence. This symposium both defines new parameters for viewing
the scale and configuration of Cahokia’s relations with other midcontinental groups and advances
our perceptions of chiefdoms, Mississippianism, and Native-American civilization.
[43] GEOARCHEOLOGICAL METHODOLOGIES FOR INTERPRETING PREHISTORIC
LANDSCAPES
New or innovative geoarchacological methodologies and approaches to interpret paleolandscapes,
processes, and environments, or to locate, identify and distinguish cultural deposits have been devel-
oped and tested over the last several years. These methodologies and approaches are designed to
_ more selectively and efficiently deal with an array of archaeological] problems, particularly within
the realm of CRM. Experience suggests the broad archaeological public, representing large geographic
; regions, are either unaware of these methodologies or have not seen their usefulness demonstrated.
Participants (geologists, archaeologists, geographers) in this interdisciplinary symposium will present
examples of these methodologies, discuss results and identify future prospects.
[44] TOWARD SENSITIVE INTERPRETATION OF CULTURAL RESOURCES IN A
MULTICULTURAL SOCIETY
Presentations address topics on sensitive interpretation that effectively communicate the actual
experiences and perspectives of defined ethnic/cultural groups relating to archeological, ethnographic,
and historical materials and subjects. Presentations represent experiences relating to a diversity of
ethnic or minority groups, including blacks, Hispanics, American Indians, and others. A major goal
of the session is to identify common denominators associated with the problems and challenges of
developing ethnically sensitive public interpretation programs in multicultural societies. Consistent
with past policy, NPS plans to publish the results of the session.
[45] INTERPRETING SMALL TO MEDIUM-SIZED ARCHAEOFAUNAL REMAINS
Many archacological sites contain a large number of bones trom animals that weigh less than
22,000 grams (coyote-sized or smaller). This symposium presents recent taphonomic research on
raptors, leporids, rodents, small carnivores, reptiles, and fish. This research is designed to shed light
on the prehistoric human exploitation of small to medium-sized animals, and to discuss the role
that nonhuman agents play in depositing these bones in archaeological sites.
[46] AFTER THE LAND BRIDGE: CLIMATE, BIOMES, AND CULTURAL INTERACTION IN
NORTHEASTERN BERINGIA
This symposium examines the current state of inquiries, and honors the contributions of Edwin
S. Hall, Jr. to the anthropology of northern Alaska. In accord with the breadth of Professor Hall's
, [57] Ancestors, Agriculture, and the Archaeology of Place 5
own interests, the contributions range in scope from the earliest cultures of the region to the ethno:
graphic record of the recent past. The papers include accounts of the initial human occupations of
northern Alaska, the interaction of environmental and cultural change, arctic site formation processes,
questions regarding obsidian and chert procurement, utilization and trade, and contact period interac-
tions of native peoples with themselves and with Euroamericans.
[47] ARCHAEOLOGICAL CERAMIC INVESTIGATIONS IN MID-CONTINENTAL NORTH
AMERICA
Recent ceramic investigations in midcontinental North America encompass a range of technical
approaches matched in few other world regions. While investigations of paste composition are yielding
surprising new information about group interaction, engineering studies are providing baseline data
for assessing the performance of different ceramic fabrics. At the same time, existing typological
frameworks are being questioned and new theoretical perspectives on ceramic change are being
proposed, These investigations have set the stage tor major advances in the study of Woodland and
Mississippian pottery,
[48] “CHULLPA” BURIAL HOUSES AND “AYLLU” ORGANIZATION IN THE ANDES
Andean social organization was based on the “ayllu,” a kin-based group focused on an apical
ancestor—a mummy who was venerated in rituals that periodically restructured the power of ances-
tors and descendants relative to one another. To the extent that the ancestral mummy embodied
the “ally,” and its entitlements, appropriate tomb accommodations were a prerequisite for ‘“ayllu’’
organization. This symposium examines formal variation in tombs and their probable relations to
“ayllu’ organization, as well as temporal/spatial distribution tombs appropriate for “ayllu” ancestors.
}49] NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE GULF COAST OF MESOAMERICA
Exciting new discoveries and interpretations have emerged concerning the Gulf Coast of Mesoamer-
ica during recent years. New research has affected our views about the Olmecs in the Preclassic
period, Classic period societies and their relations to Teotihuacan, changing social and political
organization along the Gulf Coast, and alterations of land use under Spanish rule. These studies
include both household and regional scale investigations. The symposium is an effort to introduce
some of the key new findings and relate new information to established understandings of ancient
Mesoamenica.
[55] LATE QUATERNARY PALEOENVIRONMENTS AND HUMAN SUBSISTENCE IN THE
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY
The Central Mississippi River Valley |CMRYV) has served as an important source of natural resources
tor human populations since the late Pleistocene. However, the distributions and abundances of
these resources have fluctuated through time in response to dynamic changes in late Quaternary
environments. To understand the evolution to establish baseline data on biotic resources and land-
scapes which formed the enviromments humans inhabited and exploited. To this end, participants
in this interdisciplinary symposium synthesize gvailable data on the response of landscapes and
biotic communitiés to paledenvironmental changes. Attention is focused on the potential causes of
differences in the paleoenvironmental signals derived from the various proxies. This information is
integrated with analyses of human subsistence strategies.
[56] THE ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY OF SETTLEMENT PATTERN: PASTORAL SOCIETIES
| Ethnoarchacological studies are a powerful middle range research tactic tor linking the archaeologi-
cal record with land use strategies of the past. In this symposium, ethnoarchaeological approaches
| are used to investigate pastoral organization at the intersite or settlement pattern scale. Contemporary
ecological, social and ideological factors are used to relate the spatial distribution of material remains
with pastoral land use strategies of the past. Theoretical discussions on the issue of scale and the
use of ecological variables are complimented by approaches focusing on mobility, occupational inten-
sity, the variable effect of ecological context, location, and place.
157] ANCESTORS, AGRICULTURE, AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PLACE AT K'AXOB,
BELIZE
The K’axob Project is a multi-faceted research endeavor in which the genesis of ancestor veneration
in the Maya lowlands is investigated in its agranan, Formative context, This site provides a case
study of the poorly documented agrarian, kin-organized component of Maya society. K’axob exhibits
an occupational history of pronounced continuity over two millennia. Research papers presented in
this symposium focus on this continuity of place by addressing the following topics: the significance
of ancestral interments within residences; the age, sex, nutritional status and genetic affiliations of
these interments; the ritual sanctification of Formative burial locales through dedicatory caches with
explicit iconographic content; transformation of the physical, agrarian environment around K’axob,

[44] SPANISH MISSION POLICY AND PRACTICE
Inclusion of Spanish colonial mission sites in the National Park system has placed new demands
on the interpretation of contact between Spaniards and American Indians. Spanish mission policy
was neither monolithic or intentionally oppressive. Shifts in crown goals prior to the secularization
of the missions require careful analysis if a sensitive assessment of the mission systems is to be
achieved.

[49] EXCAVATIONS OF LATE FORMATIVE HOUSELOTS AT BEZOAPAN, VERACRUZ
Bezoapan, a small site in the Tuxtla Mountains of southern Veracruz, was occupied from the
beginning of the Late Formative period through the Late Classic. The Late Formative component is
sealed by a volcanic ashfall. Recent excavations of three stratified Late Formative houselots demon-
strate substantial ceramic continuity with both the Middle Formative and Classic periods and test
the applicability of Killion’s HGRA model of houselot structure to Formative domestic contexts.

The ethnohistoric literature for the Spanish contact with the Pueblo Indians is reviewed to develop

a picture of the Pueblo agricultural system. Topics reviewed include crops, field descriptions, agricul-

tural activities, tools, and storage. The documentary literature ranges from 1540 to 1630 and covers

the expeditions of Coronado. Chamuscado-Rodriguez, Espejo, and de Sosa; documents from the
establishment of Onate’s colony; and the memorial of Benavides.

Prof G. Singh’s Rajasthan lakes pollen sequence is the primary source for climatological reconstruc-

tion for late third millennium Indus Valley. The climate shift documented at ca. 2000 BC has been

linked to the collapse of the Harappan civilization. This research is reviewed with regional geological

data, The Rakjasthan lakes are not dependent upon rainfall. The relationship between climate change

and Indus collapse is therefore reexamined from other perspectives.

HASA
A settlement model,suggesting increased mobility within the Middle and across the Middle/Upper

Paleolithic boundary in the Levant is empirically tested with lithic assemblages derived from sites

in the Wadi el Hasa in west-central Jordan. Based upon the test implications put forth, the data is

held to be consistent with the model. Earlier assemblages are shown to exhibit signs of “expedience”’ |

and the later assemblages show evidence of “curation”, a pattern expected with increases in settlement

[113] DENTAL WEAR AND DIET OF LATE PALEOINDIAN AND EARLY ARCHAIC
POPULATIONS FROM NORTH AMERICA: RESULTS OF SCANNING ELECTRON
MICROSCOPY

Scanning electron microscopy (SEM} of the enamel surfaces of the oldest human skeletons in North

America documents a pattern of damage typical of Archaic foragers. The maxillary first molars of

individuals from Wilson-Leonard, Texas (9,470 + 170 yr B.P.|, Gordon Creek, Colorado (9,700 +

250 yr B.P.), Whitewater Draw, Arizona (8,650 + 260 yr B.P.), and Horm Shelter, Texas (9,500 = 200

yt B.P.) exhibited numerous striations and pits, along with extensive polish. This pattern of enamel

damage has been documented for human populations consuming floral resources. Assuming that the
observed microwear reflects dietary consumption, these results suggest that some early Holocene

[28] FOLK NARRATIVES AND ARCHAEOLOGY: CONTRIBUTIONS OF FOLKLORE
METHODOLOGY TO THE ANLAYSIS AND INTERPRETATION OF AN HISTORIC
AFRICAN-AMERICAN CEMETERY

During the widening of State Highway 3 in Galveston County, Texas, a number of historic Afncan-
American graves were exposed near the Albert J. Phillips Memorial Cemetery. Although documents
indicated that all graves within the highway nght-of-way had been exhumed and relocated in 1927,
excavation crews recovered 54 burial features that contained a mix of construction debris and fragmen-
tary human remains. The dialogue established between archaeologists and local residents present
during the 1927 exhumation yielded narratives crucial to the interpretation of the archaeological
assemblage. Folklore methodology was employed to interpret archacological materials and to integrate
the community into the process of archaeological research.

[102] CHRONOLOGICAL TRENDS IN MOUNDVILLE HEALTH

An initial synchronic analysis of elite and nonelite population segments at Moundville indicated
only minor differences in adult stature, childhood stress, dental health, and infectious disease experi-
ence. This new diachronic reevaluation incorporates changing perceptions of Moundville’s history
as mortuary center. The expanded seriation of burials by subphase provides a secure pre-Columbian
context for the paleopathological differential diagnosis of the New World forms of tuberculosis and
endemic treponematosis in this region.

|i] POPULATION AND SETTLEMENT AGGREGATION ON THE PAJARITO PLATEAU: THE

BANDELIER PROJECT

Bandelier National Monument was established in 1916 to protect a vast array of Anasazi pueblos,
cavate dwellings, and fieldhouses scattered across the southern Pajarito Plateau. Occupied from A.D,
1100-1600, the park's archaeology encompasses the 13th century Rio Grande Valley population
boom, presenting an ideal opportunity to examine the social and ecological contexts of aggregation.
Population growth, resource depletion, and competition are presented as key forces in an aggregation
model. Based on a 43% sample survey, and excavation of pre- and post-aggregation pueblos, changes
in site structure, architecture, settlement, demography, biotic, and artifactual remains are presented
and used to challenge the model.

61] PHYTOLITHS, DIRT AND DEBRIS: THE DEVELOPMENT OF A "PARALLEL
TAXONOMY"

This paper outlines the development of a “parallel taxonomy” of phytoliths. This taxonomy is not
based on the classification and identification of indiyidual phytoliths to family or species of plant,
but on the matching of assemblages ‘suites’ of phyolith morphotypes to the natural or cultural
sources from which they derive. This approach has been successfully used to identify the likely
sources of organic waste products recovered from a series of archacological sites in the outer Hebridean
islands off north-west Scotland. The identification of patterns of waste disposal arg crucial to the
interpretation of plant and land resource utilization. In preservational conditions whete carbon-based
fossils, such as pollen and seeds, do not survive, phytoliths may be the only available direct evidence
of plant use, As yet the identification of organic material isysomewhat primitive as much of the
background, analogue studies that are necessary to the interpretation, have yet to be performed. The
initial work, however, indicates the enormous potential of using this approach to the phytolith
analysis.

[45] TAPHONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE SMALL-VERTEBRATE COMPONENT FROM THE
CHARLIE LAKE CAVE PALEOINDIAN SITE (HBRF39), NORTHEASTERN BRITISH
COLUMBIA, CANADA

Recent investigations at the Charlie Lake Cave site, Peace River District, British Columbia, have
yielded, for the first time in Canada, non-human vertebrate remains in direct association with an
excavated and radiometrically dated fluted point component. Currently, some 70 vertebrate species,
representing all five taxonomic classes, have been identified. Other important characteristics of
the faunal assemblage include the predominance and exceptional preservation of terrestrial, small-
vertebrate (< 22,000 g body mass) remains throughout the site’s 4.5 + meters of deposits. Presented
here are the results of a detailed, methodologically exploratory, taphonomic analysis of all identified
small-vertebrate remains from 4 of the site’s 23 |xlm units.

[21] SOCIAL INEQUALITY AND THE ORIGINS OF AGRICULTURE

An argument is made that agriculture and social inequality, two major questions about human
prehistory, share common origins. Examination of archaeological data from the Near East and Europe
documents the almost simultaneous appearance of status differentiation and the use of domesticates.

Focus is on the Levant, the Aegean, and southern Scandinavia. Competing theories for explaining

these processes are reviewed and evaluated.

[72] ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL BONE CHEMISTRY

A number of recent developments in bone chemistry document this area of research as one of high
potential and importance for archaeology. Specific attention will be given to both elemental! and
isotopic investigations that deal with diet, status, and residence. For example, strontium isotopes in
bone and teeth are being used to examine changes in residence during the lifetime of an individual.

Elemental studies, focusing on strontium and barium in bone, have begun to resolve some of the

problems associated with diagenesis, Investigation of diets from other animals using elemental stron-

tium now extends back into the Pliocene. The focus of discussion in this paper will be on recent
developments and future directions in these aspects of bone chemistry.

[61] AMS DATING OF PHYTOLITHS: THE BEARSKIN POINT EXAMPLE

Several aceramic sites on the Canadian Shield have yielded Paleolndian materials in association
with charcoal dates that are much younger. Other contexts (pollen cores) or materials (bone), however,
have yielded dates that are more reasonable. Dating of occluded carbon in phytoliths was tried on
the theory that the opaline silica would protect the carbon from contamination. Minimum dates

«from fire hearths at the Bearskin Point site in Minnesota are substantially older than the charcoal
dates, AMS dating of occluded carbon in phytoliths is a viable alternative dating method.

[83] ASSESSING DESIGN STRUCTURE IN FRAGMENTARY MATERIALS;
METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL ISSUES IN THE SOUTHWEST

Research near Taos, New Mexico centers on developing a method for identifying levels of design
structure in painted potsherds in order to locate patterns that signify closely-interacting pottery
making groups. Methodological focus is on fragmentary materials not appropriate for strategies such
as symmetry analysis. Results support the hypothisis that some aspects of design are subconscious,
subject to behavioral regularities, but less accessible to individual idiosyncratic tendencies that are
difficult to analyze archaeologically, Different types of interaction among pottery makers are indicated
by differing patterns of similaarity in design structure and these relate to larger patterns of social
complexity.

{10} PROSPECT SPRING AND THE WOODLAND-MISSISSIPPIAN TRANSITION ON THE
PRAIRIE-FOREST EDGE OF THE WESTERN MISSOURI OZARKS

The Woodland-Mississippian transition along the prairie-forest ecotone of Southwest Missouri is
not well understood. Prospect Spring is unusual for an open site in this region since this small upland
site has never been plowed, cultural deposits are relatively deep, and bone preservation is unusually
good. Excavations revealed stylistic and functional changes in lithic artifacts over time. Ceramics
and large rock features, suggesting more intensive site utilization, first occur in Mississippian deposits.

[5] WHEN A HOUSE IS NOT A HOUSEHOLD: VARIATION AMONG THE ANCIENT MAYA
COMMUNITIES OF NORTHERN BELIZE

Recent settlement research in northern Belize documents wide variation in the population density
and the distribution patterns of Classic Maya communities. Change over time in the organization
of settlement features indicates important social structural developments were concomitant with
variable population growth. Environmental data suggest that neither population increase and concen-
tration nor subsistence patterns were always determined by local factors. The problem of interpreting
ancient Maya community size, structure, and exploitation strategy as exclusively determined by the
local resources and local needs that can be easily identified archaeologically will be addressed with
reference to data from both Albion Island and Nohmul.

[85] THE CENTRAL COAST OF PERU

The Central Coast of Peru is one of the Andes’ most important regions, both due to the volume
of research that has been done there and, apparently, due to the role it played in prehispanic times.
While the proximity of important archaeological sites to Lima has encouraged research, the intensity
and spread of human settlement has destroyed or buried important sites and material. This paper
will assess current knowledge of the Central Coast throughout prehistory with special emphasis on
the question of its role, at various time, as a center of periphery in cultural dynamics.

bones of mammals, reptiles, amphibia, and mollusks. The analyses performed indicate that groups
inhabiting the Sierpe-Terrabs delta, in addition to agriculture, intensely utilized the mollusk banks
in mangrove areas, estuary fishing, and hunting small vertebrates.

Coastal regions in Panama have quite varied environmental characteristics and settlement histories.
Using data on the distribution and abundance of these resources (e.g., fish, mollusks, crabs, terrestrial

the following questions: (1) to what extent did Panama coastal populations at different times and
places exploit the resources present? (2) what were the relationships between coastal and interior
regions of Panama over time and space, and (3) to what extend can the settlement-subsistence
trajectories found in different coastal areas be explained by the nature and distribution of available
resources? ‘

[93] STAPLE FOODS IN FORMATIVE COASTAL ECUADOR: MAIZE, MANIOC, FISH?

Controversy has surrounded inferences about the food economy of Formative coastal Ecuador, The
importance of fishing vs. agriculture, the presence of maize, and the role of manioc have fueled
debate. We reconsider some of these issues in light of our analysis of stable carbon and nitrogen
isotopes in Formative human skeletal samples, carried out in the context of a control study of the
isotopic ecology of the Coastal Ecuadorian region. Results suggest a gradual change in the food
economy through out the Formative reflecting an increased reliance on maize and regionally greater
importance of sea food. Neither maize nor seafood was dietarily significant during Early Valdivia.

[103] RE-EXAMINING GOBERNADOR POLYCHROME: TOWARD A NEW UNDERSTANDING
OF THE EARLY NAVAJO CHRONOLOGICAL SEQUENCE OF NORTHWESTERN NEW
MEXICO

_ The Gobemador phase of the Navajo occupation of northwestern New Mexico Is defined in part

by the presence of Gobernador Polychrome ceramics and is dated from ca. A.D. 1680 to A-D. 1800.
This ceramic type is generally assumed to have been produced by Pucblo refugees during and after
the Pueblo Revolt. New evidence suggests that Gobemnador Polychrome was solely a Navajo develop-
ment and was being produced by the Navajo at least as early as A.D, 1650. Considering the reliance
on this ceramic type as a defining characteristic of the Gobernador phase, this new evidence calls
into question many of the traditional interpretations conceming the Navajo cultural and chronological
sequence.

[95] INNOVATION AND CONTINUITY IN PRECLASSIC CERAMIC PRODUCTION

Developments in production were traced in the Preclassic ceramic assemblage from the site of

Kichpanha, northern Belize. An initial petrographic analysis revealed distinct clay and temper

resources and technological innovations from the early Middle Preclassic to the Protoclassic periods.

Upon integrating the petrographic data with information available on surface treatments and vessel

forms, a clear picture of the evolution of ceramic production emerged, The results of this study

demonstrated technological and stylistic change for each time period. However, it was also concluded
that later ceramic groups were derived from earlier groups, suggesting a strong tradition of continuity
as well.

[90] HISTORIC DIETARY PATTERNS IN NORTHEAST NEBRASKA
Isotopic studies were carried out to assess variation in historic and prehistoric Nebraska dict.
Collagen-bioapatite 13C spacing values were obtained from ten Ponca and ten prehistoric horticultural
skeletons. The prehistoric range of spacing values was 5.0 to 7.4, with a mean of 6.2. For the Ponca,
the range was 3.1 to 4.7, with a mean of 3.6. These values indicate greater Ponca meat consumption.
These findings are consistent with d13C and d15N values which also indicate greater reliance on meat
and wild plants among historic Omaha in comparison to prehistoric horticulturalists, In comparison of
Omaha values with various animal foods and plant foods, it appears that bison was the main animal
food consumed by the Omaha and Ponca. Both C4 and C3 plants were incorporated in the diet and
a shift away from maize reliance is evident, @

|79] VERTEBRATE FAUNA FROM TRANTS, MONTSERRAT
Trants is a Saladoid site located on the island of Montserrat in the Lesser Antilles. Vertebrate
remains provide evidence for the use of both terfestrial and marine resources. Terrestrial resources
included animals introduced by humans and animals probably driven to extinction by them. Doves
and iguana were also used. Fish in the collection suggest use of primarily rocky bottoms rather than
offshore waters. These data indicate that the people living at Trants knew very well how to make
use of the resources offered by Montserrat and were not unskilled South Americhns unfamiliar with
living in the Caribbean.

[100] A FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF NECKED VESSELS FROM NORTHERN BLACK MESA,
NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA
All functional analyses of prehistoric pottery assume a predictable relationship between the techno-
logical and morphological attributes of ceramic vessels and intended use, an assumption supported
by many ethnographic studies of pre-industrial potters. Expected attributes tor five functional classes
of necked vessels are compared to the attributes of three hundred jars and pitchers collected from
Anasazi sites in northeastern Arizona. Multivariate analyses are used to identify the morphologically
distinct groups of Black Mesa vessels which are then assigned to functional classes. Inferences of
vessel function are evaluated against vessel contents, context, and the presence of any identifiable
use-marks.

|2] THE LANGSTON FARM: RESEARCH MADE POSSIBLE WITH PASSPORT-IN-TIME

The Langston Farm is an archeological and historical site with the only example of rural vernacular
architecture in the Apalachicola National Forest, Florida. The site was first settled in the mid 19th
century and occupied until the late 1970's. Historical research and preliminary archeological testing
began in 1991, done by Forest Service archeologists when time permitted, However, in order to
interpret this unique site to the public, much more information was needed, In June 1992, a P-I-T
project was undertaken to uncover remains of the origina ] structure, a log cabin built in the 1850's.
Project results are detailed in this paper.

[46] CULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL FORMATION PROCESSES: DISTORTION OF THE

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD IN NORTHERN ALASKA

Excavations at the late prehistoric village of Utgiagvik (Barrow), Alaska, gave investigators the
opportunity to observe |) house construction, occupation, and abandonment processes, and 2) environ-
mental site formation processes typical of the Arctic. One house contained the remains of five
individuals, killed when it was crushed by ice. The contrast between houses abandoned by their
inhabitants and the sudden catastrophe which befell the “Frozen Family” enriches our understanding
of both processes as observed in the archaeological record. Documentation of these contrasting
contexts provides a means of recognizing distortions in the archaeological record and making sound
inferences concerning past life in the Arctic.

[39] MODELING THE HUMAN COLONIZATION OF EMPTY LANDMASSES: THE

ADVANTAGES OF OPTIMIZING EXTRACTIVE MALADAPTION
One of the most hotly debated topics in Australian Archaeology is when and how the continent

was first occupied by humans. Two conflicting models have been proposed: that immediately after

entry people radiated rapidly to fill the entire continent or that they moved slowly around the coast

and up the major river systems, before they were able to occupy the desert. We argue that given the

statistical uncertainties inherent in all the currently available chronometric techniques the timing

of colonization cannot be determined. We propose an alternative biogeographically coherent model

which suggests that extractive maladaptation is the optimal colonizing strategy,

The Chinchorro tradition (7800-2500 B.P.) represents the earliest human occupation of the South
American Pacific coast at latitudes of 18 to 24 degrees south. Cultural components associated with
complicated rituals of mummification provide clues for interpreting their socio-political organization,

Analysis of the archaeological record produced by two Navajo families over a fifty year period is

decreases through time. Variability in individual site assemblages is shown to reflect normal short-

the archaeological correlate of increasing occupational intensity as mobility decreases. Implications

[41] SEDENTISM AND MOBILITY IN THE SOUTHWEST
Two conflicting views regarding mobility patterns in the Southwest are gaining broad acceptance.
On the one hand, there is a fairly wide agreement that many or even most pifhouse settlements were
occupied seasonally, and there are good grounds for questioning the degree of sedentism of even some
pueblo sites. On the other hand, recent research has revealed cases of substantial, perhaps sedentary,
occupations extending into the Late Archaic, prior to the widespread appearance of pithouse villages.
I examine this variability, as well as the relation between sedentism and the variable generally
assumed to be most closely associated with it: subsistence.

PLATEAU
b We test a model of the aggregation of the Pajarito Plateau Anasazi from hamlets into villages using
data on stone artifacts gathered during four years of excavation within Bandelier National Monument.
The model proposes that increases in population led to wild resource depletion, agricultural intensifi-
cation, and subsequent aggregation. An increase in regional exchange should also accompany aggrega-
tion. Evidence for an increase in the production of obsidian tools for exchange during the Classic
period, and decreases in the proportions of hunting tools and increases in the proportions of agricultural
implements through time lend some support to the model of Anasazi aggregation.

[78] ENVIRONMENTAL AND AGRICULTURAL STRESS: TWO FACTORS IN THE COLLAPSE
OF LATE THIRD MILLENNIUM SOCIETIES IN WESTERN PALESTINE
Evidence from geomorphology, palynology, oxygen isotopes, and snail shells indicate a wetter
climate during the 4th and 3rd millennia B.C. in Western Palestine. Other evidence from multi-
celled phytoliths suggests that the farming systems of the Early Bronze Age were dependent, at least
in part, upon irrigated cereals cultivated on aggrading flood plains. An abrupt climatic change at the
end of the third millennium led to stream entrenchment, destroying the floodwater farming system.
A decrease in rainfall may also have reduced productivity of olives, a primary export product. The
changes in water flow regimes may have seriously damaged the agricultural economy.

pattern, and other studies are often evaluated in the light of ethnohistorical data and models. Selected
models of cultural adaptation and evolution are reviewed critically in terms of their contribution to
our understanding of late prehispanic social organization in the circum-Titicaca region. To date, the
formulation of regional models of social organization have focused on the more archeologically
conspicuous and politically powerful societies and their relations to hinterland populations whose
own cultural history is assumed and understood only in the context of the dominant society. Review
of literature and models show that local populations in the northern sector of the south-central
Andes, whether at or below the state level of organization, developed different social strategies for
interacting with a wide variety of ethnic groups and ecological zones.

The earliest pottery in North America emerged in the midst of a soapstone cooking technology
that was central to the establishment and maintenance of exchange alliances in the Savannah River
Valley. The new technology, along with innovations to improve thermal efficiency, were slowly
adopted by groups that produced soapstone tools. Stylistic innovations and alternative alliances arose
to offset the social contradictions imposed by such resigtance, Eventually, the widespread use of
pottery contributed to a strategy of fissioning that undermined soapstone trading networks. Patterns
to these sociopolitical processes are evident in the local and regional records of early ceramic vessels.

resources and generally improve the management of prehistoric and historic resources. A brief history
of SAA’s role in the political process and an overview of some cultural resource protection legislation
will be provided.

[44] ETHNICITY AND LAND USE IN THE CHAMA VALLEY
Determining the cultural affiliation of archaeological sites is a recurring goal in north-central New
Mexico, In conjunction with an Army Corps of Engineers water development project involving 47
sites at Abiquiu Reservoir, an integrated archaeological, archival, and oral history approach was used
to delineate use of the Chama Valley by rural populations. Emphasis was placed on defining ethnicity,
land-use practices, and relationships to the Spanish, Mexican, and United States governments. The
results provide a greater understanding of the area’s cultural events than would have been obtained
from either a strictly archaeological or ethnographic approach.

[20] EXPANSION OF THE INCA EMPIRE INTO THE CHACHAPOYAS REGION OF
NORTHEASTERN PERU
This paper focuses on the political penetration of the Inca state into a remote region of the Eastern
Andes in northeastern Peru. Archaeological evidence, of this expansion is derived from pottery,
buildings of dressed stone masonry, terraces, and pase ack found at Cochamarca, Atuen, Papmarca,
and other sites located in the District of Chuquibamba. This evidence supports a substantial socio-
political incursion by the Inca into the eastern margins of the Andes in this region, extending perhaps
as far as the Maranon.

[45] GREAT BASIN TAPHONOMY, HUMAN SUBSISTENCE, AND TAXONOMIC DIVERSITY:
A VIEW FROM ROCK SHELTER, SOUTHWESTERN UTAH
Analysis of over 10,000 faunal specimens retrieved from Rock Shelter identified at least 32 taxa.
Detailed analysis of skeletal attrition found the assemblage to contain a mixture of raptor, erlere
tions and human subsistence debris. Presented are some of the criteria employed in differentiating
between natural and cultural bones, particularly with respect to small mammal accumulations. By
teasing out the non-cultural bone and examining taxonomic diversity of the subsistence refuse versus
the entire site assemblage, a vastly different image of human subsistence comes into view. These
data then are used to re-examine recent studies on variability in Fremont and Fremont-late prehistoric
subsistence patterns.

[46] THE POST-PALEOARCTIC INTERVAL IN THE CENTRAL BROOKS RANGE
This paper attempts to answer the question of what was happening in the Brooks Range during
the apparent 2000 year interval between the Paleoarctic and Northern Archaic traditions, both of
which have been defined on the basis of differing lithic technologies. A review of the defining
characteristics of both traditions is undertaken and local variants are discussed. A model of the
culture history suggests that the Central Brooks Range was continuously occupied at this time period. |

{102} HUMAN SUBSISTENCE AT MOUNDVILLE; THE STABLE ISOTOPE DATA
Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses of approximately 250 human, animal, and maize
samples indicate changes in human subsistence strategies during occupation at pre-Contact Mound-
ville in Alabama. Data suggest increased maize use between Moundville I and the subsequent Mound-
ville I! Phase. Most importantly a decrease in 813C values between Moundville II and the subsequent
Alabama River Phase (t= 2.96, df=53, significant at the 0.01 level, two-tailed test} coupled with a
lack of change in 615N values suggests a decrease in dependence on maize and an increased dependence
on gathered plant foods. This supports earlier hypotheses associating Moundville’s collapse with
diminished productivity of its agricultural lands.

[62] STRATEGIES OF INKA CONTROL IN THE NASCA REGION OF PERU
it has been more than 30 years since Menzel published her summary of the Inka occupation
of the south coast of Peru, based on historic documents and extant archacological data. Recent
archaeological research in the Nasca region provides new information on the nature of local political
centralization at the time of the Inka conquest, and sheds new light on the strategies employed to
consolidate the region under Inka imperial control. Of special interest is the Inka site of Paredones
(Caxamarea), whose elaborate architecture is more typical of the Cuzco region. Why was Nasca so
special to the Inkas, and why did they invest so much in the region?

[33] MISSISSIPPIAN TOWNS IN THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY
The archaeological record of Mississippian towns dating between A.D. 1000 and A. D, 1600 is
characterized by three major dimensions: (1) There is increased nucleation over time, with increas-
‘ingly well-defined town planning; (2) Individual towns show periodic fluctuations in the size of
resident populations, and (3) There are episodic patterns of town abandonment some of which are
surely related to reduced crop yields and declining availability of local resources. There are accompany-
ing changes in economic strategies resulting in greater task specific organization of labor. Patterns
of social and ceremonial interaction and competition among groups are important to describing this
variability.

[40] THE GEOMORPHIC BACKGROUND TO PREHISTORIC OCCUPATION OF THE
CENTRAL DELAWARE VALLEY
Ten years of inter-disciplinary research have produced comprehensive reconstructions of the prehis-

associated with large CRM projects. The present study is an attempt to synthesize individual site
landform and soil formation observations into a regional mode] for landscape change and utilization.
It is based on several stratified sites from the floodplain and terraces of the trunk stream (Delaware
River] bolstered by sequences from tributary streams and diagnostic microenvironments, There are
striking parallels in long-term paleo-geomorphic trends that are punctuated by short-term local
landscape changes. It is possible to infer broad relationships between evolving floodplain environ-
ments and settlement proclivities since Early Archaic times.

{91] STATURE OF THE MADISONVILLE POPULATION IN EVOLUTIONARY AND
ECOLOGICAL CONTEXT

Native American populations of the Ohio area, ranging in time from the Late Archaic to Proto-
historic periods, expressed the same pattern of variation for the components of stature. While these
bodily proportions (‘shape’) were constant through time and across ecological zones, stature |‘‘size’’)
varied significantly. The Madisonville population can be characterized as one of the shortest ever
present in Ohio, with male (n=77) stature averaging 160.6 om (5'3") and female (n=95) stature
averaging 151.2 cm (5'0"). Nutritional stress in this population is seen as a causal factor. This
proposition is examined in light of proposed dietary reconstructions and observed ecological differ-
ences in Ohio populations.

{90} CLIMATIC FACTORS AND CORN-YIELD IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS

Extreme climatic variability is one of the most significant limiting factors for all life on the
Northern Great Plains. Humans have developed strategies which have enabled some cultures to
excede ecosystemic limits for varying lengths of time. The Plains Village horticultural system was
one such strategy. Estimates of the productivity and reliability of this system are quite crude. Data
from the North Dakota Agricultural Experiment Stations in the late 19th and early 20th centuries and
some dendroclimatological studies can be very useful to those attempting to reconstruct subsistence
patterns. Degree-days and precipitation patterns must be considered together.

[23] TRADITONAL CULTURAL PROPERTIES AND THE SECTION 106 PROCESS

Traditional cultural properties are historic properties, eligible to the National Register, that are
important in maintaining the continuing cultural identity of a traditional community. Often know!-
edge of these sites is preserved only in oral traditions, and many can be identified only through
interviews and field visits with knowledgeable people from the traditional community. Most often,
responsibility for identifying and trying to preserve these properties through the Section 106 process
rests with archaeologists, even though most of us have little formal training in ethnographic methods.
This paper offers some definitions and practical advice fo§those who are new to this challenging but
rewarding process.

[107] FROM MICRO TO MACRO: RECONSTRUCTING ECONOMIC INTERRELATIONS

FROM THE GROUND UP

Intra-site economic interrelations can be reconstructed at numerous levels but derivation of robust
interpretations requires building inferences from the ground up. Whether focusing on structures or
extramural activity areas, behavioral boundaries can be identified and their content and organization
analyzed. Through analysis and comparison of patterned data sets at Snaketown it is possible to
identify activities that are replicated across space or restricted in spatial extent. Through such means
the physical attributes and extent of economically cooperating units can be identified. Changes in
configurations of related activity centers can be used to trace changes in the behavioral realm,

[72] GAMMA RAYS, X-RAYS, STONE TOOLS AND THE SOURCING MYTH: ARE WE

MISSING THE POINT?

For nearly 30 years the scientific analysis of archaeological lithic material, particularly obsidian,
has contributed much to our understanding of procurement, exchange, group interaction, and technol-
ogy. The instrumental capabilities of these studies including energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence
(EDXRF), and neutron activation (NAA) have increased tremendously, but in most regions of the
world archaeologists have been slow to integrate these advances in the designs for research. Much
of this is a failure of archaeometry to communicate these advances to archaeology in a meaningful
way. A few recent examples serve to illustrate the problem and a number of probable solutions are
offered for both the archaeometrist and the archaeologist.

[100] TRANSITIONAL PUEBLO DEVELOPMENT IN THE MIMBRES VALLEY, NEW MEXICO

The shift from pithouses to cobble-adobe pucblo-style architecture marked significant changes in
the Mimbres community organization. Most scenarios describe an abrupt change from one type of
structure to another. Using new data from the NAN Ruin, it appears that the process, once started
in the early 10th century A.D., took nearly a century to complete, The shift began by modifying
pithouses and later constructing cobble-adobe rooms with sunken floors in the late 10th century.
These architectural changes were accompanied by mortuary variability, ceramic style change, and
changes in storage facilities, all of which are addressed.

[45] RECOVERY, SKELETAL REPRESENTATION, CONTEXT, AND ETHNOGRAPHIC
LITERATURE: THE CULTURAL ASPECT OF GOPHERS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RECORD

. Gophers have historically been unfairly classified as non-cultural, intrusive taxa in archaeological
assemblages, most notably due to their burrowing behavior within, and destruction to archaeological
sites. Although archaeologists consider gophers as destructive pests, they were also preyed upon by
prehistoric peoples. Since direct evidence for gopher consumption is rare, several lines of evidence
including recovery, skeletal representation, and context all indicate that gophers were procured
prehistorically. This information compares well with the ethnographic literature which shows that
gophers were hunted for medicinal purposes, food, and for crop protection.

This paper summarizes the stages of production of San Martin Orange ceramics produced in Tlajinga
33, Teotihuacan, Mexico, during the Xolalpan Period. The results of analytical studies indicate that
the Tlajinga potters extracted local clays, employed basal molds, used coil as well as slab forming
techniques, fired vessels in a surface or pit-oven environment and graded their ceramic products.
Comparison of these data with those from ethnoarchaeological studies of modern pottings groups
suggest that the Tlajinga potters were practicing a mode of ceramic production consistent with
specialized household production.

Traditional views of Maya sacrifice focus on removal of the living heart. Although heart excision
may have been a cause of death, a combination of morphological analysis of human remains, use-

process did not stop there. Human remains from the Sacred Cenote at Chichén Itza and Uaxactun
exhibit extensive modification, explaining in part the intensive butchery marks documented for
certain Maya lithic artifacts. Defleshing and dismemberment, along with the conversion of body
parts to other ritual artifacts, clearly form a part of the total ritual picture.

For decades Cahuachi, long regarded as the early Nasca capital, was described as an exemplar of
an alleged urban tradition on the south coast of Peru. Recent fieldwork, however, reveals that Cahuachi
had a scarce permanent population, was the locus of intense ceremonial activities possibly revolving
around a pilgrimage cycle, and was “monumentally unmonumental”—built by terracing naturally
truncated hills rather than creating massive free-standing architecture as was the case elsewhere
along the Peruvian coast at this time (c. A.D. 1-300). Among the dense settlement pattern of supporting
habitation sites in the neighboring valleys is one whose size and density of agglutinated architecture
suggest that it was the urban (or urban-like) center Cahuachi was not. The nature of early Nasca
sociopolitical organization and the role of ceremonialism and possible urbanism in integrating the
component Nasca groups are examined.

Small mammals are buffer food resources for human population. In coastal Andean sites of central

Prehistoric populations selectively consumed rodent species of large body size and weight, which
are diurnal and fossorial or colonial. Consumption, though, was temporally and spatially variable.
If profitable reliable resources were available, rodent consumption was secondary, albict selective.
That is the case of coastal population and horticulturalists. The former relied more heavily on marine

material resources to archacologists, who in turn generated fresh collections of ancient items for
their sponsors. They also fired public imagination with tales of their exploits, thereby helping to fill
museum coffers. The symposium will explore this symbiotic relationship and its lasting impact on
the development of both the discipline and the harboring institution. Individual papers will examine
different facets of their complex association to create a dynamic, diachronic picture of a still-evolving

Recent archaeological research in East and Southeast Asia is represented by the growth in, and
innovative uses of, social perspectives as frameworks to examine and interpret this area's prehistory
and early history. Several important theoretical issues are examined in this session, including: the
spatial expression of segmentation, the development of ritual and its sociopolitical uses, the develop-
ment of craft specialization, the context of interpolity interaction, and the development of complex
societies. This symposium highlights the contributions the East and Southeast Asian archacological
record can make to our anthropological understanding of the complex nature of social processes.
[72] ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE; PAST ACHIEVEMENTS/FUTURE DIRECTIONS

This symposium will present reviews of major accomplishments of the various segments of archaeo-
logical science fields since the appearance of Science and Archaeology (2nd edition 1969) in terms
of how interdisciplinary data generated as a result of natural science/archacology mtertace have
influenced current archaeological views and research agendas. Contributors will project the course
of archaeological science studies over the next decade and offer predictions of how these studies will
influence future archacological investigations both in the field and in the laboratory.

[73] INTERREGIONAL PROCESSES AND INTERPRETATIVE MODELS IN THE SOUTHERN
CONE OF SOUTH AMERICA

The purpose of this symposium is to synthesize critically some recent literature and investigations
in different regions of the Southern Cone of South America. The coverage by participants focuses
on cultural historical and/or cultural processual models of local development and interregional interac-
tion for different cultural developmental periods and/or specific topics of investigation.

[74] STUDENT AFFAIRS COMMITTEE WORKSHOP “IS THERE A FUTURE IN
ARCHAEOLOGY?”

The future of Archaeology is of critical importancéto students. Upon graduating, students will
encounter a diverse array of career opportunities: from academia to CRM, museums, state and federal
agencies, and, increasingly, private or corporate employers. Workshop participants will discuss these
options in terms of educational background and preparation, historical and demographic trends, and
additional factors such as gender and minority representatgon and opportunities, Particular emphasis
will be given to the relationships between alternative career paths and how students can best prepare
for their professional life. Following the presentations, an open forum question-and-answer session
will conclude with informal, small group discussions on topics such as vitae, cover letters, and
interviews, \

[75] RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE BELIZE VALLEY

During recent years, archaeological investigation of the Belize Valley has intensified as marked by
the initiation of several new projects, The area had been the focus of earlier investigations, the most
notable being the pioneering settlement survey directed by Gordon Willey. The cumulative data base
from the various projects makes the Belize Valley one of the most intensively examined regions of
the Maya Lowlands. Recently collected survey and excavation data have enabled researchers to refine
existing models and provide new insights relevant to the reconstruction of the sociopolitical system
of the Valley.

[76] LETTING THE PRESENT SERVE THE PAST: THE DYNAMICS OF AN ANCIENT MAYA
COMMUNITY
To know the past one must study the present. This statement reflects a central concern of anthropo-
logical archaeology which seeks to link contemporary and archaeological records in ways to build a
better understanding of the past. Two completed field seasons at the ancient Maya center of Sayil
have produced intensive site-scale surface data that reflect community settlement patterns. The next
interpretive stage of this research draws upon the contemporary record, mainly Puuc ethnoarchaeol-
ogy, to establish controlled inferences and relevant behavioral models of Maya community organiza-
tion centering on site-wide activities and community behavior across the entire urban center.

Sacred sites of Indian people are not given the same respect accorded to churches. A historical
perspective of geopolitics and religion brings the issue of Indian sacred sites into focus. Indian
groups around North America are organizing to protect religious freedom and sacred sites. Increased
interaction and understanding between archaeologists and Indians dealing with sacred lands issues
is important to ultimate solutions.

j60] THE LAND BETWEEN: COSTA RICAN ARCHAEOLOGY DURING THE LAST 25 YEARS
The last 25 years of scientific investigations in Costa Rica have elucidated many aspects of cultural
evolution and interpretation of significance to New World archaeology. While its populations evolved
“in place” via local adaptation rather than migration, it has yielded artifact and settlement pattern
complexes that reflect a position on a shifting cultural frontier. Northern (Mesoamerican) influences
gradually yield to South American affinity over time, in prestige material (jade/gold), house type
(rectangular/round) and settlement pattern (dispersed/internally-opposed). Diachronic exploitative
strategies have also shifted from inland sites to coastal niches. Modern methods (remote sensing)
are moving Costa Rican archaeology into a mature cross-disciplinary test of these patterns.

[109] ARCHAEOLOGY AND PUBLIC POLICY IN NEW YORK
The size and complexity of New York bureaucracy rivals that of the federal government, Archaeolo-
gists working in New York must be mindful of programs, obligations and opportunities at both
the federal and state levels. Recent history suggests that archaeology and the historic preservation
movement will become increasingly closely associated in the next century, and that archaeologists
should be looking to take advantage of the resulting opportunities. Academic archacologists are
advised to view these opportunities as supplementary to grant-supported research, and preferable to
standard contract archaeology.

to illustrate the application because we can identify past environmental phenomena and also assume

[8] INTRODUCTION: THE IMPORTANCE OF PALEONUTRITION AND A SUMMARY OF A
CONFERENCE
The history of dietary research in archaeology indicates that each dietary discipline has developed
and evolved as a separate field, with little integration between the disciplines. Integration, however,
is necessary to determine the diet, health, and nutriton of a prehistoric population and such analyses
are becoming more common in archaeological reconstructions, This paper presents the background
and results of a conference on paleonutrition in which researchers interested in all aspects of dietary
and health reconstruction were brought together to present their research and discuss the positive
aspects and inherent limitations in conducting integrative research. The result was a consortium

The “creative explosion” in Central and Eastern Europe during the Upper Paleolithic is very
discontinous in time, space, medium, context, and intentionality. This paper critically examines this

Prior to the mid-1400s the southern Plains and the eastern portion of the Pueblo world are character-

identification of a boundary between the two areas is problematic and not to the point. However,
the historical processes of Pueblo migration into the Rio Grande valley, Pueblo aggregation, and the
arrival of Athapaskan populations on the southern Plains created a situation of contrast that pro-
foundly altered Plains-Pueblo relations in the fifteenth century, This paper elaborates on the transition
in pre-historic Plains-Pueblo relations.

[43] APPLYING DISTRIBUTIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY TO THE SUBSURFACE: SOME INITIAL
OBSERVATIONS
’ Distributional Archaeology has been advocated as a regional approach to the study of landuse.
Many landscapes, however, are, at a minimum, geologically dynamic over the late Pleistocene and
Holocene resulting in the burial of artifacts below landform surfaces, If Distributional Archaeology
is to be effective, sampling of the subsurface must be incorporated. In this paper] suggest a geomorphic
approach based on sampling landform/sediment assemblages and discuss alternative subsurface recov-
ery techniques. Sampling focused on estimates of artifact concentrations in sediment units is advo-
cated. Estimates are enhanced if both macro and micro artifacts are recovered. Examples from the
Midwest U.S. are presented.

[110] OLIVE OIL: FUELING THE ECONOMY OF THE LEVANT AND EGYPT IN THE EARLY
BRONZE AGE
Texts from the eighth century B.C. to Ottoman times suggest that the Levant was the leading
producer, and Egypt the leading consumer, of olive oil. This gelationship was already established by the
Early Bronze Age (3500-2250 B.C}. Discoveries of Early trove oil factories permit the identification of
pottery vessels used in the processing, storing and transportating of olive oil. The demand for oil,
especially from Egypt, and the corresponding increase in oi! production in parts of Syria-Palestine,
coincides with early state formation. This paper assesses the role of oil in the emergence of early
Levantine states. i

[70] STRATIGRAPHY AND CHRONOLOGY OF AVIAN EXTINCTION IN EASTERN
POLYNESIA
The Tangatatau Rockshelter (site MAN-44, Mangaia, Cook Islands) has produced 1000 identifiable
bird bones with exceptional chrono-stratigraphic data. Of the 14 extirpated species of landbirds
recorded at MAN-44, 11 occur only in the 5 deepest of 19 major strata, dated at 700-1000 yr B.P.
Similar extinction chronologies exist for Tahuata (Marquesas Islands) and Huahine (Society Islands),
while the loss of most landbirds occurred centuries earlier on some other islands in the Cooks and
Marquesas. Interisland differences in chronology of avian extinction suggest that the permanent
settlement of East Polynesian islands was asynchronous even within archipelagos.

[82] A LOCATIONAL ANALYSIS OF MISSISSIPPIAN MOUND CENTERS IN SOUTHWESTERN
ILLINOIS
Large Mississippian-period settlements are generally located in floodplain environments, in proxim-
ity to aquatic resources and fertile, well-drained soils suitable for horticulture. Site location is also
affected by proximity to key resources such as chert and secondary streams providing access to adjacent
uplands. The importance of these factors is evaluated in a locational analysis of tour Mississippian sites
situated in the Mississippi River floodplain of extreme southwestern Illinois. The environmental
settings of the Ware, Linn, and Dogtooth Bend mound centers and the Twenhafel site are compared
in order to evaluate ecological aspects of Mississippian settlement in that region.

and considerably smaller during the Moundville II and Il] phases (AD 1250-1550), The frequency of
burials shows exactly the opposite pattern. These data imply that the nature of the site changed
through time, reflecting broader processes in the development of the Moundville polity.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES: THREE CASE STUDIES
Whereas small animal remains from archaeological sites are often integral to arguments about
human diet, use of these data is complicated by the normal influences of other, cocxisting carnivores
on bone midden formation. This paper describes on-going research on ways to distinguish human
and canid modification of the bones of lagomorphs and other small prey in archaeological contexts.
Working from modern control sets consisting of bone from the scats of free-ranging canids, three

[47] CERAMIC PASTE AND BODY VARIABILITY AS INDICES OF CULTURAL
INTERACTION BETWEEN CAHOKIA AND ITS NORTHERN HINTERLANDS DURING

Petrographic analysis was conducted on a series of ceramic vessels of the types Powell Plain and
Ramey Incised from the American Bottom and from the major Cahokia-influenced sites to the north
of the American Bottom dating to the interval A.D. 1000-1200. In addition, for comparative purposes,
companion vessels of demonstrable local manufacture were included from the northern hinterland
site. Through the comparison of both quantitative and qualitative data generated by this analysis, a
pan-regional ceramic recipe for Powell-Ramcy ceramics can be identified that suggests localized
production and redistribution of these types from the American Bottom.

[76] WHAT, IF ANYTHING, IS SETTLEMENT ECOLOGY?

Archaeologists have developed or adopted theoretical frameworks for hunter-gatherer settlement
patterns and market town settlement patterns, but the theory of agrarian settlement remains poorly
developed. This paper outlines an approach to fsettlement ecology/ focusing on the effects of agricul-
tural ecology and relations of agricultural production on spatial organization. This approach is particu-
larly concerned with responses to rising land pressure, and it differs from landscape ecology in its
stress on the relationship between the fsocial and physicalf landscapes. Ethnoarchaeological data
on the Nigerian Kofyar show which aspects of an agrarian settlement pattern are best explained by
settlement ecology.

[112] EUROPEAN CONTACT AND HEALTH: THE EVIDENCE FROM TWO SKELETAL

POPULATIONS FROM THE APALACHEE PROVINCE, NORTH FLORIDA

A good test case of the effect of European contact in the Americas is provided by comparing
skeletons from the precolumbian Mississippian chiefdom Lake Jackson Mound 3 site and the Spanish
mission at Patale. Following one population from precontact to early contact allows insight into how
lifestyle changes and new diseases affected Native Americans. Comparison of age-at-death profiles and
paleopathological indicators here reveal that the impact of contact was complex and not necessarily all
negative, The effects of contact on health probably varied from group to group and were influenced
by the nature of the precontact culture.

[33] ON THE NATURE OF WESTERN KENTUCKY MISSISSIPPIAN TOWN COMPOSITION

Although much has been written about Mississippian architectural elements and town plans, the
literature generally falls short of presenting an understanding of these towns as communities, espe-
cially where ethnohistoric data are lacking; the archatlogical chiefdoms associated with Mississip-
pian towns seem little more than metaphorical appendages to the people who built and lived in
them. Within the context of a regional interpretation of Mississippian communities, we discuss a
developing functional grammar of western Kentucky towns and discuss their cultural implications,
Individual towns illustrate rules or exceptions to them. §

Basal strata in Trou Magrite reveal ephemeral occupations by Neandertals,and extensive use by
carnivores and owls. Upper levels with rich Aurignacian artifacts and faunal assemblages terminated
at 27 ka bp. There are taphonomic indications of a high degree of intactness. Retouched tools are
mainly on imported flint, whereas local limestone was used to produce simple flakes and blades.
The open-air site of Huccorgne shows extensive in situ flint blade production, with numerous refits
in the Gravettian level (23 ka bp). Mammoth, horse and red deer were hunted during a brief humid
phase before the Last Glacial Maximum. A separate area produced Mousterian artifacts with Levallois

[8] THE VALUE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL FAUNAL REMAINS FOR PALEODIETARY
RECONSTRUCTION
Faunal remains from archacological sites provide critical data for paleodietary reconstructions.
They do not represent a complete inventory of animal foods, much less the exact quantities of meat
and nutrients, however, they provide dietary evidence unattainable through studies of paleofeces
and human skeletons. Studies of midwestern sites, primarily from Llinois and Missoun, document
temporal shifts in Holocene faunal assemblages, For the most part, these studies do not examine
nutrition, per se. However, the importance of nutrition has been considered by other researchers
through linear programming models. These models, although subject to their own problems, provide
a framework for examining the potential importance of these subsistence shifts to human nutrition.
This study emphasizes animal foods, but integrates botanical data from the region and bioanthropologi-
cal data when posible.
Styles, Bonnie (Illinois State Museum)
[55] THE CHANGING USE OF FAUNA IN HUMAN SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES
Faunal remains from Holocene archaeological sites in the Central Mississippi River Valley docu-
ment changing faunal availability and exploitation strategies. Early Holocene faunal assemblages
show distinctly high representation of small mammals, in conjunction with white-tailed deer. In the
Middle Holocene, proportional representation of white-tailed deer and aquatic resources increases.
These subsistence shifts are attributed to natural environmental changes, such as the opening of
the forest and floodplain evolution during the Hypsithermal, and cultural changes, such as in the
distribution and duration of human occupations. Late Holocene sites show an upward trend in the
use of aquatic resources and an apparent decrease in the representation of terrestrial resources,
especially white-tailed deer. These trends reflect the economic strategies and impacts of more seden-
tary populations with a greater reliance on cultivated plants.

Archaeological evidence of prehistoric looting episodes at Teotihuacan 1s examined. The looting

Radiocarbon dates from the looters’ tunnel discovered recently in the Feathered Serpent Pyramid

artifacts to legitimate their religious and political hegemony. Possible ideological motives for looting
graves in monuments are discussed, and the socio-political implications are considered in the light of
new excavation data. The original burial contexts before looting are reconsidered in this interpretative

[58] MID-HOLOCENE SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE ADAPTATION IN THE MOJAVE

DESSERT

At the end of the Pleistocene, a large interior lake system was present in the Mojave Desert and
people were adapted to the associated environments. As early as 9000 B.P. conditions had become
more xeric, resulting in the desiccation of the lake systems and a shift in settlement/subsistence
activities to other ecozones. The situation persisted until the Mid-Holocene when environmental
conditions improved (ca. 4,000 B.P.). At that time evidence of increased moisture, a distinct change
in lithic technology, increased social complexity, and increase in population {e.g. in known sites) are
evident in the archaeological record. Several settlement/subsistence models are outlined to account
for these changes.

[8] NUTRITION, SMALL MAMMALS, AND AGRICULTURE

The significant role of small mammals in the diet of prehistoric agriculturalists in the Greater
Southwest is addressed in this presentation. Changes in methodologies have led to the greater recovery
of small animals allowing for the assessment of their depositional history and in turn a consideration
of their role in the diet. The modifications prehistoric inhabitants made to their environment through
agriculture and associated activities created an environment particularly favorable to small animals
such as rodents and lagomorphs. The hunting of small animals, however, extended far beyond garden
hunting and was incorporated into other daily activities. Changes in socio-economic and demographic
factors that accompanicd agricultural activities are argued to have contributed to the importance of
small animals in the diet.

Lake Jackson Mound 3 is compared to the Patale Spanish mission population (n = 40} dated c.a. A.D.

had an increased level of meat in their dict relying more on terrestrial resources than marine resources.

This subsistence pattern indicates improved diet under the Spanish mission compared to pre-contact

conditions.

This paper examines patterning evident in the distribution and configuration of Upper Paleolithic
sites in the Ribeira da Pa, Rio Maior, and Penegral drainages in central Portugal. Artifact occurrences
correlate with specific geomorphological features, most notably low terraces along drainages. Inten-
sive survey methodology eliminates geological visibility as an explanation of this pattern. Comparison
between Gravettian and Magdalenian sites, the two largest samples, reveals that land use, flint
procurement, and curation patterns differ between the two periods. Lithic assemblage data are ana-
lyzed with attention to flint sources in combination with known technological shifts. The data set
illustrates underlying interrelationships between lithic technology, raw material availability, and
site distribution.

James River at the base of the Falls, revealed a Late Archaic Component and stratified Woodland
Components. Tool manufacture from terrace cobbles was an important function of the Late Archaic
Component, and at least one of the Woodland Components. Other site functions include exploitation
of anadromous fish runs. A consistent pattern of resource exploitation at the Falls Zone through
time is shown, along with some implied differences.

[56] ETHNO AND OTHER ARCHAEOLOGIES: OBSERVATIONAL SCALES AND
INTERPRETIVE POTENTIALS

Ethnoarchaeology has produced insights into relationships between human systems and the produc-
tion, distribution, and eventual discard/loss of items and the creation of a material record. However
attempts to use results of ethnoarchaeological studies in archaeological analyses face major differences
in scale of observation for the two data sets. caneeneetans customarily deals with large-scale,
event-oriented aspects of site production. Archaemogical analysis must address problems of long-
term accumulations of information resulting from aggregate actions of human and non-human pro-
cesses, One way for more convergent results is for ethnoarchaeological studies to place greater
emphasis on variables suitable for archaeological analysis.

[56] “UP AND DOWN WE MOVE..”: FACTORS CONDITIONING AGRO-PASTORAL
SETTLEMENT ORGANIZATION IN MOUNTAINOUS SETTINGS \

A cross-cultural exploration of mountainous environments is used to highlight specific ecological
factors that appear to condition agro-pastoral land-use strategies. A broad range of settlement options,
common to ecologically similar yet culturally diverse settings’ are identified. A closer scrutiny of
selected Andean case studies is then used to explore the variability noted in settlement options.
Factors such as the geomorphological and climatic characteristics of specific localities, ethological
requirements of domesticated animals, cultigen production constraints, and regional demographic
patterns are seen as conditioning the specific forms of settlement pattern noted cross-culturally.

[62 ETHNOGENESIS IN HUAMACHUCO
The Inca administration of northern Peru involved a greater restructuring of the local population
than previously thought. These changes were of such great extent that both 16th century chroniclers
and modern scholars have mistakenly assumed that the people of Huamachuco and Cajamarca
belonged to the same ethnic group. In fact, there is little archaeological or ethnohistoric evidence to
support that view. The Inca split closely related ethnic groups into different administrative units,
lumped unrelated groups together, and modified their internal structure.

A variety of burial patterns has been documented for the sites of Marcahuamachuco and Cerro
Amaru in the northern sierra of Peru between A.D. 400 and 1000, Individuals were interred in
monuments of high visiblity, in more ordinary mausoleums, and in caves. Secondary burials were
common in the walls of structures interpreted as halls dedicated to celebration of the ancestors.
Some patterns appear to emphasize lineage affiliation, while others honour specific individuals-
probably putative lineage founders. The relationship between burial patterns and socio-political
organization is explored.

[103] THE PUEBLITO PHENOMENON: A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON POST-REVOLT NAVAJO
CULTURE
Pueblitos are small masonry structures built in defensive locations throughout the Navajo territory
of the 18th century. Pueblito construction began after the Spanish Reconquest of New Mexico in
AD 1692 and has been used as evidence of a massive immigration of Pueblo Refugees that dramatically
changed Navajo culture. This paper examines the entire Pueblito phenomenon from a temporal and
geographic perspective. Results indicate that these structures are temporally unrelated to the Spanish
Reconquest and geographically distant from areas of Spanish influence, Explanations for the appear-
ance of pueblitos and implications for the study of early Navajo culture are offered.

The results of a recent project in the Jemez Mountains of New Mexico, employing new survey

ascribed to three major classes of religious and social meaning of a specific Rio Grande Puebloan
group. In this paper we discuss the theoretical and methodological components of this project, present
the contextual data within which the art possesses meaning and offer preliminary conclusions as to
its social relevance, both past and present.

Petroglyphs in the Black Hills that depict hunting related themes have been viewed as a single

beginning during Clovis times. Some themes depicted indicate longer term cultural continuity than
expected. An attribute analysis, however, demonstrates several major temporal changes. The use
of common archaeological techniques, such as attribute analyses, provides greater descriptive and
explanatory power than the subjectively defined styles generally used in rock art studies.

EXCAVATED BIOTIC MATERIALS FROM BANDELIER NATIONAL MONUMENT

The results of macrobotanical and faunal analyses are reported from recent excavations at several
Pueblo period habitation sites within Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico. Macrobotanical
data are compiled and diversity and ubiquity indices are used to illustrate temporal differences in
the utilization of prehistoric botanical resources. Faunal data are also reported, and a net caloric
approach is used to demonstrate temporal change in resource selection. Finally, the results of the
macrobotanical and faunal analyses are used to critically examine a model of population aggregation
in which the availability of natural biotic resources may be related to intensified agriculture.

This paper examines relationships of structure, site, and regional abandonment processes in the
thirteenth-century American Southwest, Mesa Verde—region abandonment processes are considered
in a case study of forty pitstructures from a 225 km2 study area. Small mesa-top residential sites were
abandoned in the mid A.D. 1200s, and population aggregated into larger settlements. Stratigraphic data
indicate that wooden beams were salvaged from small sites, though some small sites were still used
seasonally after their pitstructures were destroyed. Construction timbers were destroyed in the
abandonment process only when the entire region was abandoned in the A.D. 1280s.

[17] GENETIC STRATIGRAPHY, CLIMATE CHANGE AND PALEOSOL DEVELOPMENT
WITHIN THE SUSQUEHANNA RIVER DRAINAGE BASIN
The primary goal of genetic stratigraphy is the development of a high resolution chronostratigraphic
framework which enhance predictive stratigraphy. Paleosols on low terrace contexts within the
Susquehanna basin are ideal basic genetic units for establishing a chronostratigraphic framework.
Because they reflect extensive temporal stability, paleosols, in general are allogenic genetic units
traceable over considerable distances. Tentative connections between buried A-horizons and region-
wide environmental conditions have been suggested but never formalized into a comprehensive
framework. The concept of genetic stratigraphy provides a means of evaluating this pattering of and
distinguishing between local and regional variability in sedimentary records.

unsupportable until the final stage of the Neolithic. These ceramic changes reflect larger social and
economic changes. The model is tested with evidence from elsewhere in the Eastern Mediterranean.

the conditions-institutional and cultural-that influence their including archacology.

Historically, the Mississippi River basin housed the most diverse fauna of freshwater mussels
(Mollusca: Bivalvia; Unionoidea) in the world. Assemblages of mussel shell from geological and

River and its tributary streams, Dynamics of the mussel fauna have important implications for the

of the archaeological record; and (3) furnish a reconstruction of the prehistoric landscape setting of
a site to understand human-land interactions. Geoarchacological studies are an indispensable part
at modern archaeological research which enhances the interpretation of archacological data and our
understanding of human prehistory.

ECONOMICS?

Several cultural changes appear to have occurred in the Australian archacogical record about
4000BP. A marked technological shift, the introduction of smAll tools frequently made on blades,
was apparently synchronous with the preservation of sites indicative of greater populations, longer
occupation or increased extractive capacity. The reasons for this apparent ‘intensification’ are hotly
debated. It is argued here that ‘intensification’ was the optimal human response to the 2, 0
variance and unpredictability of the Australian environment and that it occurred repeatedly. Such
complexity is an integral feature of the human capacity for cultural adaptation.

element correlations, and Ca/P ratio were analysed to monitor diagenesis after each treatment. Results
revealed that most of the analyzed elements were affected by diagenesis. Applied cleaning dealt
successfully with contamination. Diagenesis on each investigated site should be examined in a
similar experiment. Simple application of mechanical and chemical cleaning will not ensure that

PERIOD CHRONOLOGY, SETTLEMENT AND MORTUARY PATTERNS IN WESTERN

Excavations in the Wickliffe Mounds cemetery in 1991-92 revealed an unexpected complexity of
deposition in Mound C, Stratigraphic relationships indicate that the cemetery is intrusive into the
site, and thus post-dates village abandonment circa A.D. 1350. Efforts to trace the full extent of the
cemetery were partly sucessful, and revealed additional complexity in burial pattern; burial density
varies, suggesting deliberate clustering within a delimited space. No evidence for a mortuary structure

continued use of the site as an “empty” ceremonial center, best fits current data.

[103] MATERIAL CORRELATES OF EARLY NAVAJO CERMONIALISM
Two Navajo archeological sites have been excavated within a limited portion of the Gobernador ,
Canyon area. Gobernador Canyon is part of the traditional Navajo homeland known as Dinetah.
These sites contain evidence of ceremonial behavior. The evidence includes one internal feature
indicative of dry painting and one effigy. Dates range from the Dinetah throughethe Gobernador
phases. Archaeological methods in concert with ethnographically derived information provide a basis
for interpretation of these cultural remains in the context of Navajo culture,

[37] INTENSIVE AGRICULTURE, SOCIAL STATUS, AND MAYA DIET AT PACBITUN,
BELIZE
Stable isotope ratios are analyzed on bone collagen of 34 individuals from the ancient Maya site
of Pacbitun to determine possible associations between diet, social status (indicated by core zone vs.
periphery burials, burial wealth, etc.}, and shifts in agricultural practices. In addition, the environmen-
tal distinction of the site makes it an interesting comparison with previously studied sites of Copan
and Lamanai.

[76] INDIGENOUS LANDSCAPE CLASSIFICATION AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF EARLY
RICE AGRICULTURE IN THAILAND
Archaeologists working in Thailand expected the settlement pattern of early agricultural villages
to be oriented toward soils appropriate for cither swidden or wet rice cultivation. However, these
sites dating to the 2nd and 3rd millennium B.C, are not found near soils considered most suitable
for either dry or wet rice cultivation. Ethnoecological research revealed an indigenous landscape
classification system that is more differentiated than scientific schemes. The indigenous system
refines our understanding of the distribution of the early farming settlements relative to natural
resources, and provides a basis for a new model for the development of early rice agriculture.

[91] FORT ANCIENT FAUNAL EXPLOITATION AT THE MADISONVILLE SITE
The analysis of faunal remains from recent excavations at the Madisonville site reveals a typical
Fort Ancient assemblage with an abundance of white-tailed deer and turkey followed by medium
and small sized mammals. The large quantity and excellent preservation of remains from white-
tailed deer permit an assessment of the economic importance of deer at Madisonville. Analysis of
deer body part representation facilitates evaluation of potential density-mediated destruction of deer
bone and transport of meat to or from the site.

[98] LATE ARCHAIC SHELL MOUND COMPONENTS IN THE APALACHICOLA DELTA
WETLANDS, NORTHWEST FLORIDA
Deeply stratified levels in Rangia shell mounds in the lower Apalachicola Valley estuary/nver
swamp contain 3000-4000-year-old Late Archaic deposits with plain and simple-stamped fiber-tem-
pered ceramics, clay balls, and microtools and cores, Relationships with Elliott's Point/Poverty Point
adaptations along the Gulf Coast and up the Mississippi are suggested, especially by the lithic
assemblages. The fiber in the ceramics is identified as Spanish moss. On the east side of the delta
the Late Archaic materials are in an oyster shell matrix, suggesting a difference in environmental
salinity associated with a different fluvial history.

[7] PUTTING TOGETHER THE PIECES; SOCIAL AND SYMBOLIC ORGANIZATION IN
HUNTER-GATHERER SITE STRUCTURE
Ethnoarchaeological and archaeological site structural studies provide a systematic framework for
describing and explaining, at a mechanical level, activity areas and the small-scale spatial patterning
of debris on occupation sites. They are less able to cope with overall site patterning, in terms of the
relationships between different activity arcas, precisely because site structural approaches have tried
to circumvent the inherent difficulties of dealing with the social and symbolic meaning of spatial
relations within past societies. The significance of these factors is addressed through ethnographic
. data, and a generalising approach toward the development of archeological theory is pursued.

[11] THE SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF THULE WHALE BONE DISTRIBUTIONS: A CASE STUDY
FROM THE CENTRAL CANADIAN ARCTIC
Poorly understood carcass butchery and bone transport criteria, and a high degree of whale bone
use and reduction even centuries after the animal's death, have long hindered zooarchaeological
assessments of the contribution of bowhead whales to Thule Eskimo subsistence economies. Thor-
ough plotting of whale bone distributions in the vicinity of Thule settlements now allows formal
quantification of inter- and intrasite associations between various element and feature types. The
benefits of this approach are illustrated by a local density analysis of extensive surface bone scatters
recently recorded on Somerset Island, Northwest Territories.

this exists in the current literature. Current research in the Little River Lowland of Southeast Missouri
is ongoing to sort out and document the rich variabiltiy of the record for this time period, Spatial

[13] PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF ANALYSIS OF HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS FROM
IXIMCHE, GUATEMALA

Ongoing analysis of human bones and associated artifacts is revealing details of the Late Postclassic/
Contact period at Iximche, Guatemala, a highland Cakchiquel/Spanish site. Decapitations studied
so far resulted from pre-Conquest sacrifices, not Spanish actions. Although no evidence of damage
to Cakchiquel bones from metal weapons has been encountered, undoubted European artifacts found
with bones amplify the meager archaeological evidence of Spanish presence published by Guillamin.
Frequencies of paleopathological indicators of stress are clarifying the social status of-individuals
and stable isotope analysis is allowing dietary reconstruction.

[45] PREHISTORIC TOAD-LICKING IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS? I DON'T THINK

One large pit feature on a late prehistoric village site in western North Carolina yielded thousanlds
of bones of toads (genus Bufo), suggesting to one analyst that “these animals were deliberately
exploited, possibly for use as a medicinal or hallucinogenic agent.” Recent experimental entrapment
data and naturalistic observations of toad breeding, however, strongly argue for a natural accumulation
of these remains in the feature.

Archaeologists too often rely on surface artifact distributions without regard for geological context.
This study compares a hypothetical excavation strategy based on surface artifacts with one imple-
mented to establiosh geological context and target artifact-bearing deposits. Napoleon Hollow consists
of stratified fluvial and colluvial deposits. Mechanical and manual means of documenting deposits
met with varying degrees of success. Five distinct artifact-bearing deposits, four of which without
surface manifestations, crosscut geological facies and are not consistently superimposed, underscoring
the imperative of establishing geological context prior to archaeological investigation,

[76] LAND USE ZONES AND SETTLEMENT SIZE IN THE JAZIRA REGION OF TURKEY,
SYRIA AND IRAQ
Land use mapping of modern agricultural systems in the area of Kurban Hoyuk on the Turkish
Euphrates near Urfa, indicates the extent to which the modem agrarian economy is geared towards
crop production for trade and export, This can be contrasted with results of field studies of Late
Roman and Early Bronze Age land use -settlement systems that show high and moderate intensity
cultivation systems were practiced over more limited areas. Although there may have been some
localised export or exchange of grain or lentils, the model that best fits the field evidence is that
which requires each settlement or settlement-system to produce just sufficient goods for its needs.
Applying such an equilibrium model to Chalcolithic and Bronze Age settlement systems in the
dry-farming zone of Syria and Iraq it is possible to examine the relationship between measured
archaeological land use zones and the size of central settlements. Beyond this, settlement-land use
models can be generated that show how settlement hierarchies and catchment production can rise
in tandem to replicate classic central-place type systems.

THE CALCHAQUI VALLEY
Inka-period settlements of the Calchaqui Valley exhibit two basic variations. The Inka sites Cortad-
eras and Corral Blanco contain a central compound of 19 structures, and passages, circular structures,
usnus, kallankas, and supporting walls. The architecture, which required no leveling or foundations,
consists of double-faced pirka with trimmed rocks, The site Guitian contains Santamariana and
purely Inka sectors. The first comprises semisubterranean conglomerate compounds with levelled
surfaces, and subrectangular compounds defined by vertically planted stones. Unlike the intrusive
Inka buildings, many santamariana structures have thick double exterior walls that form passages,
but exhibit no trimmed rock.

This paper focuses on relations between native residents of the Arctic coast and Euroamericans .
It examines the history of these relations and aspects of native culture that facilitated easy acceptance
of Euroamerican trade goods and other material culture. An existing native trade network and an
ideology that joined political power to control of material goods encouraged residents to enter into
interaction with the foreign culture with tragic results. In pursuing their perceived self interest,
natives willingly participated in a system of relations that led to the deaths of many and the near
destruction of the culture of those who remained.

Elaborate mortuary treatment including evisceration of bodies, replacement of limb bones with
vegetation, and the use of clay masks appears by 8000 B.P. in the coastal south-central Andes. The
varied mortuary treatment that characterizes the Chinchorro complex is well documented from
northem Chile, where extraordinary preservational conditions preserve mummies intact. In southem
Peru, preservation is not as good, but features such as position of burials, cemetery organization, and
tomb charactenstics are diagnostic of the Chinchorro complex. Indications of other characteristics,
including wrappings, buming, and other features, reveal the potential for studying Chinchorro burials
even when preservation is poor.

[77] TRADE AND SETTLEMENT GROWTH IN EARLY EUROPE

From the earliest appearance of permanent villages in Europe, trade between communities and
between regions is evident in the archaeological records. From the Early Iron Age on, trade was
extensive, and commerce played a major role in the development and growth of many communities.
Papers in this symposium present a series of case studies, from the Early lron Age into the medieval
period, that examine the role of trade in the establishment and expansion of settlements in early
Europe.

[86] TWO YEARS AFTER: REPATRIATION AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION

Two years after the enactment of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act
archacologists and museum personnel are confronted with the task of distinguishing the cultural
affiliation of human remains and associated funerary objects from a variety of contexts. In addition,
sacred objects and items of cultural patrimony are being identified in consultation with Native
American groups. This symposium brings together an array of individuals who are charged with
developing the regulations and guidelines to enact this procedure as well as others who are directly
affected by the evolving interpretations and practical implementation of these laws.

The evaluation of existing programs in archaeology designed to meet the needs of the educator

The Bir Tarfawi Basin in the Western Desert of Egypt offers an abundance of Middle Paleolithic
occupations geoarchacologically associated with the margins of three freshwater lakes between
175,000 and 70,000 years ago. These sites range from repeated rainy season occupations associated
with the harvesting of plant remains to a kill site in the dry season, The interpretation of spatial
and locational patterns at these sites reveal a high degree of variability both within and between
sites through time and space.

{101] PREHISTORIC WING TRAPS IN THE WESTERN GREAT BASIN
During the past seven years, various archaeological investigations in eastern California and Nevada
have documented the presence of numerous aboriginal wing traps, most of which were used to capture
deer or pronghorn during communal hunts. This presentation focuses upon four wing traps located
in the Mono Lake and Walker Lake drainages of east central California and west central Nevada,
respectively, and their roles within regional prehistoric cultural systems, as well as those of the
Great Basin as a whole,

Recent surveys in the Tuxtlas Mts. of Mexico have recovered a large sample of obsidian trom 180
archaeological sites. This paper reports on changes in source utilization, assemblage composition,
and technology from these samples during the Formative Period. Extant data indicate major changes
in reduction technology, with simple blades and flakes comprising most of the assemblage from
‘ Early and Middle Formative times and prismatic blades constituting the bulk of all materials from
all later time periods, which along with other shifts in utilitarian technology suggest changes in the
types of food resources consumed.

Sediments from a Medieval Farm site in Arctic Norway were characterized by the following
techniques: Particle-Size Distribution, X-Ray Diffraction, Organic Content, ph and Trace Element
Content. These techniques quantify the sediments allowing statistical comparison between different
cultural layers, The results demonstrate some correlations between layers and in some cases non-
correlations among individual layers. Implications for methods employed in the field.

Classic period Hohokam platform mound settlements have often been interpreted as community
centers for the circulation of information and economic resources. Evidence for localized craft produc-
tion, particularly of prestige goods, is one potential dimension of this function. This study presents
evidence for the centralized production and restricted distribution of shell ornaments in an Early
Classic platform mound community in the Tucson Basin. Data from comparable depositional contexts

[15] LICENSE TO LOOT

In order to curb the looting of archaeology sites, professional archaeologists need to be familiar
with the pothunters’ ever-changing techniques to gain access to sites and collections. A recent twist
on the old story is the proliferation of high quality mail order identification documents that declare
that the bearer is a member of such reputable societies as the American Association of Archaeologists.
This poster presents examples of these identifications with discussion.

[84] NORTHERN ILLINOIS PIPESTONE AND HOPEWELLIAN EXCHANGE SYSTEMS

“Pipestone” platform pipes recovered at Hopewellian sites in Illinois were assumed to have been
manufactured from kaolinitic flint clays of southern Ohio. However, recent X-ray diffraction analysis
of raw and finished Illinois “pipestone” artifacts demonstrate that they derive from a northwestern

Mitigative data recovery was conducted in 199] at a 7 km2 surtace lithic scatter on the Nevada
Test Site, Nye County, Nevada. About 95% of the assemblage of 5500 artifacts is lithic debris from
the reduction of low grade chalcedony nodules dispersed across the site. The remainder of the
collection includes cores, bifacial tools, and flake togls. Projectile points are dominated by Great
Basin Stemmed series and Pinto points. Two major patterns of land use are distinguished; an earlier
pattern suggestive of discard of expended items from a transported tool kit; and a later pattern of
opportunistic but exhaustive exploitation of meager lithic resources.

[54] ANASAZI POLITICAL ORGANIZATION

Anasazi political organization can be inferred through a regional synthesis of cultural variability,
the regional ceramic sequence, localized population densities, ahd community temporal, spacial, and
sequential development, This material reveals a single uniform cultural identity, and a unified
regional political system. The Chaco system served as the main physical manifestation of this Anasazi
regional political organization. Political organization, including management of the Chaco system,
appears to have been directed from an “Anasazi Heartland” extending from southwestern Colorado
to the San Juan River.

[101] ON THE IMPORTANCE OF BONE DENSITY IN STRUCTURING PREHISTORIC

SALMON BONE ASSEMBLAGES

Archaeologists working in the Pacific Northwest often suggest the low frequency of salmon cranial

elements and abundance of vertebrae in prehistoric deposits reflects the cultural use of stored fish.
|
, 156 Cantley, G.
While empirical documentation of salmon storage is certainly important, analysts must consider the
role of bone density in accounting for body part frequencies. Bone densities of representative cranial
and posteranial elements from 10 chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) skeletons were
measured using X-ray absorptiometry. The role of bone density in structuring prehistoric salmon
assemblages is explored through comparisons of density measures with element survivorships
obtained from several coastal and inland Plateau sites.

Recent excavations for the lroquois Pipeline Project have recovered maize and other subsistence
remains from multiple features at four different sites in the Mohawk, Hudson, and Housatonic

using Fourier Transform infrared spectrophotometry (FT-IR). The sample, originally believed to be
ground com, was found in a bow] which originated in the Balsas river region in the State of Michoacan,
Mexico. Although the original intent of the analyses was to rule out the presence of hallucinogenic
compounds such as Psilocybin (Psilocybe mexicana), Mescaline (Lophophora williamsii), Hyoscya-
mine and Scopolamine (Datura), characterization was accomplished when the spectral data of the

Although the Hudson Valley of New York is known to be rich in prehistoric lithic sources, few
quarries have been systematically documented. This presentation describes the results of extensive
excavations at the Hollister Lake Quarries, a central Hudson Valley chert source that was intensively
exploited from the Late Archaic to Middle Woodland periods. This work has provided important
insights into patterns of chert extraction and early-stage reduction strategies in the region. The
identification of an adjoining habitation area—rare for quarry sites—has also clarified the nature of
the position of the quarry within the larger settlement system.

[54] PROCUREMENT, PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF ARGILLITE ARTIFACTS: A
PRELIMINARY EXAMINATION OF SOUTHWESTERN INTERACTION SYSTEMS
Argillite is a soft, red, shale-like sediment, called pipestone or catlinite in the American Midwest.
It is particularly suitable for manufacture into small beads and pendants; recent evidence also suggests
that argillite was being used as a red pigment in prehistoric ceramic manufacture. X-ray diffraction
analysis of over 700 source area rocks and 150 argillite artifacts indicates that there are three major
source zones for argillite procurement in the American Southwest, Artifacts from these sources are
differentially distributed at sites throughout the Southwest. These data suggest the presence of
‘ multiple exchange spheres with one clearly dominant source.

[101] SALMONID BEHAVIOR AND RIVER MORPHOLOGY AS A MEANS OF PREDICTING
ARCHAEOLOGICAL FISHING SITE LOCATIONS
Research into prehistoric aboriginal fishing practices and locations has increased in importance as
native salmon runs decrease and controversy over the declining resource increases, particularly with
reference to Native American fishing rights. The Hanford Reach, of the Columbia River, provides a
study area where locations of archaeological fishing sites can be predicted based upon the behavior
of anadromous fish and the channel morphology. It is possible to determine the fishing method
employed at a site by establishing what the most efficient fishing method would be for a location,
and correlating that information with archaeological features and artifacts. This approach provides
a means of checking ethnographic information and verifying traditionally gathered archacological
data on fishing locations.

ancient mining operations. Ground stone tools are a prominent part of the surface artifact assemblage,
both inside and outside the mine. Evidence for domestic utilization of stone tools can also be found
at Goltepe and Kestel. Questions to be addressed will concern: type vs. function, residue analysis
and experimental duplication of stone tool ore processing.

[101] CLIMATIC VARIABILITY, RESOURCE PREDICTABILITY, PRODUCTION: A
CULTURAL-ECOLOGICAL BACKGROUND FOR THE LATE OCCUPATION OF THE
GREAT PLAINS

Arguing from a risk-minimization perspective, we consider the climatic hackground to the post-
AD 1600 aboriginal occupation of the Great Plains. Dendroclimatic reconstructions for fifteen stations
scattered over the Plains allow us to reconstruct year to year patterns in climatic conditions with
critical implications for horticulture and bison hunting. Although our data illuminate long-term
trends in climate, we focus particularly on the frequency and magnitude of severe periods of depriva-
tion as well as of beneficial conditions, which were probably more important determinants of human
adaptions. These data also outline the framework within which Contact Period forces disrupted
cultural-ecological relations in the region.

[101] COASTAL SITES IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON: HOW MANY OTHERS ARE BELOW SEA
LEVEL?

A site complex was discovered below contemporary sea level during construction at the METRO
sewage treatment plant in Seattle, Washington. Shell midden deposits, fire modified rock features,
buried soils, and a diverse assemblage of bone, antler, and lithic artifacts indicate this area of Puget
Sound coast was occupied intensively ca. 4,000 to 1,000 years ago. The landscape was lowered over
2 meters below present sea level by faulting during a large earthquake. Discovery of these sites below
sea level suggests many Southern Puget Sound littoral sites older than 1,100 BP are inundated.

‘ [84] EFFECTS OF CATASTROPHIC FLOODS OCCASIONED BY MISUSE OF THE LANDSCAPE

Maps and stratigraphic tests of a river bend locality illustrate widespread effects upon archaeological
site contexts. The Schoharie watershed of eastern New York serves to model geomorphic conditions
and historical circumstances that led to increases in severe flood frequencies, Landscape survey
encountered deposits in reverse stratigraphic sequence in regard to cultural chronology, while else-
where remains still in situ lay buried under unusually thick and/or coarse overburden. Fine overbank
sediments may have protected one site from subsequent high energy floods that emplaced sands and
gravels. This rare late Early Woodland occupation had microdrills that suggest connections to the
Middlesex mortuary complex.

[54] DEMOGRAPHIC, CLIMATIC AND SETTLEMENT PATTERN CHANGE AMONG THE

WESTERN ANASAZI BETWEEN AD 500-1250: A NEW ASSESSMENT OF SURVEY DATA

Preliminary survey data has been digitized with a Geographic Information System providing graphic
visualization of settlement data. This allows a rapid assessment of environmental variables and site
location. Survey was conducted in Southern Utah where little is known about the archaeology in
the region from AD 1100-1250. The focus was to place sites within their environmental! context for
analysis; environmental variables included elevation, soils, distance to water, and vegetation. Analysis
has shown a late P II and early P I Anasazi presence. Combining site location and environmental
renee is evidence of settlement pattern change in association with demographic and climatic

ctors.

Altithermal-age water wells are known from several sites on the southern High Plains, occurring
in abundance at the sites of Blackwater Locality No. | and Mustang Springs. In an effort to detect
other such sites, and test the utility of ground penetrating radar (GPR) in mapping the well features,
the technique was used at the Gibson Ranch site on Blackwater Draw, some 80 km downstream

[30] RAW MATERIAL ECONOMY IN THE LATE PALAEOLITHIC OF SOUTH-EAST ITALY
Traditional interpretations of the south-east Italian late Paleolithic assemblages stem from a rigid
typological stance and identify two separate industrial facies which coexisted in the region, distinct
in different phases of local evolution through the various stages of an epigravettian tradition. A
reanalysis of some of these assemblages by focusing on their technology fails to find evidence support:
ing such a model, and instead suggests that the relative costs of raw material procurement and
consequent strategies of tool production, use and maintenance were among the dominant factors
determining the observed inter-site assemblage variability.

and preparing bone for breakage to release marrow. In this study, cut mark distributions are compared
to well documented shifts in overall strategies of animal use, suggesting limits to the interpretability

type varies. The artifact form varies, but usually consists of some general bifacial form, either a flat
disk or crude thick biface. This range of variation is illustrated with examples from the Lllinois river

from the Crib cache, Indiana, and disks from Mound 2 of the Ohio Hopewell Mounds.

Statistical relationships between various heartwood and sapwood parameters in Pinus ponderosa,
Pinus edulis, Juniperus sp., and Psuedotsuga menziesii, may be used to estimate cutting dates for
dendrochronologica chronological specimens. When used in conjunction with other contextual infor-

[15] VARIATION OF EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE IN OBSIDIAN HYDRATION DATING
Implicit in the calculation of obsidian hydration dates is the premise that effective hydration
temperature |EHT) is constant in space and time, since only one effective hydration temperature—
and thus one rate of hydration—is used for cach artifact dated. To evaluate the validity of this
premise, a comparative study has been conducted at Pot Creek Pucblo in north-central New Mexico.
Several potential sources of variation in effective hydration temperature have been included in
this study: differing activation energies of the materials involved, changes in effective hydration
temperatures with depth, and changes in air temperature over long periods of time.

assemblage formation. Use life data from seven major and ten additional ethnoarchaeological sources
show that the directly measurable “primitive property’ of vessel size—in its various dimensions—
is positively related to use life. Results offer the provisional prospect of estimating use life of archaco-

The Waterfall Site, a multi-component campsite in the Town of Athens, New York was sporadically
occupied between the Late Archaic and Late Woodland periods. The most significant occupation,
attributable to the Sylvan Lake complex (2400 to 1900 B.C.}, is represented by Lamoka, Bare Island,
Wading River, and Narrow Stemmed points. Identification of activity areas and lithic analyses indicate
various activities occurred including hunting, biface reduction, and food preparation. Although Onon-
daga and Normanskill cherts dominate the debitage, Esopus chert, a local but rarely utilized material,
constitutes 9% of the assemblage. Site location, tool assemblage, and site function suggest the site
represents an unidentified type in the Sylvan Lake settlement system.

[30] THE HEIGHT OF BUILDINGS IN ANCIENT ROME: NEW ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA
How tall were the buildings of ancient Rome? The traditional view, based on the Roman ethnohist-

applied a “rule of thumb” relation predicting the height of buildings no longer extant from the
thickness of their ground floor foundation walls. Recently, archaeological data to test this relation
were gathered and analyzed on site in Rome, Pompeii, Ostia and Herculaneum. Results strongly
suggest that the rule of thumb relation is unreliable, leaving sufficient reason to question that
buildings were as high in ancient Rome as often gssumed.

Télatively autonomous class of intellectual and bureaucratic elite (literati). Confucian philosophy
legitimized power relations through control of the educational process and through advocation of

SEARCH FOR THE COLUMBUS CARAVELS AND AN ASSESSMENT OF 1000 YEARS OF
HUMAN LAND USE

Geoarchaeological investigations of St. Ann's Bay, Jamaica, show that the two caravels abandoned
by Christopher Columbus in A.D. 1504 are buried in the shallow bay muds immediately offshore of
the modern beach. Stratigraphic studies also show that there were two periods of rapid sedimentation

during the last 5000 years, one from A.D, 1000 to 1300 (lagoon filling) and the second between A.D.

1700 and modern times (bay filling). The prehistoric introduction of agriculture to Jamaica around

A.D. 900 and later European intensification of agriculture appear to be the cause of these two episodes

of increased sedimentation.

[30] THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF LARGE SCALE COPPER PRODUCTION IN PREHISTORIC
CENTRAL THAILAND

Five seasons of fieldwork by the Thailand Archaeometallurgy Project in Central Thailand has

revealed the presence of large scale copper production beginning around 1500 B.C. At ca. 700-500

B.C. during a period in Southeast Asia that saw increasing social complexity, production shifted from

small copper ingots and tools, to small socketed objects that appear to be projectile points. Current

data suggests that production was performed by numerous small groups of independent craft special-
ists rather than centralized production controlled by a larger political or economic entity. Some
evidence suggests contacts with coastal sites, and possibly to northern Vietnam.

[15] PROMOTING PUBLIC OWNERSHIP OF THE PAST
For many reasons it is essential that the public take an increasing role in the “ownership” of our
collective past. The Institute for Minnesota Archaeology has developed a three-part strategy for
public education programming. We involve the public through on-site tours, excavations, teachers
workshops, school presentations, and participation in site stewartship. We present our results by
brochures on individual sites and video’s on specific themes. We maintain continuity with our public
by stressing that archaeology is question driven and that our results generate new questions to answer.

, 10 [95] Emerging Complexity at the Maya Site of Kichpanha, Belize
[95] EMERGING COMPLEXITY AT THE MAYA SITE OF KICHPANHA, BELIZE
The excavations conducted at Kichpanha since 1985 have helped define the presence and influence
of an elite class at this site by the end of the Late Preclassic Period and continuing through the Early
Classic, The style and symbolism associated with these occupations are consistent with those noted
for many of the dominant sites in the Maya Lowlands, The papers presented in this symposium will
evaluate, using different data sets, the role of Kichpanha within the context of emerging social
and economic complexity. The further evaluation of Kichpanha will clarify how moderate-sized
communities participated and affected the development of complexity in the region.
[96] CURRENT PERSPECTIVES ON ILLINOIS ARCHAEOLOGY: THE NORTH SPEAKS FOR
ITSELF
Recent and extensive survey, in-depth testing, and full scale excavation of sites performed by a
number of universities and independent contractors in northern Illinois enable archaeologists to
generate a picture of prehistoric and protohistoric lifeways independent of culture histories built
upon research in central and southern Illinois. Research presented in these papers can now be used
in comparison with data from the other regions to address such questions as subsistence practices,
settlement location, and the role of material culture in the maintenance of social boundaries, as well
as to provide definition and clarification of temporal phases within the region.
[102] MOUNDVILLE REVISITED: A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION
The Moundville site in west-central Alabama—already one of the best known Mississippian cen-
ters—has been the focus of much additional research over the past decade. New information provokes
us to refine, to re-think, and in some cases to challenge previous interpretations concerning this
center and its satellite communities. Participants in this roundtable session will jointly take stock
of certain recent developments, will provide a mutual critique, and, looking ahead, will reflect on
the possibility of a revised synthesis.
[103] CHANGING PERSPECTIVES OF NAVAJO CULTURE; RECENT RESEARCH ON NAVAJO
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES
Navajo adaptation and culture history have been defined by anthropological-linguistic models,
limited historic documents, and sparse archaeological research for much of this century. Recent
research on Navajo sites, both inside and outside the current Navajo Nation boundaries, is changing
longheld assumptions about Navajo culture, history and adaptation. These new data are forcing us
to change our views of Navajo origins, interaction, land-use, and adaptation during the last five
centuries. The papers in this symposium discuss the material correlates of the changing role of the
Navajo in the Southwest f153, during the protohistoric, historic, and modern periods.
[104] THE EMERGENCE OF POTTERY
— This symposium brings together recent world-wide research on the appearance of pottery as a craft
and provides new perspectives on the nature of invention and adoption of pottery and ceramics
‘ manufacturing, Potting is closely tied to important developments in past socicties. The local emer-
gence of potting, in many cases rapid, was dynamic and followed different trajectories. Models of
pottery invention and adoption are now increasingly testable, particularly through technological and
archacometric research. These papers present a fresh set of individual perspectives on the central
phenomenon of the emergence of pottery from the Old and New Worlds.
{105] THE INKA EXPANSION INTO THE SOUTHERN ANDES: THE VIEW FROM THE
CALCHAQUI VALLEY, ARGENTINA
This symposium presents the 1990-92 Proyecto Arqueologico Calchagui's research into the effects
of Inka rule in the Calchaqui Valley, northwest Argentina. Participants discuss study of political
economy and settlement at Inka, Santamariana (local), and Inka-Santamariana settlements. Topics
include settlement patterns; site planning; architecture; and production and use of botanical, ceramic,
metal, and wealth materials in residential and ceremonial contexts. This region exhibited two patterns
of state-subject relations: segregated imperial occupation in the north and integrated state-local
settlement to the south. Patterning in material remains further reflects differential access to foods
and finished goods and segregated production activities at state and subject settlements.
[106] NEW DIRECTIONS IN AMERICAN BOTTOM ARCHAEOLOGY
Since the publication of the American Bottom Summary volume nearly a decade ago, additional
investigations have been undertaken in the American Bottom. This work has greatly expanded the
data base with respect to the environmental setting and the cultural sequence. While it is imperative
that a viable sequence be established, the ultimate goal is to delineate the dynamics that occur across
space and through time within the region known as the American Bottom. The various papers will
, [110] Old World Trade and Interaction 11
highlight the regional scope and implications of the work with continued refinement and clarification
of the culture-historical sequence.

[107] MICRO-ECONOMY, MIDDLE RANGE THEORY, AND THE HOHOKAM

Recent work in Arizona has produced valuable data on the micro-economy of Hohokam settlements.
Micro-economy here refers to the procurement and allocation of resources and the distribution of
activities within a site. Synthesis of these findings has lagged in relation to the formulation of higher
order interpretations dealing with relationships among Hohokam communities. This symposium
redresses this imbalance by presenting new interpretations from structures, activity areas, botanical
remains, and other artifacts. It does so in the context of middle range theory, that is, with reference
to rigorous frameworks for determining ‘‘what happened” at the site level.

[108] FINS, FEATHERS, FUR AND FIRE: NEW ALLIANCES IN THE U.S. FOREST SERVICE
HERITAGE RESOURCES PROGRAM

In response to public demand for sustainable land and resource management, the U.S. Forest
Service has established an ecologically-based, integrated resource policy. The heritage initiative, in
implementing the principles and aims of ecosystems management, is basically an effort to apply the
archeological! and historical principles of the discipline to practical purposes that are not in themselves
pure heritage resource research or compliance oriented. This symposium presents a variety of exam-
ples where archeological and historical data are being studied in an attempt to help resolve contempo-
rary natural resource issues facing National Forests.

[109] GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND THE ARCHAEOLOGIST: MAKING A DIFFERENCE
IN PUBLIC POLICY

Government policies at the federal, state, local and tribal level make a significant impact on the
way archacology is or is not done. Individuals, including archaeologists, have an important role to
play in effecting the outcome of public policy. Based on first hand experience, professionals will
discuss the trials, tribulations, and sometimes exultation of being directly involved in the lobbying
process. Experts will present case studies from local government, state government, tribal government
and federal government of how an archaeologist worked either to affect legislation or change govern-
ment regulations and policy. In addition several discussants will provide their perspective on the
effectiveness of such work.

[110] OLD WORLD TRADE AND INTERACTION IN THE FOURTH AND EARLY THIRD
MILLENNIA B.C.

In this symposium participants will discuss theoretical models and empirical data that have been
used to explain regional interaction in the Old World in the fourth and early third millennia B,C.
The areas under consideration will include Arabia, Egypt, Sinai, Palestine, Transjordan, Transcaucasia,
Mesopotamia and Elam. This symposium is intended to be interdisciplinary drawing on scholarship
trom many fields including Anthropology, Egyptology, Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations and
Syro-Palestinian Archaeology. 4
