pictures to convey information about the individuals and/or the events taking place, there
must be visual signals or cues that identify the individuals’ position in the socio-cultural
universe. These visual signals are usually found in items of dress, hair style, ornament, and
ethnic stereotypes. The symposim papers will be oriented around the application of the
socio-cultural framework to different art media in Mesoameria. Each paper will be
concerned mainly with 1 medium and 1 stylistic zone, They will deal with the socio-cultural
information obtainable on one or more level (individual, group, society). They will assess
how useful this approach is in the different media and how the results of analysis can aid in
a better understanding of the structure of Mesoamerican society.
(27) THE RISE AND FALL OF THE CENTRAL MEXICAN CLASSIC. A long-standing
topic of interest in Mesoamerican archaeology has been the elucidation of possible factors
involved in the rise and fall of Classic Maya civilization. Two recent contributions have
examined the subsistence base for Maya civilization in the light of marine resources and
both internal and external stresses which may have been involved in the collapse of the
Classic Maya civilization. By contrast, it would seem that little concentrated effort has been
expended toward careful examination of factors involved in the rise and fall of central
Mexican Classic civilization. The papers of this symposium will focus on the processes
involved in either the initial development of the central Mexican Classic or its collapse, as
seen from various geographical and cultural perspectives.
(28) SAMPLING IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Three general topics will be discussed during the
symposium: (1) theoretical and technical problems in the application of probabilistic
sampling to archaeological data, (2) sampling within a single site, and (3) sampling within
archaeological regions. The first topic includes papers that relate all aspects of archaeological
research and the nature of the archaeological record to the sampling of total populations.
Two technical papers discuss characteristics of populations and of samples and the nature of
archaeological research. The last 2 topics—sampling within the site and the region—have the
same format: an introductory paper(s) that attempts to bind the remaining case studies
together, The case studies are descriptive statements and self-criticisms of the sampling
experiences of the authors.
(31) CURRENT DIRECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARCHAEOLOGY. Prehistoric California
provides a laboratory for the study of social and cultural change among non-agriculturalists
in a varied and dynamic environment. This symposium attempts a broad overview of current
attempts to realize this potential, utilizing a diversity of theoretical, methodological, and
organizational approaches.
(42) PROBLEMS AND POSSIBILITIES OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD SCHOOLS.
Archaeological field schools are offered to provide training to students and to acauire
archaeological evidence. This symposium focuses on the problems in achieving these 2 goals.
Thestrategies and problems of field school programs and how they affect the achievement of
the dual goals are presented in the papers with a general discussion to follow.

, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS

Ackerman, Robert E.. A MACROCORE AND FLAKE INDUSTRY IN SOUTHEASTERN
ALASKA (CIRCA 8200-3700 B.P.). The Ground Hog Bay site #2 is 40 mi west of Juneau,
Alaska, The early occupation (Component Ili, 10,180+800 B.P.; 9,130£130 B-.P.) is
evidenced by few artifacts and remains enigmatic. The next occupation (Component Il,
82304130 B.P.; 37504100 B.P.) is well defined by a lithic assemblage which contains
microcores and microblades with a macrocore and flake industry. The upper cultural layer
(Component I, 345485 B.P. to circa 50 B.P.) is marked by a ground stone inventory with
split plank houses. The macrocore and flake industry of Component !! will be presented as a
further elucidation of the cultural inventory of the GHB 2 site. Specifically, attention will
be directed to the technological attributes of the two macrocores types—blade-flake cores,
and Levatiois cores. Finally, the association of the macrocore industry with the remainder of
the lithic assemblage from Component I! will be presented in the concluding part of the
paper with a tentative formulation of a lithic complex in Southeastern Alaska at this time
level. (7)

Adams, R. E. W., FINE ORANGE POTTERY AS A SOURCE OF ETHNOLOGICAL
INFORMATION. The Altar and Balancan (X and Z) groups of Fine Orange pottery yield
certain specific identifications of ethnic groups. These groups are thought to include the
makers, located on the Gulf of Mexico to the West of Laguna de Terminos, and more rarely,
people from the zone of classic Maya culture. Cultural and historical implications are
discussed. (22)

Adovasio, J. M., THE EVOLUTION OF BASKETRY IN PREHISTORIC MEXICO. Recent
analyses of some 2000 well dated specimens of coiled, twined, and plaited basketry have
provided the data necessary for a detailed reconstruction of the technical evolution of
basketry in prehistoric Mexico. The major aspects of this 9000 year developmental sequence
are discussed with special emphasis on the spread of Mexican techniques into the American
Southwest. (26)

Agenbroad, Larry D., THE HUDSON-MENG PALEO-INDIAN BISON KILL, N.W.
NEBRASKA: AN ANALYSIS AFTER TWO FIELD SEASONS. Excavations, test pits, and
backhoe trenching in the 1972 field season have ted to a better understanding of the site
occurrence and a tripling of its size and faunal estimate. Twelve artifacts of 2 paleo-point
styles were recovered from the bone bed. Lithic workshop areas have been identified and
new information on butchering techniques and faunal analysis have been derived, (38 A)
Aigner, Jean S., MULTIDISCIPLINARY TRAINING AND RESEARCH IN THE
ALEUTIAN ISLANDS, The current University of Connecticut multidisciplinary project in
the Aleutians has several major goals: research into human biocultural adaptation over time
to a rich, maritime ecosystem; biomedical and other studies which positively benefit the
Aleuts; and training of undergraduate and graduate students from various disciplines in
multidisciplinary research. The training aspect of the project is discussed here. The training
offered as part of the project makes use of a model research area in which recoverability of
information through multidisciplinary design and strategy is patent. The skills and
knowledge gained from this integrated approach serve as intellectual models for
participants regardiess of the geographic area and particular discipline in which they
concentrate their professional work. (42)

Aigner, Jean S., and Bruce Fullem, SANDY BEACH BAY, A 4300-5600 B.P. ALEUT
VILLAGE, The 1972 reconnaissance of southwestern Umnak led to the discovery of Sandy
Beach Bay, a large maritime village which has been located on a bay subsequently destroyed
by filling and uplift, Excavations revealed a 1000 year sequence of semi-subterranean houses
with rich representation of Aleut stone tool kits from each of 6 house floors and from roof
tops. Technological comparisons with both earlier Anangula (8400 B.P.) and later Chaluka
(4000 B.P.) Aleut base villages refiects the chronological intermediacy of Sandy Beach Bay.
Activity loci reconstructed from the remains indicate the nature of behavioral continuity in
Aleut villages spanning thousands of years in the same locale, and the magnitude of change in
the fabricational behavior attending stone tool manufacture. (38A)

Aigner, Jean S., and Douglas Veitre, UMQGAN BURIALS FROM SOUTHWESTERN
UMNAK ISLAND, ALASKA. The 1972 reconnaissance of southwestern Umnak Island led
to the discovery of some 50 features identified by the Aleuts as root storage facilities. Upon
excavation these umaan proved to be structures for the interment of both adult and young
Aleuts. Usually removed from habitation sites and occurring in clusters on hillsides
overlooking water, Uumdan burials reinforce patterns noted by both the early Russian
observers and later demographers; birth, stillbirth, and abortion were reported to the Aleut
community, as well as the death of adolescents and adults. It would appear further that the
value of all individuals as community members, both realized and potential, is reflected in
the care and considerable effort invested in the umaqan pattern of burial. (7)

, Ames, Kenneth M., CULTURAL STABILITY ON THE NORTHWEST COAST. Results of
recent archaeological excavations in the Prince Rupert Harbor region of British Columbia
suggest that the area has been culturally stable for almost 5000 yr. This stability is based
upon the evolution of an efficient adaptation to a highly variable, high diversity environment.
The efficiency of the adaptation required a complex interplay between technology, social
organization, and population density. (37)
Ammerman, A. J., and L. L. Cavalli-Sforza, A SIMULATION STUDY OF BANDKERAMIK
SETTLEMENT PATTERNS, This simulation study represents an attempt to explore the
relationships between some of the main factors involved In the formation of Bandkeramik
settlement patterns. Particular attention is paid to the roles that population growth and
local migratory activity may have played in the spread of the Bandkeramik and in
determining patterns of settlement. Simulation results and archaeological evidence can be
evaluated in the light of one another. Some comments are made on the reformulation of
certain Bandkermik interpretations and questions. (24)
Asch, David L., SOME PROBLEMS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SAMPLING. A number of
problems in the sampling of archaeological sites will be discussed. Effective sample sizes are
often small for the purposes of statistical description and analysis, even when large
quantities of cultural material have been excavated. Several reasons for this are enumerated,
and effects upon sample reliability are discussed. For the solution of certain kinds of
archaeological problems it is difficult to design suitable probabilistic samples. For instance,
spatial structure is particularly difficult to investigate using probability techniques. Several
issues are raised in the application of analytical, as opposed to descriptive, statistics to
archaeological samples because of spatial autocorrelation in the data and because complex
sampling designs must often be used. (28)
Ayres, James E., BEEF AND BOOZE |: DEMOGRAPHY OF FOOD CONSUMPTION IN
AN URBAN ENVIRONMENT, 1870-1900. This project is designed to compare the effects of
ethnic background and relative household economic level on the long-term patterns of meat
and liquor consumption in the American diet. Relative economic level is determined from
trash recovered by the Tucson Urban Renewal Project. Property ownership records are
examined for ethnic background information. The effects of ethnicity (Chinese, Anglo, and
Mexican-American) and economic status on consumption of these 2 necessities is examined
over a30 yr period (1870-1900) in Tucson, Arizona. (9)
Barbour, Warren, THE ROLE OF RELIGION IN THE FALL OF TEOTIHUACAN. There is
evidence supporting a great amount of religious continuity from Metepec into Oztoticpac
and Coyotlateico. A certain complex of figurines, including throned figurines and a possible
Earth Goddess, continues, while another complex, including portraits and cylindrical body
figurines, is discontinued or radically changed. The religious implication of strong continuity
into Coyotlateico-Xometia times will be discussed. (27)
Baron, Aileen G., RADIOCARBON DATES FROM THE PALESTINE AREA. Although a
number of radiocarbon measurements are available for the Palestine area, some anomalous
dates, particularly from the Neolithic period, and discrepancies between Bronze Age
radiocarbon and expected dates have distorted interpretations of the kind of information
that can be gained from radiocarbon dating. Application of the Bristlecone Pine sequence
for calibration of dates prior to 5200 B.C. indicates a closer agreement between historically
related and radiocarbon dates. This paper presents a review of extant radiocarbon dates for
the Seton area, and discusses the significance of radiocarbon measurements from the area
for archaéologicai interpretation. (25)
Bates, Daniel G., PRODUCTION AND POPULATION AMONG NOMADIC HERDERS.
This paper discusses the correlates of productivity in animals, labor, and family size for a
nomadic pastoral population. Specifically, the analysis indicates the strong relationships
between herd size and family size, between herd size and the demands of consumption
within the household, and between the intensity of production (worker output) and
demands of consumption, This concern with variables related to production is relevant to an
understanding of significant aspects of nomadic pastoral adaptation, including demographic
processes. These variables are also essential to models which purport to show the
interactions of such populations with populations in other modes of production. (1)
Benfer, Alice, A PRELIMINARY LITHIC ANALYSIS OF OBSIDIAN FROM PRE-
HISTORIC TULA. Obsidian is the second most numerous class of artifacts recovered from
the 1970-72 excavations of Tula—the capital of the Postclassic Toltec state. Aspects of the
lithic analysis include: (1) a multivariate analysis of a sample of prismatic bDiades to
determine nonredundant attributes for different phases of lithic analysis (i.e., blade
production technology, stylistic variation, wear pattern studies); (2) discussion of core
preparation and blade production methods; and (3) the use of neutron activation and other
methods to examine intrasite variation in the use of raw materials. (38)
Benfer, Robert A,, ITERATIVE DETECTION OF CASE AND VARIABLE REDUN-
DANCY IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SAMPLES. Two major problems of anthropological
sampling are the adequate definition of a universe and the detection of redundancy within
samples. The following procedures are suggested as a method for discovery of case and
20
, :

I
variable redundancy by iteration: (1) preliminary principal components analysis of the data
to create new, uncorrelated variables (components), although decorrelation may be
inefficient since among and within groups variance Is not distinguished; (2) cluster analysis
of components to produce relatively homogeneous groups with respect to the components;
(3) canonical variate analysis of the grouped data to create another new set of variables
(canonical variables) that are uncorrelated within the groups; (4) cluster” analysis of
canonical scores to remove additional case redundancy; (5) steps (3) and (4) are repeated
until group membership does not change further. The final results aré groups very
homogeneous (redundant) for variables that are very independent (non-redundant) for the
groups. The technique is illustrated using materials from the archaeological site of Tula,
Hidalgo, Mexico. (28)
Bennett, M. Ann, FORMAL INSTRUCTION IN CERAMIC ANALYSIS. Pottery is a major
concern of professional archaeologists and, accordingly, constitutes a ‘‘subject’’ that must
somehow be taught to students. The usual means of instruction is, quite literally, an
apprenticeship—a supervised learn-by-doing situation. At ENMU a different, if not alto-
gether unique, approach Is being taken—that of formal classroom instruction in ceramic
analysis. Lectures, reading assignments and practical laboratory exercises are combined to
give students a firsthand acquaintance with the wide range of analytical techniques
applicable to the study of ceramics. This paper describes our present program, and the pros
and cons of its formalized, comprehensive approach. (42)
Berger, Edward, SIMULATION IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES. This paper examines the
general role of simulation in the social sciences. Since the author is a political scientist, It
focuses on the Interdisciplinary areas of simulation experiments for social policy making and
the development of social science theory. (24)
Bettarel, Robert, and Ronald Schwartz, DEMOGRAPHY AND EARLY MAN IN THE
AMERICAS: A COMPUTER SIMULATION MODEL OF POPULATION GROWTH AND
DISPERSAL RELATING TO MAN’S ENTRY INTO THE AMERICAS, In this paper we
attempt to estimate the time required for an initial group of migrants to completely
populate the area of North America. The problem is briefly outlined and current estimates
of the time of man’s entry into the New World are identified. A model of population growth
and dispersal is then run using different sets of values and an estimate is made of the time
required to fully populate the continent. By using different sets of values we attempt to
bracket the time of entry and minimal and maximal estimates of the time required to fill the
area are formulated. These estimates are then used to argue for one of the alternate dates of
entry. A test of the model is offered, followed by a discussion of the advantages and
disadvantages of this technique for problems of this type. (24)
Bettinger, R. L., SETTLEMENT CHANGE AND STABILITY IN EASTERN CALI-
FORNIA: A DISCUSSION OF THE PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE OWENS
VALLEY PROJECT. Recent investigations in the Great Basin have reached certain
conciusions regarding questions of environmental change and the application of eth-
nographic models in archaeological contexts. |n order to further test the conclusions of
some of these studies, the Owens Valley Project has devised a set of field expectations based
on existing archaeological, ethnographic, and climatological information. These propositions
were initially tested during a 1972 summer field season. Problems of sampling and field
technique as well as preliminary results are discussed. (31)
Bickel, Polly, Thomas Jackson, and Thomas King, RISING SEA LEVELS ALONG THE
CALIFORNIA COAST: A PRELIMINARY CONSIDERATION OF SOME POSSIBLE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES. Approximate California coastlines circa 10,000,
7000, and 5000 yr before present are plotted on the basis of currently available geological
data. The effects of such shorelines on the distribution and adaptive poses of California
populations is considered. (37)
Binford, Lou, MINIMAXING LABOR IN RESPONSE TO STRESS. (8)
Birrell, Verla, SEVEN INDEPENDENT ASPECTS OF COLOR. Color has become an
ever-increasing source of general interest and of investigation by scientists, artists, and
designers since Newton discovered that white light can be broken by a prism into its
constituent rays of rainbow-tinted sequential hues. The recent interest of anthropologists
and archaeologists in the cultural associations of color identification and designation is only
one of 7 aspects of color which will be discussed. (26)
Biack, Robert F., LATE QUATERNARY GEOMORPHIC EVENTS RELATED TO PALEO-
ALEUTS, UMNAK ISLAND, ALASKA. Geologic studies during 5 field seasons permit
reconstruction of late Quaternary geomorphic events and their correlation using radio-
carbon-dated ash and soil sequences. An ice cap about 600 m thick covered Umnak Platform
until about 11,000 yr ago. Eustatic rise of sea level and isostatic rebound of the platform
canceled each other about 8000-3000 yr ago resulting in sea-level stability at about plus 3 m
and in rapid lateral coastal erosion of strand flats and rocky shoals. As eustatic rise
diminished, isostatic rebound towered sea level to its present position. A catastrophic
eruption of Okmok Volcano about 8000 yr ago is considered the most likely cause for
abandonment of Ananguia which survived marine erosion by fortuitous rock formations

21
, and deep water. Some younger sites of Paleo-Aleuts were on bays now filled and on islands
now joined to Umnak Island by infilling. Other sites are being eroded. A Neoglaciation
about 3000 yr ago had little direct effect on the people. (7)
Blanton, Richard, A SYSTEMIC APPROACH TO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN
POPULATION GROWTH AND SOCIO-CULTURAL CHANGE, Some theoretical ap-
proaches to the explanation of socio-cultural change attribute key causal significance to
populational growth and population pressure. In particular, increase in population size and
density has often been used to explain the intensification of cultivation. But what explains
the increase in population size and density? tn this paper some of the inconsistencies in this
approach are pointed out and the application of a systemic causal framework is suggested.
Population variables seem to be better examined in the context of an ecosystem within
which they are functionally interrelated with a number of other variables. This theoretical
framework permits us to examine population growth in terms of the system's “‘mechanisms”
operating on this variable and thus look at socio-cultural change as a process involving a
number of related factors. In addition, | will point out some of the problems involved, when
using limited archaeological data, in determining whether changes in population variables
were independent, or whether such changes were dependent upon changes of other
ecosystem variables. (1)
Blanton, Richard E., and Dudley P. Varner, THE RISE AND DECLINE OF THE CLASSIC
IN THE VALLEY OF OAXACA. Recent systematic, intensive surveys of Monte Alban and
the Etla (north) arm of the Valiey of Oaxaca allow detailed comparisons of this region with
the Valley of Mexico in terms of demographic shifts and settlement pattern shifts during
those periods pertaining to the rise and fall of the Classic. While the Monte Alban urban
complex is in many respects quantitatively and qualitatively unlike Teotihuacan, certain
similarities exist regarding the impact of the growth and decline of these centers on
populations in their sustaining areas. (27)
Bolian, Charles, FINCA RIVERA: A POLYCHROME SITE IN THE TRAPECIO OF
AMAZONAS, COLOMBIA, Excavations at Finca Rivera in the Trapecio of Amazonas
revealed that the carriers of the Polychrome tradition had reached this section of the
Amazon Basin by A.D. 1030. The ceramics from the site are of the Miracanguera
sub-tradition and appear to be closely related to the Napo complex of eastern Ecuador and
the Caimito complex of eastern Peru. if these ceramics represent the ancestors of the
historic Omagua or the historic Cocama, Tupian-speakers had migrated into this area earlier
than previously proposed. The Carbon-14 dates from Finca Rivera suggest that the presence
of Polychrome ceramics in this section of the Amazon Basin are the result of an upstream
migration. (30)
Briuer, Frederick L.. ASTUDY OF NATURAL AND CULTURAL REFUSE IN NORTH-
EASTERN ARIZONA ROCK SHELTERS, The excavation of both cultural and non-cultural
rock shelters in Chevelon canyon near Heber, Arizona, has yielded data usefu! in testing
propositions of interest to archaeologists. Dry cave preservation presents an opportunity to
investigate both natural and cultural depositional processes as well as Questions concerning
prehistoric activities and seasonality. The interrelatedness of these questions gives a focus
for directing the methodological and analytical considerations in this research. (33)
Brockington, Donald L., THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CLASSIC ON THE OAXACA
COAST. Archaeological Knowledge of the Oaxaca coast is based on our quick surveys and
on small-scale tests in 13 sites. While study is not finished, preliminary conclusions are in
agreement. It appears that styles and techniques typical of the late Preclassic persisted into
late Classic times and there seems to have been a low level of socio-cultural integration
during the Classic. While there is evidence of trade and contact with surrounding regions, it
would appear that coast peoples did not possess many of the characteristics usually taken to
define ‘‘Classic."' Several suggestions are given to help explain their apparent failure. (27)
Brooks, Richard H., and Sheilagh T. Brooks, EXCAVATION BY REQUEST: ARCHAE-
OLOGICAL RECOVERY OF PIONEER BURIALS. Expansion of the parking facilities of a
town mortuary necessitated the removal of the cemetery of a Las Vegas, Nevada, pioneer
family. Prior bulldozing of the surface of the cemetery and removal of the grave markers
had stripped all indication of the graves. The archaeological problem was to locate the graves
and identify the burials with the historical surface evidence destroyed. Employing a backhoe
as an adjunct to archaeological techniques, 4 burials and a cernent sepulcher were exposed,
photographed, and recorded. Identification of the skeletons by a physical anthropologist
enabled the confirmation of their historical relationships. (29)
Browman, David L., ECONOMIC INTERACTION OF THE EARLY HORIZON JAUJA-
HUANCAYO POLITY. Events reflected in the microcosm of the Jauja-Huancayo basin
suggest a reevaluation of the concept of a general pan-Peruvian Chavin Horizon. During the
late Initial Period and first 3 epochs of the Early Horizon, the Jauja-Huancayo area was
outside the Chavin orbit, participating minimally in local highland exchange networks. The
religious bifurcation in Chavin ideology that occurred roughly in Early Horizon Epoch 4 is
reflected by marked concurrent changes in the Jauja-Huancayo economic interaction sphere,
particularly in the copper trade. Ceremonial and religious practices associated with Chavin
22
, first appear in Early Horizon Epoch &, in terms of a reformed Paracoid variant of the Chavin
cult which sweeps the altiplano and puna at this time. (32)
Brown, James A., AN APPLICATION OF A SPECIALIZED DATA BANK FOR ANALYSIS
AND INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THE FIELD. This paper describes a computerized
data processing and information retrieval system specifically designed to meet the informa-
tion requirements of a large-scale archaeological investigation at the Koster site, a deep
stratified Archaic site in southern Illinois. The purpose of the system is to make up a
deficiency present in most large-scale programs by: (1) offering an efficient means of
expediting data analysis and (2) providing feedback during the course of excavation that
affects field decision making, student instruction and sampling procedures. The on-site use
of a remote terminal is the key element in the success of the system. The data bank is
restricted to accumulating specific classes of debris that provide quickly attainable means of
discovering the type and intensity of occupation through statistical analysis. (3)
Brown, James, A., DEEP SITE EXCAVATION STRATEGY AS ASAMPLING PROBLEM,
Although the problem of sampling deeply buried strata has occupied the attention of
archaeologists for some time, the increasing dependency on explicit sampling procedures
generated from a sampling model in archaeology today makes the use of information from
deep site excavations much more difficult. It is obvious that investigations of deeply buried
occupations are more often a direct projection of the excavation strategy of the uppermost
strata than they are specific to any of the lower. Although the sampling problems are
immense, this paper suggests a model and appropriate procedures that can help overcome
and compensate for some of this problem. This model is the product of experience with
applying a computerized on-site data processing system to the excavation of the Koster site,
a deeply buried, multi-component open-air site in southern tMlinois. (28)
Brown, Margaret Kimball, THE APPLICATION OF A GENERAL SYSTEMS MODEL TO
THE STUDY OF CULTURE CHANGE. The changes which occurred in the culture of
indian tribes from European contact generally have been considered by ethnohistorical
studies which have used a linear model of causation. Such models can be shown to be too
simplistic for the complex network of interrelationships found in any culture, and not
capable of use for generalization. A model based on general systems theory is considered
more useful since it enables the consideration of a large number of variables and allows for
identification of the significant variables of change. Such a model was utilized for a study of
the tilinois indians. The Iilinois in the seventeenth century were a large and powerful group,
but by the time they moved to a reservation in the 1830's numbered about 200 persons. The
model has produced coherent explanations for the changes which took place in the culture
and demonstrates the utility of the application of general systems theory to cultural change.

Brown, R. B., A BRIEF SURVEY OF EASTERN GUANAJUATO. The archaeological
knowledge of Guanajuato is very sketchy. In the United States it is best Known through the
salvage work of Muriel Porter at Chapicuaro in the fifties. More recently there has been
work by Columbia in the south of the state, |.N.A.H. and Stanford in the west, and |.N.A.H.
in the north and east. As a graduate student at the University of the Americas, R. B. Brown
has carried out a site survey in the eastern part of the state, The report will be divided into 4
sections: (1) location, description, climate, etc., of area—(a) considerations of climatic
change, and (b) site location; (2) summary of antecedents with special attention to the
chronology developed by 1!.N.A.H.; (3) description of major architectural features of
ceremonial centers; (4) analysis and dating of architectural features. (43)
Bruhins, Karen Olsen, ABSOLUTE DATES FOR THE QUIMBAYA CULTURE OF
CENTRAL COLOMBIA. Archaeological survey and tomb excavation in the Cordillera
Central (Depts. of Quindio and Valle) of Colombia has led to the formulation of a cultural
sequence for the late prehistoric period. Remains of 2 major subgroups of the material
popularly called Quimbaya were recovered and distribution of these 2 groups was plotted.
Although the historic component has yet to be identified there is now proof that neither of
these 2 cultural complexes pertain to the historical Quimbaya tribe, Instead, there is
evidence of a heavy population with a single culture spreading from just north of Buga in
Valle to, perhaps, Southern Antioquia dating to about A.D. 800-1200 with a rather drastic
depopulation of the entire area some 150 yr before the Spanish Conquest. This may be tied
to unsettied conditions during late prehistory and the movement of populations up and
down the Cauca drainage, one of which migratory groups was the Quimbaya. (45)
Bullen, Ripley P., THE TOCOBAGA INDIANS AND THE SAFETY HARBOR CULTURE,
Ortiz, tost from the Narvaez expedition of 1528 and rescued by De Soto in 1539; De Soto's
chroniclers; Fontaneda, a slave of the Indians for 17 yr; and Menendez, who visited the
Tocobaga in 1567, give us glimpses of sixteenth century life around Tampa Bay. It is
generally believed that the Safety Harbor site on Old Tampa Bay is the main town of the
Tocobaga, the one visited by Menendez. Archaeology has given us many data that define the
Safety Harbor cultural area, support the belief that the Safety Harbor site is Menendez's
Tocobaga, and agree with other clues gleaned from these sources. (19)
Burger, Marjorie K., THE |ROQUOIS OF THE ST. LAWRENCE VALLEY PROBLEMS OF
TRIBAL IDENTIFICATION AND DISAPPEARANCE, Jacques Cartier was the first
23
, European to explore the St. Lawrence River and leave any substantial record. Among his
accounts, collected between 1534 and 1541, are ethnographic descriptions and vocabulary
lists relating to a group since Identified as |roquoian, but which particular |roquoian group
has vexed historians, linguists, and archaeologists for over a century. In 1603 Champlain
entered the St. Lawrence area and found no trace of Cartier’s !troquolan speakers.
Algonquian-speaking Indians then inhabiting the area reported that the earlier indians had
withdrawn to the interior. Research during the last 6 yr has shown that the Indians met by
Cartier were not members of any of the historically known troquoian groups, but represent
a hitherto unrecognized troquoian group which developed in situ in the St. Lawrence area.
Shortly after 1541, when Cartier last saw them, this group left the St. Lawrence area and
was absorbed by the Huron. (44)
Butler, B. W., LATE GLACIAL AND POSTGLACIAL FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CARRY-
ING CAPACITY OF THE SAGEBRUSH-GRASS REGION OF EASTERN IDAHO. The
carrying capacity of the sagebrush-grass region of eastern Idaho as revealed in ow! pellet
remains at 2 cave sites on the Eastern Snake River Plain has varied considerably over the
past 15,000 yr. From 15,000 to 7000 yr ago, there was a continual but markedly
fluctuating increase in the carrying capacity of the region. At approximately 7000 yr ago,
there was an abrupt decline in the carrying capacity of the region and it has remained at a
relatively low level ever since. These changes in carrying capacity can be attributed to
climatic events associated with the late Pleistocene deglacial hemicycle and the onset of a
postglacial climatic regime. (4)
Callan, Dennis, SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN HAWAIIAN VALLEY ENVIRONMENTS.
Settlement patterns in 4 Hawaiian valleys are compared in terms of residence locations and
distribution of agricultural systems. In particular, the archaeological basis for making
statements about political contro! and social stratification is considered. (10)
Campbell, John M., AN EXPLANATION OF PREHISTORIC POPULATION SIZES AND
DENSITIES IN INTERIOR ALASKA AND THE YUKON. Late aboriginal and early historic
human communities in the interior far northwest were uniformly small, and population
densities were low. However, normal numbers of food species were sufficient to support
larger communities and higher densities. The archaeology and paleontology imply that these
several conditions also existed in the more distant past. Ethnographic studies among the
Nunamiut Eskimos, and the Tanana, Atna, and Tutchone Indians fail to establish that social
or social-environmental variables (i.e., religious restrictions, subsistence scheduling, warfare,
infanticide, contraception, abortion, sexual avoidance, etc.) were the root causes of the
widely shared human population characteristics noted. On the contrary, it appears that the
peculiar and fascinating phenomenon of synchronic oscillations of populations of quite
different vertebrate food species was the single, critical limiting factor. This conclusion is
explained, and a prehistoric analogue is suggested. (41)
Cassidy, Claire Monod, NUTRITIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HUNTING GATHER-
ING AND SETTLED AGRICULTURAL POPULATIONS IN THE EASTERN WOODLAND
REGION OF NORTH AMERICA. Nutrition and general health were studied, using 6
techniques of skeletal analysis, in two Amerindian archaeological populations—indian Knoll
(Archaic, western Kentucky, hunter-gatherer) and Hardin Village (Fort Ancient, eastern
Kentucky, agricultural fhorticulturail). Results of the skeletal analysis indicate that the
hunter-gatherers were healthier and suffered far less from majtnutrition than the agricul-
turalists, with other variables controlled archaeologically. implications: (1) Contrary to
commogp assumption, presence of a stable food supply, alone, does not ensure good
nutrition or health—dquality rather than quantity is pivotal. (2) Population growth, often
identified as a sign of the ecologically well-adapted group may lead to over-hunting of the
available game in horticultural groups. Quality protein intake then may fall, the overall
dietary balance suffer, and malnutrition, with all its consequences (e.g., deficient growth,
lack of resistance to infectious disease) become more common. (1)
Casteel, Richard W., ASSESSMENT OF LIVE WEIGHT AND MINIMUM NUMBER OF
INDIVIDUALS OF FISHES FOUND IN THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONTEXT. Since the
mid-1950"s a number of investigators have attempted to represent the remains of vertebrates
by means of their potential dietary contribution. This paper examines, in detail, this
approach as applied to the remains of fishes in the archaeological context. Methods for the
accurate prediction of tive weights are presented along with a method for utilizing the
information for assessment of the minimum number of individuals (MNI) represented in
fish-faunal assemblages. (33)
Castillo-Tejero, Noemi, THE SO-CALLED “MIXTEC POLYCHROME" WARE !IS NOT A
MIXTEC PRODUCT. Based on recent studies of the Oaxaca, Puebla, and Tlaxcala areas,
including surface findings but also different explorations, we believe we can prove that the
polychrome ware commonly calied *“‘mixtec,"’ is not actually a product of the mixtec people
but of their neighbors, those of the Puebla, Tlaxcala, area as Noguera proposed 20 yr ago.

Chariton, Thomas H., THE IMPLICATIONS OF POST-CONQUEST ARCHAEOLOGY FOR
METHOD AND THEORY iN PRE-CONQUEST RESEARCH IN THE VALLEY OF
MEXICO. During the last 2 decades there have been significant accurnulations of surface
24
, survey settiement pattern data for the pre-Conquest period in the Valley of Mexico. With a
few exceptions, the conceptual frameworks underlying both data recovery and data
interpretation have not developed in sophistication. From studies of the continuing
archaeological record in the Teotihuacan Valley (A.D. 1400-1969), | suggest several
procedures whereby the theoretical framework of pre-Conquest archaeological studies may
be elaborated and strengthened. (35)
Cheek, Charles 0., THE STUDY OF NARRATIVE SCENES IN MESOAMERICAN
ART—AN OLMEC EXAMPLE. An introduction is given to the strategy of using narrative
scenes in Mesoamerican art as a means to reconstruct details of the socio-cultural system of
a particular culture. It is assumed that the scenes are meant to communicate information
and that they can be interpreted by reference to their internal structure and through
comparison with other scenes of the same cultural and temporal period. Using Oimec
sculpture, example is given which attempts to explain the differences and similarities among
individuals portrayed in scenes within a socio-political framework, (22)
Chenhall, Robert G., A RATIONALE FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL SAMPLING. There are
several areas of archaeological fieldwork and laboratory analysis where sampling techniques
appear to offer the possibility of saving time without significant loss of information. Some
of the possible applications of sampling are: in the location of sites, in the selection of
surface artifacts found at sites, in the selection of sites to be excavated, in the selection of
portions of a site for excavation, and in the analysis of artifact collections. Each of these
possible applications is examined, first, to determine what the theoretical total population
might be in a typical or model research project and, second, to determine the natural and
cultural variables that intervene to make it difficult or impossible to estimate that total
population from the extant archaeological record, (28)

changes in domestic group size through time at Grasshopper, a fourteenth century pueblo
community in east-central Arizona. Aggregation and environmental stress are discussed as
possible explanations for these trends. Comparisons are made with specific aspects of

Clewett, Ed, A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON AN EARLY ARCHAIC SITE IN NORTH-
ERN CALIFORNIA. 4-Sha5258 is a site located in the foothills of the Northern
Sacramento Valley of California on Squaw Creek, a tributary to the Pit River. It seems to
offer a stratified correlation between an early archaic adaptation (Carbon-14 653027300 yr)
and the introduction of a Late Horizon complex similar to that used by the protohistoric
Wintu. (7)
Clewlow, C. William, Jr., PALEO-INDIAN PREHISTORY AND THE ORIGIN OF LAN-
GUAGE. A recent revival in interest centering on the origin of language has raised the
possibility that it could have arisen as recently as 35,000 yr ago. At the same time, the date
of man's antiquity in the New World has been steadily pushed backward. The possibility
looms that some humans were present in the New World prior to the origin of language.
Evidence for this supposition is examined, and new theoretical paradigms for understanding
of the “pre-projectile point’’ phase are offered. (17)
Collins, Michael B., ETHNOGRAPHY AND EXPERIMENTATION IN THE STUDY OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL LITHIC DEBITAGE, Ethnographic description and experimental
data provide the basis for establishing etic technological possibilities and principles to be
used in the interpretation of any emic technological system represented by material remains.
Three important principles emerge: (1) debitage is more dependable than finished objects in
the determination of past manufacturing procedures; (2) that a given form can be replicated
is not proof that the manufacturing procedures have been replicated; (3) ethnographic
descriptions are not reliable until verified experimentally. (2)
Collins, Michael B., THE SOURCES OF BIAS IN PROCESSUAL DATA: AN APPRAISAL.
A fundamental premise in processual archaeological research holds that human behavior isa
patterned part of a system with cultural, social, political, and environmental components. It
is necessary to be aware of the possible sources of bias which may intervene between the
fact of patterned human behavior and the discernment of pattern by the archaeologist. In
this appraisal, 7 such sources are identified and discussed using ethnographic and archaeolog-
ical examples: (1) not all behavior patterns result jn patterned material culture; (2) of those
which do, not all will occur where there is an opportunity for inclusion in archaeological
context; (3) of those which do so occur, not all will be included in such context; (4) of
those which are included, not all will be preserved; (5) of those which are preserved initially,
not all will survive; (6) of those surviving, not all will be exposed to—or by—the
archaeologist; and (7) among patterns exposed to the archaeologist, not all will be perceived
or properly identified. Coping with these potential sources of bias is a major responsibility
of the archaeologist. (28)
Connor, Judith G., and William L. Rathje, MASS PRODUCTION AND THE ANCIENT
MAYA: EXPERIMENTS IN CRACKING MAYA POTS. Since the pioneering work of
25
, Shepard (1965), little attention has been paid to comprehensive analyses of the physical
properties of prehistoric ceramics. One of the reasons for this neglect is that problems have
not been formulated for which such data are relevant. The problem of the spectacular
demographic restructuring within the Maya lowlands (ca. A.D. 800-900) between the Classic
and Postclassic periods provides an opportunity to systematically apply technolosical
analyses to better understand the past. A set of hypotheses have recently been developed
which relate this restructuring to changes in economic production and distribution systems.
One implication of these hypotheses is that Fine Orange and Fine Gray were mass-produced.
This paper presents the results of a preliminary exploration of a research design to evaluate
this implication. (21)

Cook, Thomas Genn, STRUCTURAL COMPARISON OF ARTIFACT COLLECTIONS:
THE DISCOVERY OF BEHAVIOR SETS WITHIN SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS. The mean-
ingful interpretation of subsistence-settlement systems hinges on first discovering the
behavior set or sets underlying particular artifact assemblages and then examining the
distribution of these behavior sets across the landscape. If we assume that the presence or
absence of combinations of tools reflects the performance of tasks at a number of sites, then
sét theory provides us a precise mathematical and logical framework to discover task-specific
tool kits. The assignment of specific tasks to these combinations of tool types can then be
tested with other, independent data (e.9., environmental evidence, food remains, features,
etc.) at each site under study. Paleo-Indian and Archaic examples will be used. (26)

Cordell, Linda S., SIMULATING WETHERILL MESA SETTLEMENT PATTERN
CHANGES: A DISCUSSION OF GENERAL IMPLICATIONS. The results of 3 computer
simulations that attempted to predict changes in location of settlements which occurred at
Wetherill Mesa, Colorado, between A.D. 700 and A.D. 1300 are briefly presented. Problems
of a general nature arising from a comparison of the results are discussed. These problems
include the choice of models for simulation, the necessity of replicating simulations which
include random variables, and difficulties in assessing the relative success of a simulation
experiment. It is argued that simulations of a variety of archaeological problems may be
useful and that the precision required by simulation is in itself an aid to research, but that
the archaeologist should be aware of possible sources of error in interpreting simulation
results. (24)

Crumley, Carole L., CELTIC SOCIAL STRUCTURE: AN EXERCISE IN PALEO-
ETHNOGRAPHY. Two lines of evidence are used to reconstruct the social structure of the
Gaulish Celts, who occupied France in the first century B.C. The first is literary. Roman and
Greek military personnel, merchants, and travellers mention only two classes of Celtic
society: an aristocracy composed of druids and knights, and commoners. The second source
of evidence is archaeological. Three internally stratified classes have been identified: an
aristocracy, an emergent middle class of artisans, bureaucrats, and merchants, and a lower
class Of rurally-based agriculturalists and urban migrants. The discrepancy between lines of
evidence is discussed and a composite mode! presented. (18)

Culbert, T. Patrick, VESSEL SHAPE IN CERAMIC ANALYSIS. in some systems of ceramic
analysis, vessel shape is treated as a secondary variable. This paper argues that any ceramic
analysis that pretends to completeness must inciude a full investigation of vessel shape as an
independent variable. Ceramic data from Tikal, Guatemala, indicate that vessel shape (1) is
as important for traditional chronological purposes as ceramic type: (2) is more closely :
related to ceramic use than are types; and (3) provides quantitative measures of standardiza-
tion in ceramic production that cannot be duplicated [n the usual typological attributes. (5)

to formulate and test hypotheses about Paleo-Indian preferences in land use for hunting; for
jookouts and for workshops; origins and changes in the present topography of this
landscape; relations of early hunters to a local Rancholabrean fauna; and differences in
locations favored for male and female workshop activities. (15)
Davis, Hester A., TRAINING AMATEUR ARCHAEOLOGISTS. Not every state has an
organized group of amateur archaeologists, but a vast majority of them do and some have
several. These groups have been doing and will continue to do archaeology, whether with
professional leadership or not. There are thousands of people who are members of these
organizations—a vast trainable resource. The professional archaeologists in several states have
been providing field and laboratory training for some of these groups to one degree or
another. tn Arkansas we have provided field training for 9 yr, but only in the past 2 yr have
we added to field and laboratory instruction for members of the Arkansas Archeotogical
Socijety, a formalized program of training which results in Certification by the Arkansas
Archeological Survey of individuals who complete the various categories of training
requirements. We do not believe we are training pothunters to be more efficient—we
believe—and have proof—that we are training lay archaeologists who will provide one of the
answers to the present problems of protecting and recovering our archaeological resources.

Davis, Jonathan O., and Robert Elston, GEQLOGIC AND PEDOLOGIC CHRONOLOGY
OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES IN NORTHWESTERN NEVADA. Stratiaraphic evidence
from recently excavated archaeological sites at Steamboat Springs (south of Reno) and at
the margin of the Black Rock Desert (northeast of Reno) documents recurring post-
Lahontan episodes of eolian deposition, erosion, and soil horizonation, Alternating sand
deposition and surface hardening at the margin of the Black Rock Desert reflect an
ephemeral Medithermal lake in the Black Rock Desert playa. At Steamboat Springs, eolian
and colluvial deposition, and intervals of soil B horizon formation, reflect fluctuations in
sediment sources. Radiocarbon and relative dating enables correlation with the Neoglacial
sequence and with Holocene records from the Great Basin. (14)
Davis, Leslie B., THE TWENTIETH CENTURY COMMERCIAL MINING OF GREAT
PLAINS BISON KILLS. Prehistoric bison kills were effectively destroyed in the northern
Great Plains by intensive bone mining for fertilizer and sugar and steel refining. This activity
flourished as an industry during both World Wars and during the Depression. Montana was
the primary center of exploitation and Ajiberta and the Dakotas received secondary
attention by bone miners. The short term economic benefits are analyzed in relation to the
waste of scientific and cultural resources. The bone mining phenomenon is viewed as a
historical continuation of an adaptive strategy appropriate through time in this arid-variable,
oftimes marginal environment. (38 A)
Deagan, Kathleen A., ETHNIC CONTINUITY IN FLORIDA: THE EASTERN TIMUCUA
AND THEIR PREDECESSORS. When the first Europeans arrived in Florida during the
sixteenth century, they found the eastern Timucua Indians with a culture substantially
unaltered from that of more than a millennium earlier. This long cultural continuity in the
northern St. Johns region of Florida has been archaeologically and documentarily demon-
strated; and the definition of this area as an ethnologically identifiable unit can be proposed
through the application of the direct historical method. The adaptation of the eastern
Timucua and their predecessors to a riverine-coastal environment, the internal structure of
their culture, and the external relations with the rest of the Southeast are considered in an
explanation of the processes of their development unti! the final decimation in historic
times. (19)
De Atley, Suzanne P., and Frank J. Findlow, ON RAW MATERIALS USE AND ENVIRON-

seen as adaptive responses that are sensitive to environmental change. A hypothesis designed
to explain some of the operations of raw materials procurement during periods of
environmentally induced stress is presented. Tests are made using patterns of prehistoric
obsidian use in the Chevelon Drainage of Arizona, A.D. 900-1500. (41)
DeBoer, Warren R., CERAMIC LONGEVITY AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETA-
TION: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE UPPER UCAYAL! RIVER, PERU. The relative
frequencies of various ceramic vessel forms in use at any one time may differ significantly
from the relative frequencies of these same forms when projected into the archaeological
record. One factor accounting for this difference is variable ceramic longevity; the shorter
the life span of a particular vessel form, the more rapidly it will enter the middens studied by
archaeologists. The observed and projected relative frequencies of vessel forms among the
Conibo tndians of the Upper Ucayali are compared to the frequencies of antecedent forms
in mortuary and midden archaeological samples from the Ucayali. The utility of ceramic
longevity data in providing estimates for the population size needed to generate an
archaeological midden Is also explored. (30)

Dienl, Richard A., TULA AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE MESOAMERICAN CLASSIC.
The evidence for Tula's participation in the demise of Teotinuacan and Classic Maya
societies is examined, There is no solid evidence at present that Tula was a functioning
center at A.D. 750, thus it could not have contributed to Teotihuacan’s downfall. It is
possible that some of the personnel who helped defeat Teotihuacan eventually settied at
Tula, It is also possible that some Tula-based Toitecs intruded into the Maya area and were
invoived in the collapse of Classic societies there. (27)

Dillehay, Tom D., SHIFTING RANGES AND SUCCESSIVE FLUCTUATIONS OF BISON
POPULATION DENSITIES ON THE SOUTHERN PLAINS DURING THE LATE
QUATERNARY, The Archaeological record of the southern Plains was thoroughly ex-
amined for the presence or absence of bison bones. The results were that 2 primary
temporal spans from about 6000-5000 B.C. to 2500 B.C. and A.D. 500 to A.D. 1200-1300
were characterized by the absence of any species of the Genus Bison in the area. Two
alternative concepts are presented as explanations for these changes in bison populations.
One concept is that these animals shifted their ranges by migrating either Partially or
completely to areas beyond the southern Plains. The other is that the density of bison
populations may have decreased dramatically, causing a very substantial reduction in the
economic exploitation of these animals in some aréas. (44)

Drover, Christopher E,, EARLY CERAMICS FROM COASTAL, SOUTHERN CALI-
FORNIA. Initial excavations of 4-ORA-64, a site located on the east bluff of upper Newport
Bay, were undertaken by a class from California State University, Fullerton, in 1971.
Excavations revealed a large, early Milling Stone Horizon site with an unusual artifactual
assemblage including fired-clay ceramics associated with early Carbon-14 dates. A grant
from the Irvine Co. was established to verify this chronology which extends 4000 yr B.C.
Discussion will be made of the approach to the problem, analytical techniques, and the
analytical results. The artifactual assemblage, specifically ceramics, wili be considered in
light of North American prehistory. (38A)

increasing frequency archaeologists dichotomize the notion culture into “normative” and

Many deficfencies of traditional approaches in both recovery and interpretation are
attributed to the normative view, While the deficiencies cited and the contrast of the
systemic view are apparent, the normative concept of culture appears to be a post hoc
rationalization by the holders of the systemic view. Other accounts for traditional practice
may prove more Useful in guiding innovation than the attribution of this particular notion as
the prime mover in recovery and interpretation. (17)

Dwyer, Edward B., and Jane P. Dwyer, EARLY URBANISM IN THE DEPARTMENT OF
CUZCO, PERU: INQUIRY AND ENIGMA. It is argued that ample evidence exists, both in
the literature and as a result of recent fieldwork, to generalize on the nature of developing
highland settlement and economic systems which required centralized political authority. A
model is presented in an attempt to characterize this development as one of early
dependence upon domestication of animals, the growth of urbanism as a residence pattern,
and the ultimate necessity for hillside terracing and irrigation projects. It is suggested that in
Cuzco this was an Early Horizon event which was not greatly influenced by the spread of
Chavin culture, (32)

, a compromise strategy model. This adaptive model posits that settlement location will be a
compromise among sets of opposing natural considerations affecting the agricultural basis of

determinant to settlement location along a xeric to mesic, elevational gradient. (23)

large numbers of students, most of whom will not become professional archaeologists.
Various options for teaching introductory archaeology are examined and the paper
concludes with a summary of 5 yr of research on the topic. (42)
Fairbanks, Charles H., ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE FLORIDA SEMINOLE. Documentary
sources indicate the changes which took place in Seminole material culture and settlement
patterns during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. To some extent archaeology has
been able to confirm the shift away from cohesive, town-square villages toward a more
diffuse settlement pattern, perhaps due to the assumption of European-American farming
methods. Ethnographic descriptions of changes in Seminole house types during the
eighteenth century are much more difficult to verify archaeologically due to the lack of
precise, extensive excavations of sites involyed. The documentation of Seminole artifact
inventories, however, has been possible. Changes following the Second Seminole War when
the Seminole moved into the Everglades and Big Cypress Swamp areas have not been
investigated by any systematic archaeology, although it is possible to describe the changes in
subsistence, settlement plan, and material culture from ethnohistoric sources, Neither has it
been possible to distinguish material culture differences that can be related to the 2 major
language groups among the Seminole. (19)

Ford, Richard !., TRAINING IN ANTHROPOLOGICAL ARCHAEOLOGY AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN. For more than 40 yr the Museum of Anthropology has
trained undergraduate and graduate students in the field and laboratory techniques for
solving archaeological problems. Although the museum is not a degree granting research
institution, staff members hold appointments in the Department of Anthropology, a
separate teaching unit. Classroom instruction, field experience, and Jaboratory research are
coordinated for achieving common goals. University courses serve as the basis for teaching
both theory and data. The museum offers an opportunity for students from any department
to participate in ongoing laboratory research throughout the year. For graduate students,
this research js directed with problem-solving as the basis for the training. Finally, the
muséum attempts to give undergraduate archaeology students field experience on one of its
many €xcavation or survey programs. All graduate students have field opportunities all year
long and are encouraged to participate in excavations in at least 2 continental areas. The
means, funding base, and accomplishments of this ambitious program will be discussed. (42)

Fowler, Melvin L., THE LATE PRECLASSIC OF THE VALLEY OF PUEBLA: SETTLE-
MENT SYSTEMS, LAND USE, AND URBANIZATION, The valley of Puebla in Central
Mexico was extensively occupied in the period from 600 B.C. to A.D. 200. The
characteristic site is a terraced hilltop with mounds surrounding a plaza. The slopes of the
hill were often terraced perhaps for habitation. A less common type of site was a mound
group and plaza on the valley floor. It is suggested that this latter type of site are central
sites tying together group of hilltop sites. Ceramic and other cultural debris suggests an
extensive octupation of the valley outside of the central communities, Systems of water
control for irrigation or other purposes were well known. This system of settlement and
implied social-political organization is contrasted with the Middle Prectassic and Classic of
same area and comments are offered on the processes of development of complex societies
and population nucleation. (18)
Fredrickson, David, A., CULTURAL DIVERSITY IN EARLY CENTRAL CALIFORNIA: A
VIEW FROM THE NORTH COAST RANGES. Investigations in the North Coast Ranges
have added to accumulating data which suggest that the traditional central California
cultural sequence of Early, Middle, and Late Horizons, is a limited regional rather than a
synthetic areal sequence, The North Coast Ranges investigations, together with work already
reported from San Francisco Bay and the Lower Sacramento Valley, provide data on
radiocarbon dating, obsidian hydration measurements, stratigraphic relationships, and
artifactual comparisons which suggest that a model of interregional diversity is more
appropriate for the earlier time periods in central California than the traditional model
which emphasizes transregional homogeneity. (31)
Freeman, L. G., THE VIEW FROM THE CAVE: THE TRAINING OF PALEOLITHIC

men program for the training of paleo-anthropologists and prehistorians for Old Worid
research is presented. No department of anthropology unites the conditions necessary to
implement such a program alone. Factors affecting this kind of training are the interdis-
ciplinary and international nature of such research and the relatively high costs for
transporting trainees to the field. These special requirements impose especially high selective
Pressures on traineés and, as a result, insure that the population of professionals maintains
30
, itself below the level of current and projected demand. A further disadvantage to students
in this country is the lack of centers with facilities and staff from the spectrum of essential
disciplines. Some remedies are foreseen but they will involve a certain degree of dissolution
of inter- and intra-institutional boundaries which are now rather jealously defended. (42)
Frisbie, Theodore R., NEW PERSPECTIVES ON SOUTHWESTERN PUEBLO TRADE
RELATIONSHIPS. Pueblo trade has been a constant feature in archaeological reports with
“object orientation” as the primary goal. This paper is based on an archaeo-ethnological
madel which attempts to isolate the mechanisms of trade phenomena at various levels of
abstraction. Consideration is given to reciprocity versus trade, intra- versus extra-village
relationships, Pueblo versus non-Pueblo relationships, raw versus finished materials, and
prehistoric-historic fixed value commodities, i.e., money. inferences drawn through the use
of analogy suggest that a multi-component network of trade relationships is observable in
the archaeological record. (36) )
Frison, George C., PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS IN THE ANALYSIS OF TOOL USE,
Large communal animal kills provide evidence of intense and specific tool use. Analysis of
the skeletal remains, tools, and sharpening debitage recovered indicate many continuities
and many differences in butchering techniques through time and from one cultural group to
another. Some of these differences may be cultural and some may reflect differential access \
to raw materials. Applying the results of these analyses to experimental butchering
situations provides working hypotheses regarding too! manufacture, hafting, use, sharpening,
and other considerations. (2)
Fritz, John M., MODELS FOR PREHISTORIC SUBSISTENCE SYSTEMS. The creation,
explication and systematization of categorical and theoretical systems for past subsistence
systems and for their material indicators in the archaeological record are necessary
conditions for the expansion of empirically confirmed Knowledge of such systems.
Categorical systems for productive organizations and sequences of organizations have been
explicated and applied in the generation of a set of models for a subsistence system existing
in east-central Arizona at about 70 B.C. These categorical systems are defined and their .
application is exemplified by the description of a model for an animal procurement system.
The usefulness of these systems and the implications of their application for the testing of
models and for the development of subsistence and archaeological theory are considered,

Fry, G. F., and J. M. Adavasio, HUMAN ADAPTATION DURING THE ALTITHERMAL
IN THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN. Recent data from various lines of inquiry strongly
indicate the existence of an Altithermal interlude in the eastern Great Basin. However, the
local effects of this climatic episode do not appear to have had substantial impact either on
human adaptation or settlement patterns in this area. The utility of the Altithermal as an
explanatory or causal mechanism in archaeological interpretations in this sector of the Great
Basin is therefore rejected. (12)
Fry, Robert E., and Scott C. Cox, LATE CLASSIC POTTERY MANUFACTURE AND
DISTRIBUTION AT TIKAL, GUATEMALA. New information on the internal structuring
of Maya sites has been produced through the use of muliti-dimensional scaling techniques.
Analysis of ceramics from Late Classic phases at the major Maya site of Tikal demonstrates
how the distribution of attribute classes can be used to define community boundaries.
Residual variability in ceramic collections is explained primarily through the effects of social
class distinctions. (5)
Fryman, Frank B., DATA BANKS ON THE STATE LEVEL WITH PROPOSED FEDERAL
COORDINATION OF VARIOUS PROGRAMS. The computerized archaeological data bank
and some of its applications are briefly reviewed, with emphasis on the development of a
state-level data bank. In Florida, a data bank is being compiled containing information on all
recorded prehistoric and historic sites in the state. This data base is being accumulated
primarily from an ongoing state-wide survey of all significant sites for input with relay into a
cooperative program with the National Park Service’s National Register of Historic Places in
Washington. In addition to the site data, all of the artifact data from site surveying or
excavation plus all historical artifact data being acquired for a history of Florida museum
are being stored in Florida's data bank. Thus, the agency is being provided with a
comprehensive data base for input to programs protecting and preserving Fiorida’s historical
resources, and in interpretative research. (3)
Gaines, Sylvia W., A PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA BANKS. |
A pragmatic approach to implementing archaeological data banks at the level of individual
universities by utilizing available hardware and software is considered. The concept of
independent data banks within the framework of larger networks is being developed. Access
by remote terminal to each independent data bank is explored and the potentials of such an
approach are evaluated. (3)
Gibson, Robert, MONACHE MEADOWS AND COLD AIR DRAINAGE—-A HYPOTHESIS.
Archaeologists are aften concerned with the explanation of the settlement system in a given
area. A number of variables have been examined in order to better understand why
archaeological sites are located where they are. Some of these include proximity to water,

31
, proximity to exploitable resources, edaphic conditions, available site area, nearness to trade
routes. From a recent survey of Monache Meadows another variable, cold air drainage, seems
to be operating on site distribution in this area. (23)
Gilman, Antonio, APPROACHES TO THE STUDY OF THE NEOLITHIC OF THE
MAGHREB, The Neolithic period in the Maghreb has usually been studied in narrowly
culture-historical terms. Features have been analyzed to demonstrate the derivation either of
specific European traits from North Africa or of North African traits from Europe. it is
suggested that the importance of the Maghreb culture area for later European prehistory is
the contrast which the cultural stability of the former presents to the progressive culture
change of the latter. Examination of evidence for the Early Neolithic of the western
Maghreb suggests possible factors underlying this broad difference. (25)
Glennan, William S., THE BAKER SITE—AN EARLY LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE FROM THE
MOJAVE DESERT. The Baker site, located to the west of Pleistocene Lake Mohave, has
yielded an assemblage of surface collected chipped stone artifacts. The temporal and
cultural placement of the Baker site and its associated artifacts is based on the tocation of
the site, its relationship to Lake Mohave, other sites in the area, and raw material sources,
the character, form, frequency, and raw material of the various types of artifacts, and the
known cultural sequence for the Mojave Desert. Preliminary investigations indicate that the
artifacts reflect an occupation of the site 10,000 or more years ago. (15)

in terms of Ayres’ variables (ethnicity, household income, and number, volume, and cost of
commodities). Differential patterning of meat and liquor consumed in an urban environ-
ment is viewed here with regard to a larger continuing project which is currently attempting
to determine relationships between modern material refuse (household garbage) and relevant
census and other elicited survey data. The results of both projects (Beef and Booze | and 11)
| are compared to derive trends which characterize a century of meat and liquor consumption
in an urban environment, (9)
Gould, Richard A., CONTINUOUS AND DISCONTINUOUS MODELS IN ETHNO-
ARCHAEOLOGY. Ethno-archaeology, as a general approach, has been widely used (and
sometimes misused) in the past. An effort is needed now to make this approach more
scientifically self-conscious. Several aspects of ethno-archaeology are discussed here with
reference fo cases drawn from Australia and California; “living archaeology” versus
ethno-archaeology, archaeological visibility, the site-oriented approach, native versus
“archaeological” classification of artifacts, etc. These problems can best be viewed in terms
of a framework which distinguishes between continuous models, in which there is
| stratigraphic continuity between the ethnographic adaptation in an area and archaeological
| sequences for that area, and discontinuous models, where ethnographic adaptations from
| areas distant from the scene of excavation are being compared and where there is no
| stratigraphic continuity. (17)

Grayson, Donald K., THE NIGHTFIRE ISLAND AVIFAUNA AND THE ALTITHERMAL.
The Nightfire Island site, on northern California's Lower Klamath Lake, was occupied from
approximately 4000 B.C. to A.D. 1400. Analysis of the avifaunal remains from this long
occupation suggests that between 4000 B.C. and 2200 B.C, Lower Klamath Lake levels
were higher than during subsequent years represented at the site, 2200 B.C. to A.D. 1400.
This in turn suggests that the traditional model of postglacial climatic history, which
includes a hot and dry Altithermal period between approximately 5000 B.C. and 2500 B.C.
does not apply to this area of the Desert West. Neither analysis of the mammalian remains
from Nightfire Island nor previous palynological and archaeological studies in the Lower
Klamath Basin seems to test these conflicting hypotheses concerning the reality of a hot and
dry Altithermal in the Lower Klamath area. (4)
Greaves, Thomas C., THE ECOLOGY OF UNCERTAINTY: RESPONSE TO A
DISASTROUS FLOOD BY AN AGRARIAN ANDEAN COMMUNITY. The disastrous flood
suffered by a water-scarce Andean agrarian community asserts that our usual ecological
mode! should systematically include short-term risk. These case materials illustrate the
following: (1) societies respond to risk through culture; (2) societies evince risk-taking
strategies with their environment which set and can change the level of risk; (3) when the
risk strategy fails the society marshalls contingency plans, may revise its risk strategy, and
contains threats by compartmentalizing them. Hence the short-run aspects of an ecological
model appear to be as necessary in accounting for cultural behavior as are the long-run
aspects. (1)

Greengo, Robert E., SETTLEMENT PATTERN SURVEY IN NORTHEASTERN
GUERRERO, MEXICO. This paper represents a first approximation in the analysis of
settlement data collected in 1967, and is part of a long term study of land use in the region.
Sixty-two sites are included in the present sample of which most (55) are in the Grainage of
the Rio Tepecoacuilco, while the other 7 are drained by the Rio Amacuzac, both being
tributary to the Rio Balsas. Data are classified by site type, size, elevation above sea level,
and type of terrain. The largest proportion of sites (53 or 84.5%) were noted as having
mounds, structures, building foundations, and sherds. With regard to cultural period, it is
clear from the preliminary survey that sites of both the earliest period, Preclassic, and the
latest, Aztec, range through the extremes of terrain types delineated in the study. More
intensive survey is projected for more detailed control of cultural and ecological variables.

Grieder, Terence, THE EARLY INTERMEDIATE SYSTEM OF IMAGES SEEN FROM
PASHASH. Two systems of images were established in the Andean region. The first in
Chavin, emphasized non-objective signs (S-curve, equal-arm cross) and multi-animals. The
second, founded in the Early Intermediate and persisting into the Late Horizon, centered on
a purely human figure surrounded by feline-serpents, often double-headed, and birds. The
human, usually frontal, may have superhuman traits (fangs), but often is indistinquishable
from a warrior. Use of this system from Tiwanaku to San Agustin indicates widespread
intellectual contacts, despite abundant evidence of warfare and its glorification in the
images. (32)
Griffin, James B., A REVIEW OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS
IN ARCHAEOLOGY. From the first relief labor archaeological excavation at Marksville,
Louisiana, in August, 1933, to the end of the programs about 1942, 4a great many
archaeological sites were surveyed and excavated jin the United States with support from the
Federal Government. This was certainly the most productive 10 yr period that American
archaeology has had in terms of acduisition of data, development of a chronological
framework, and recognition of extensive inter-areal relationships. A large number of
important publications resulted from this work and many current archaeologists par-
ticipated in the programs. (14)
Griffin, James B., THE SOURCE OF HOPEWELLIAN OBSIDIAN AND (TS DISPERSAL
PATTERN IN MIDDLE WOODLAND SITES. For many years archaeologists attempted to
ascertain the source of obsidian found in Hopewellian sites in Ohio and in Illinois. While
sources in Mexico, the Southwest, and even in Peru had been suggested, the most reasonable
source identified by most archaeologists was the Yellowstone area. Neutron activation
studies at the University of Michigan strongly indicate that the Yellowstone region was
indeed the source. In Ohio there is a high concentration of the obsidian in one or two of the
major Hopewell sites and in Iilinois and Upper Mississippi Valley there is a small amount of
material found at a larger number of sites. Indications are that the obsidian was not a part of
a well-organized economic exchange or trade system, but that other explanations must be
sought for the meaning of the pattern of its distribution. (21)

Grossman, Joel W., LONG DISTANCE TRADE AND IDEA EXCHANGE DURING THE
INITIAL PERIOD. Until recentiy the Initial period has been drawn as being a time of
regional isolation with little or no interaction between the various early pottery making .
peoples of the Andean area. However, recent work in the south central hightands has .
provided evidence which supports a more fiuid situation. The analysis of a new Initial period
style, Muyumogo, from the site of Waywaka in Andahuaylas, suggests that a wide-ranging |
pool of commonly held ideas may have existed throughout the central and southern regions
of Peru during the first 2 millennia B.C. This is indicated not only by general features of
ceramic design but also by close parallels in specific features of design between pottery
styles found as far apart as the Chicama valley in the north and the Cuzco basin in the
33
, south. Furthermore, while indirect contact may have been a factor, several lines of
independent evidence suggest that direct trade, or even possibly movement of groups, was
| taking place between both coast and sierra and between southern and central hightands at
least as early as 1500 B.C. (32)

Haag, William G., THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY ARCHAEOLOGICAL PRO-
GRAM. The origin of TVA's involvement in archaeology is an integral part of the whole
development of federal aid to archaeology. The years 1934 to 1942 saw sites excavated that
exceed in number all the scientific excavations that had ever been done before in the United
States. The obstacles that had to be overcome were numerous also, not the least being the
image that archaeology was dilettantism and the use of that manpower would be better
spent on road construction. Most of the driving force behind the TVA program came from
one man, W. S, Webb, but there were trained archaeologists to structure the fieldwork, the
New Archaeology of that generation. Most of the excavations have been Gescribed, but
analyses and interpretations are greatly limited. (14)

discovery of 42 sites. Most were chipping stations, although the presence of bone meal and
domestic tools at some suggests short-term campsites associated with caribou hunting.
Recovered artifacts include Campus and other cores, numerous microblades, fish-tail and
other projectile points and scrapers. A preliminary analysis of the recovered artifacts suggests
correlations with material from the Lower Bench site at Cape Krusenstern and a dating of
around 5000 yr ago. (7)

define the boundaries of these trading spheres and to adduce the nature of their operation.
The similarity of this construct to the concept of ‘ceramic sphere’ utilized in type-variety

Harper, KY T., CLIMATES OF THE LAST 10,000 YEARS IN THE NORTHEASTERN
GREAT BASIN AS INFERRED FROM CULTURAL DEPOSITS IN CAVES. During the
past score of years, the cultural deposits of a number of caves in the northeastern Great
Basin have been excavated. A rich diversity of biological remains from strata of known age
have been identified by experts in many fields. Aimost without exception, the species
encountered in the deposits of the last 10,000 yr can still be found in the near vicinity of
| the caves. By combining a Knowledge of modern ecological requirements of individual
species with their relative abundance in the deposits, one can draw inferences concerning
climatic conditions prevailing during the various periods of deposition. Based upon such
evidence, a climatic sequence for the northeastern Great Basin is formulated and the
supporting evidence presented. The sequence is compared with other climatic models and its
implications for human ecology are discussed. (4)

Hauck, Forrest Richard, THE PRECLASSIC HYDRAULIC COMPLEX AT EDZNA,
CAMPECHE, MEXICO. During the months of October through December, 1972, a variety
of hydraulic systems were investigated at the Lowland Maya site of Edzna. These systems
consist of canals, reservoirs and aguadas which were evidently constructed for the purpose
| 34
, of drainage and manual irrigation. The canals vary from 12 km to 600 m long and the
reservoirs range from 14 m in diameter to large constructions over 100 min length by 60 m.
The investigation of these hydraulic features was accomplished in 3 parts: an ecological
study of climate, soil, and general aquatic life; a surface survey and mapping of several areas
containing a variety of the hydraulic systems; and excavation at critical points for the
purpose of determining temporal aspects, construction techniques, and land-use. (38A)

Escuintia plain of Guatemala. Some scenes on cylinder tripods are in pure Teotihuacan
style, others are local coastal adaptations of Teotihuacan style, others are in a possibly
proto-Cotzumaihuapa style, others have Veracruz-Chichen Itza-like ball game scenes, and
others show persons attired in a strange coastal Oaxaca style. Several vessels have all these
different styles in the same scene. This contemporaneity (ca. fifth to sixth centuries A.D.)
may necessitate revising traditional dates for Cotzumalhuapa and {Toltec) Chichen liza
styles. (5)

Hicks, Frederic, and H. B. Nicholson, THE CLASSIC PERIOD AT CERRO PORTEZVUELO,
BASIN OF MEXICO. The Classic period in central Mexico was dominated by Teotihuacan.
It has been suggested that Teotihuacan played such a pervasively dominant socio-political
role in central Mexico that few other centers of substantial size flourished at this time,
perhaps as the direct result of Teotihuacan economic and population relocation policies.
One site whose earliest phase was coeval with at least the later portion of the floruit of
35
, Teotihuacan was Cerro Portezuelo, tocated about 23 mi to the south. The artifactual
typology and architecture of Cerro Portezuelo’s Classic period phase are summarized and
comparisons are undertaken with the contemporaneous artifactual types and architectural
remains at Teotihuacan and other relevant central Mexican sites. The nature of the
relationship between Teotihuacan and Cerro Portezuelo is discussed within the context of
the larger problem of possible sociocultural interactive mechanisms between Teotihuacan

by the length of time required to perform the laboratory process. This study uses a new
technique of sample processing to test the applicability of phosphate analysis for use by
archaeologists concerned with settlement activity. On the basis of tests from 2 Mexican
archaeological sites, it is concluded that phosphate analysis can be used to find and compare
areas of differential human activity when other traditional methods can not. (33)

alternative to the assumption that Hawaiian socio-political systems had not advanced beyond
the chiefdom tevel before contact, this hypothesis provides a new framework within which
archaeological research can be conducted. Recent emphasis on settlement pattern and
ecological approaches has stimulated the study of problems related to this hypothesis such

Ingersoll, Daniel W., THE ASHMAN COMETH. Archaeological and non-archaeological
artifacts and printed records relating to material culture are used to analyze contemporary
popular attitudes toward the Spanish American War. Attitudes inferred from material
culture are contrasted to ones implicit or directly expressed in political, governmental, or
other historical accounts, contemporary and recent. It is concluded that the average
American citizen (U.S.A.) approved of or favored imperialistic expansion and found the war
and the new possessions a source of excitement and pride, even though many governmental
sources attempted to emphasize moralistic and other non-imperialistic goals and ideals as
justification for the war and the territorial additions. The dominant popular attitudes are
seen as a major source of political support and for the retention of territories gained. (9)

is that among this group certain social conventions limit fertility in such a way as to

it was argued that state institutions rise in response to offensive and defensive warfare in
environmental situations where defensive retreat is prevented. Recent clarification of the
economic basis of Andean states demands a reexamination of Carneiro’s propositions and

also provides a basis for an alternative formulation. The location of political centers and

their sphere of influence provides information concerning the economic factors upon which

Andean states were based, and suggest a pattern for understanding the initial elaboration of

complex political institutions generally. (32)

Arizona-University of Michigan Project. These materials range from Late Acheulian

industries in the lowest levels to Levalloiso-Mousterian in the upper levels, and include
37
, Yabrudian and Amudian layers in the middle levels. This paper will present some
preliminary results of metric and qualitative analysis of a portion of this collection. (25)
Jeiks, Edward B., THE USE AND MISUSE OF RANDOM SAMPLING IN ARCHAE-
OLOGY. In an effort to apply sophisticated statistical methods to archaeological problems,
some archaeologists in recent years have devised various techniques for acquiring random
samples of empirical field data. Many of these techniques are ineffective because they
produce only a random sample of small objects from different parts of a site, not a random
sample of all the cultural data contained within the site. The concept of random sampling is
reviewed, misapplications of the concept in archaeology are enumerated, the theoretical
basis for effective random sampling is discussed, and criteria for appropriate random
| sampling techniques in archaeology are presented. (28)
| Jensen, Peter M., FORMAL ANALYSIS OF THE LEAF SHAPED POINT IN EARLY
| AMERICAN PREHISTORY. The leaf-shaped projectile points from various North, Middle,
and South American sites are examined. Locally derived typologies are seen as tending
| toward internal consistency and consequently toward meaningful indicators of chonistic and
| cladistic relationships. More recent attempts to extend the designation “‘leaf-shaped" within
| the context of a postulated Pan-Cordilleran tradition appear Unvalidated. Statistical ;
procedures used in the recognition and formation of ‘“‘types” are discussed, and a tentative
‘*key” for the identification of the Ayampitn lteaf-shaped point is offered. (16)
Jermann, Jerry V., A CONSIDERATION OF COMPUTER METHODS IN THE STUDY OF :
PREHISTORIC COMMUNITY PATTERN STRUCTURE. A methodological discussion of
several different computer techniques for the characterization and elucidation of com-
munity pattern structure in archaeological assernblages is presented. Each method is assessed
as to its utility and limitations in discriminating macro- and micro-community structures.
| The methods are illustrated by the examination of a late prehistoric town from eastern
Kentucky. (18)
Joesink-Mandeville, L. R. V., MANI PATTERN BURNISHED WARE IN THE MIDDLE
FORMATIVE: REASSESSMENT OF BRAINERD’S MANI CENOTE COLLECTION IN
LIGHT OF HIS FIELD NOTES. The acquiring in 1971 of George W. Brainerd’s fieldnotes
concerning his excavations at Mani Cenote prompted a return to Merida to study his
collections. The ceramic sequence in Trenches 1 and 2 was analyzed and the stratigraphic
placement of pure deposits of Mani Pattern Burnished Ware in the bottom of these trenches
was verified. Directly overlying these deposits in Trench I (levels D and E) is a level (C)
yielding both water bottie and recognizable Middle Formative sherds, while the upper levels
(A and B) abound in Late Formative pottery. Recent evidence from Dzibilchaltun and
elsewhere is also utilized in collaborating the chronological placement of the Mani Cenote
ware. (5)
Johnson, Alfred E., KANSAS CITY HOPEWELL HUNTING AND GATHERING
TERRITORIES. Analyses of floral and faunal materials from Kansas City Hopewell sites
indicate a subsistence economy based on hunting and gathering locally-available resources.
Settlement pattern data are used to suggest a mode! of the nature of hunting and gathering
territories. The validity of the model is tested by a consideration of stylistic variablity of
artifacts. (41)
Johnson, Ann S., TREND-SURFACE ANALYSIS OF RADIOCARBON DATES FROM
WOODLAND SITES IN THE PLAINS, Trend-surface analysis is applied to radiocarbon
dates from Woodland sites in the Plains, so as to discover the broad-scale spatial trends in
these dates. The 5730 half-life, 5570 half-life, and Suess correction are used. The result isa
heuristic, mathematical model. This model produces a topographic-like map summarizing
the trend of the dates, from which inferences can be drawn about the Woodland as an
archaeological entity. (44)
Judge, W. James, James !. Ebert, and Robert K. Hitchcock, TRANSECT SAMPLING IN
REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY. The Southwestern Anthropological Research
Group (SARG) offers a great deal of potential to archaeologists interested in undertaking
research at the regional level, and the importance of a reliable sampling design is
well-recognized by its participants. This paper critically examines the recommended strip
transect sampling design in tight of the kinds of data required for the solution of the
research problem central to the SARG design (i.e., why are sites located where they are?).
Data from the archaeological survey of Chaco Canyon, collected in 1971 and 1972, are
employed to test the reliability and effectiveness of strip (belt) transects in gathering data
specifically relevant to the SARG research design. Alternative sampling techniques
commonty employed in other disciplines are reviewed, and the SARG sampling design is
evaluated in terms of the results of the testing. (28)

, Katz, Paul R., THE LITHIC TECHNOLOGY OF A CERAMIC COMPLEX. Analysts agree
that, because of its reductive procedures, the reconstruction of a lithic technology
necessitates a concentration on debitage rather than, but not excluding, the shaped products.
The fact that Kansas City Hopewell refuse pits are the only lithic-bearing units available for
analysis which provide temporal, spatial, and cultural controls makes the employment of
debitage not only desirable, but mandatory. One goal of my study is the establishment of a
model for Kansas City Hopewell lithic technological processes, using observation, replica-
tion, and multivariate statistical analyses; another goal is the comparison of the interpretive
value of the processes with that of ceramic studies for the same complex. The results of the
study will be presented. (2)
Kautz, Robert R., POLLEN FROM HUMAN COPROLITES IN NORTHERN CHILE. Pollen
extracted from human coprolites in archaeological contexts in northern Chile indicates the
feasibility of such research as an adjunct to sophisticated ecosystem and economic
archaeological analysis in that part of the world. Results are variable, depending on factors
such as extraction technique and condition of the sample. Interpretation is affected by the
above factors as well as accidental ingestion, time elapsed since eating. and the common
factors of differential pollen production and destruction. (16)
Keatinge, Richard W., CHIMU CERAMICS FROM THE MOCHE VALLEY, PERU:
ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS AS A BASIS FOR SERIATING DOMESTIC POTTERY. The
focus of this paper is toward setting up tentative yet reliable divisions within the Chimu
sequence. The sequence presented is based on a seriation of excavated collections from
several sites in the Moche Valley. An important feature of the seriation is that is is based
largely on domestic ceramics rather than the fine funerary wares upon which other Chimu
seriations are almost exclusively based. In order to give the seriation more than simply
subjective validity, a computerized analysis was Undertaken, applying selected statistical
tests of significance and correlation to the data. (26)
Kehoe, Alice B., DERIVATION AND TESTING OF A MODEL OF CULTURE CONTACT
FROM AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY FUR TRADE POST. Data from the Francois-Finlay
site, a contact-period (1768-73) “peddlars’ " fur trading post on the Saskatchewan River, is
used to construct an archaeologically-recognizable model of intercultural relations: when a
colonial entrepreneur extracts a natural product obtained by the indigenous population, the
native artifact classes show little distortion, the entrepreneurs’ imports consist of 2 classes,
(1) cheaply-transportable manufactured goods for trade, (2) easily-transportable identity
images reinforcing the entrepreneurs’ cultural identity. Tested against data from Carthage,
Norse settlements, and others, the model can distinguish colonies from factories. (40)
Kelley, David H., COSTUME AND NAME IN MESOAMERICA. The Mixtec codices
frequently show the same individuals, as indicated by their calendar names and genealogies,
in different situations. In these, a person's name may appear as a separate glyphic drawing in
one case and as part of his costume in another. It is not clear whether these costumes were
actually worn or are merely a graphic device, but since the concept was present, some
individuals probably did wear their names sometimes. Some Maya representations indicate
the same practice. (22)
Kelley, J. Charles, and Ellen Abbott Kelley, THE RISE AND FALL OF THE CLASSIC AS
SEEN FROM THE NORTHWESTERN FRONTIER OF MESOAMERICA. The rise and fall
of the Classic is reflected, inferentially, in the culture history of the Northwestern Frontier.
Exploitative occupation of the Chaichihuites area, coincidental with the maximum develop-
ment of Teotihuacan, by an intrusive group whose ceramic art and ceremonialism links them
stylistically and thematically with central Mexico suggests that the rise of the central
Mexican Classic was accomplished by economic penetration and exploitation with military
support and associated religious proselytism over an extensive geographic area. Contrary to
some views, the cultures of the Northwest appear to be largely of Mesoamerican derivation
and affiliation, although tacking visible Olmec characteristics. (27)

Kelly, Roger E., THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL LABORATORY: STEP-SISTER OR CIN-
DERELLA? A short survey study of departmental offerings and personal experience
indicates that the pedagogy of American archaeology slights the laboratory. Lack of usable
literature, the glamour of the field situation, and limited departmental capital combine to
make the laboratory a step-sister of the field situation. With recognition of the scope and
importance of laboratory research and redirection of effort, the laboratory could become as
important as tieldwork for the teaching of anthropological archaeology. (42)

Kessier, Evelyn S., A PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION OF CERAMICS FROM THE TOLAS
OF OTAVALO, ECUADOR. In the summer of 1972, the author surveyed and tested sites in
and around the town of Otavalo, in Highland Ecuador. Although the area abounds with
large earthen mounds, called Tolas, it has not been investigated since 1912, when some work
was done by Verneau and Rivet. Typical sherds from 11 test sites will be shown on slides,
and described. Also, certain ceramics which appear to be trade ware will be shown. An
attempt will be made to correlate these with the description of the ‘cara Phase," by
Meggers. Future work in the area will more closely define the nature of the tolas, the
society which supported them, and the time period to which they can be assigned. (45)
Kikuchi, William K,, PREHISTORIC HAWAIIAN AQUACULTURE, Found on all islands
and in all districts, the 12 types of the prehistoric Hawaiian aquacultural system were
geographically determined or, where needed, artificially made. Fishponds were under .
conspicuous ownership. Accepted belief has been that the commoners benefited from these
sizable supplies of protein, but recent research indicates otherwise. Because of the mobile
nature of the court, aquaculture developed to provide a fresh, relatively abundant supply of
preferred fish on demand. As the royalty began to mimic the Western way of establishing
capitals and as the cash economy replaced the native economic system, aquaculture likewise -
began its decline. (10)

King, Chester, AN EXPLANATION OF DIFFERENCES AND SIMILARITIES OF BEADS.
Differences in the dimensions of beads which are contemporary are related to the
maintenance of separate flaw networks connecting different energy stores. The use of
different beads in different networks results in differential distributions of beads in
mortuary contexts and in site contexts. Changes in the dimensions of beads over time can be
described in terms of energy invested in manufacture and resulting show. Changes in beads
can be either the result of (1) increased or decreased complexity within particular
interaction networks resulting in either divergence or convergence of types used in the
network or (2) changes in the cost of maintaining sufficient show to validate status which is
related to the potential for participation in different networks. Application of the concept
of a cost-show ratio in explaining the sequences of shell beads in different areas of California
indicate continual growth of cultural systems accompanied by increased specialization of
iat networks, increases in energy stored, and increased specializations of managerial roles.

King, Thomas F., BUCHANAN V: A STUDY OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATION IN THE
CENTRAL CALIFORNIA MIDDLE HORIZON, California hunter-gatherers may be con-
sidered typical of non-agriculturalists living in rich, varied environments, so considerable
effort has been expended in recent years toward explicating their forms of political
organization. Most such studies, however, have been hampered by poor data-bases, the
possibility of “contamination” by contact with white culture, or both. A recent study of
1500 yr old cemeteries on the Chowchilla River in central California provides the basis for
some new assessments. (31)

Kirch, Patrick V., EARLY SETTLEMENT AND PROBLEMS OF ADAPTATION IN
HAWAI!. Recent archaeological excavations on Oahu and Molokai Islands have provided
evidence of Polynesian settlement by at least A.D. 600, on windward coasts in ecologically
focal locations. Evidence from these early sites also suggests that the initial settlers possessed
a fairly wide-ranging base of subsistence techniques, including shifting (dryland) and
irrigated cultivation, animal husbandry, and marine exploitation. In this paper these data
will be examined in terms of adaptation to high-island environments. Evidence for local
intensification of agricultural systems will also be considered. The time perjod involved is
roughly A.D. 600-1200. (10)

ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. The occurrence of a specific chert type at sites discovered
during a 1972 site survey in west-central New Mexico by the Cibola Archaeological Research

testing of hypotheses concerning raw material distribution. The validity of a movement
lapse rate rnodel for cases dealing with limited geographic areas is considered. (34)

Knudson, Ruthann, EDGE MORPHOLOGIES AND FUNCTIONAL UNITS, AYACUCHO,
PERU. Computer-assisted attribute analysis of patterns of edge characteristics on lithic
implements was conducted this past year on 9-4000 yr old assemblages from the Ayacucho
Valley, Peru. Concern with the multi-functional dimensions of most implements ted to
formulation of the “functional unit,"’ that portion of an implement assumed to be
appropriate for completion of particular task categories. Functional units, or FU's, were
thus the units of analysis, rather than entire artifacts. Uitimately, edge morphology patterns
will be used to delineate culture-historically significant variations in tool kits, and
association of these with faunal and floral data should suggest patterns of site utilization.

Kolb, Charles, C., THE OLD SHELL GAME: A MESOAMERICAN TRADE NETWORK.
Quantities of unworked marine shell from both the Panamanian and Caribbean Marine
Faunal Provinces were recovered from excavations and surveyed sites in the Teotihuacan
Valley, central Mexico. The bulk of the material was associated with Classic Teotihuacan
ceramic materials (Late Tilamimiloipa to Late Xolalpan, ca. A.D. 450-750) at a rural site,
Santa Maria Maquixco Bajo, partly excavated by personnel from the Teotihuacan Valley
Project (William T. Sanders, director). The archaeological distribution of Spondytus calcifer
(Carpenter 1857) suggested that a smali social group functioned as trade ‘‘middiemen" in the
importation of Pacific Coast shell to Teotihuacan, and were possibly involved in the
subsequent market distribution to artisans at the urban center. Alternative hypotheses are
also examined. (36)
Krotser, Paula H., EXAMPLES OF THE USE BY AN ARCHAEOLOGIST OF HER
ETHNOGRAPHIC STUDIES OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND SOCIOLOGY OF MEXICAN
VILLAGE POTTERS. It is proposed that the archaeologist working where ceramics are part
of the artifact inventory has much to gain from observing potters whose techniques
approximate those of the prehistoric culture. Not onty will he recognize the marks of tools
and techniques of construction and decoration on the sherds, which should make his types
more closely reflect the potters’ modes, but he will also acquire a fund of Knowledge about
the residence patterns, economics, and sociology of the potters that will contribute to a
more sophisticated interpretation of his total data. (26)

de Oso site is a small (ca. 50 hectares) area of irrigated agriculture associated with the
Chicama-Moche Canal, an important inter-valley canal in northern coastal Peru. The site
contains several structures, but is most interesting for its near perfect preservation of
irrigation features. The remains of agricultural fields in the central portion of the site were
studied in detail. Six different furrow design types were identified and analyzed, particularly
with regard to such factors as slope, field size, and possible crops. (45)

Lange, Frederick W., SLAVE MORTUARY PRACTICES ON BARBADOS. Excavations
were conducted in a pre-Emancipation slave cemetery on the island of Barbados during
spring, 1972. Skeletal materials were relatively wel) preserved and most permitted the
identification of sex and approximate age. Mortuary practices regarding modes of interment
and complementary grave goods were also determined and together with the physical data
could be subjected to more or less standard burial analyses. Historical documentation
relevant to this cemetery permitted us to extend our analysis to an assessment of the
potentials and limitations of archaeological methodology in cases such as the one described.

Laughlin, W. S., A. B. Harper, and S. B. Laughlin, SEA LEVEL, STRATIGRAPHY AND
RADIOCARBON DATING OF THE ANANGULA UNIFACIAL INDUSTRY: 8400-7600
B.P, Three forms of evidence independent of each other—sea level, volcanic ash stratigraphy,
and radiocarbon dates—show agreement in placing the span of occupation of the Anangula
inhabitants from 8400 B.P. to 7600 B.P. Excavations of 1972 show that the occupation is 5
m above an exposed 7 m wave cut terrace which silhouettes the island. This marine terrace
indicates that tectonic uplift took place, the minimal amount of the uplift, and the time
that it occurred. The low periphery of the site is as old (8435+500) as the higher portion of
the site. The more recent post-uplift village occupation is 22 m above sea level. This
elevation indicates the minimum elevation required for year round occupation of Anangula.
A rising sea level curve based on data inside Nikolski Bay indicates that the inhabitants were
forced to leave because of sea level encroachment around 7600 yr ago. The site was
preserved by tectonic uplift taking place between 6000 and 5500 yr ago, an event which
drained Nikolski Bay and altered the southern end of Umnak tstand. (7)
Lees, Susan H., (RRIGATION, ECOLOGICAL FEEDBACK, AND POLITICAL DEVELOP-
MENT. Archaeological reconstructions of the development of complex, centralized political

41
, structures generally ignore ecological feedback processes arising from concomitant environ-
mental exploitation patterns. The study of hydraulic facility development in relation to
political organization is particularly enlightening in this regard. The explanation of cyclical
patterning in the growth, expansion, decline, and disintegration of centralized hierarchical
political organization in societies dependent upon hydraulic facilities should take environ-
mental feedback into account. This paper will describe and discuss such a pattern as it has
occurred in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico, and attempt to apply conclusions from this study
to apparently similar processes occurring elsewhere in the archaeological and ethnographic
record. (1)
Leone, Mark P., MATERIAL CULTURE IN AMERICAN UTOPIAS. Utopias founded under
religious aegis Usually attempted to express their principles for guiding life in every activity,
including the community's technology. Most objects had explicit ideological significance.
This is certainly true among nineteenth century Mormons and shakers. Further, objects were
often fashioned in such a way that their form and use reinforced the ideology manifested in
them. This feedback relationship is usually an opaque one in American culture, but in our
utopias it was clearly understood. After these utopias were absorbed into mainline American
society, the explicitness of the relationship between their religious ideals and the form of
objects disappeared. The specifics of this evolutionary sequence are treated in this paper in .
an effort to understand the interrelationships between the basic technology of a group and
its conscious ideology. (9)
Lewis, Father Clifford M., THE CALUSA,. The group covered in this presentation was
described by Goggin and Sturtevant as the Calusa, a stratified, non-agricultural society
occupying a subarea of the Glades aréa in southwestern Florida. Their principal areas of
occupation were along the west coast of Florida between Charlotte Harbor and Key Marco,
with lesser sub-areas to the east, principally that near Lake Okeechobee. The culture is
characterized by construction of elaborate mounds and canals, whose features seem to
indicate ritual as well as practical significance. Efforts of Jesuit and Franciscan missionaries
to establish centers among the Calusa met with failure, but first-hand reports on the culture
by the Jesuits and the early accounts of Menendez’ attempts to cultivate the group provide
many valuable details. (19)

differences in subsistence-settlement patterns between the Atlantic sector (Bocas province)
and the Pacific sector (Chiriqui province) of western Panama during the Classic period (A.D.
300-900) are attributed to evolutionary divergence in members of one original highland-

Lyons, Thomas R., James |. Ebert, and Robert K. Hitchcock, THE USE OF REMOTE
SENSING IN THE MAPPING AND ANALYSIS OF A PREHISTORIC IRRIGATION
SYSTEM. A prehistoric irrigation system at Kin Bineola near Chaco Canyon in northwestern
New Mexico was microtopographically mapped with the use of easily-obtained black-and-
white aerial photographs and a Kelsh plotter with the intent of determining the effectiveness
of photogrammetric procedures in identifying cultural features in an arid region of
extremely low relief, in delineating appropriate problems, and in planning subsequent
42
, archaeological research strategy. It is acknowledged that remote sensing is not an end in
itself, and that its proper use can only come after the framing of valid questions to be asked
of the visual record; with this in mind, the application of aerial remote sensing to several
possible archaeological problems is discussed. Aerial and satellite remote sensing techniques
are more than mere reconnaissance tools and have analytical and explanatory import to
archaeologists and anthropologists. (39)

McVicker, Donald E., POTS—PAST AND PRESENT. Recently students of material culture
have examined modern ceramic production from an archaeologically relevant perspective.
However, the applicability of these case studies of pre-industrial technology to the study of
the social and ideological correlates of ceramics in complex societies is questionable, To
explore the structure of these correlates in an urban environments, the analysis of modern
place settings sold throughout the branches of a department store serving diverse sectors of
the buying public was undertaken. Preliminary results suggested that certain dimensions of
complex social organization were as clearly expressed in the distribution and
“consumption” of items of material culture as they were in observed behavior or recorded
expectations. it was concluded that, given appropriate methodologies and techniques,
statements about selected cultural sub-systems based upon items of material culture can be
more efficiently derived and scientifically validated than similar statements based solely
upon traditional ethnological data. (9)
Mack, Joanne M.,. IMPLICATIONS OF “SHIELD FIGURES" FROM THE BIG HORN

is better explained by “the theory of limited possibilities.’' It is also concluded that
attributes (other than a circular design element), which make up the shield figure, should be
analyzed and compared, rather than the whole figure. (26)

MacNeish, Richard S., THE AYACUCHO ARCHAEOLOGICAL SEQUENCE. tn Ayacucho
duringthelast 4 yr,a22,000 yr sequence of archaeological remains has been uncovered. This
sequence is based upon the excavation of 20 stratified sites and is confirmed by 46
Carbon-14 dates. Studies of pollen, geomorphology, and soils correlate the archaeological
sequence with various periods of climatic change. There appears to be an early period of
glaciation with a maxima at about 16,000 yr ago, a further glacial period with a maxima
about 14,000 yr ago ending about 12,000 yr ago. Since that time, there has been a gradual
drying up of the valley although it was wetter and forest growth more extensive from
12,000 yr ago to about 5000 yr ago, Then there may be a drying period from 5000 to 3000
yr ago with increasing wetness from 3000 to about 1000 yr ago and then a final period of
desiccation. The archaeological sequence may be divided into 14 archaeological periods,
43
, throughout which there has been a stimulating set of interactions with other developments
in the hightands and on the coast. (32)

provided for Meadow Valley Wash, southeastern Nevada through interpretation of fossil
pollen, fossil plant macrofossils, alluvial stratigraphy, and a chronology established by 31

from a Pluvial plant community dominated by bristiecone pine-limber pine-white fir, to a
white fir-juniper-pinyon pine dominated community, to a juniper-oak-ash dominated
community similar to modern vegetation. Pollen from stratified cultural and non-cultural
sites shows a distinct vegetational change between Ca. 5000-3000 B.P., possibly indicating
dryer and/or warmer conditions. An increase of sagebrush and juniper pollen occurs
thereafter, with pine pollen being introduced and gradually becoming more important after
ca. 3000 B.P. A Post Pluvial sequence of cyclic alluvial erosion and deposition has occurred
in the wash, with 5 of these cycles having occurred in the last 2000 yr. (12)

Marcus, Joyce P., REGIONAL DRESS PATTERNS OF CLASSIC MAYA WOMEN, The
iconographic study of Maya women portrayed on Classic period monuments reveals distinct
regional dress patterns. Elite women in the upper Usumacinta drainage were probably
members of a common lineage, linguistic group, and all wear embroidered textiles.
High-status women in the Peten were members of a different linguistic group and wear
tubular-beaded “‘jade” skirts. The pattern recovered from these monuments can be explained
by linguistic, political, economic, and ecological variables. (22)

Martin, Paul S., AN APPROACH TO TRAINING ARCHAEOLOGISTS AS ANTHRO-
POLOGISTS: AN EDUCATIONAL PHILOSOPHY. The training program for students at
Vernon, Arizona, has undergone many changes since its inception 8 yr ago. At present, our
purpose is to increase the opportunities for undergraduates to obtain experience in
investigating a problem that is designed by and for each student as an individual. We have
found that an open approach to learning about sciences creates opportunities for research
participation that are not usually found in normal curricular patterns. By placing
responsibility for learning on the shoulders of able students, the problem-oriented approach
is a powerful motivator. Accordingly, learning proceeds along experimental, broadly based,
and multi-dimensional lines. Theoretical rigor is introduced and accompanies precise
data-gathering by competent “dirt” archaeologists. Innovative aspects of the field school
include theoretical orientation, an atmosphere of individual intellectual freedom, and an
emphasis upon inter-disciplinary and differing approaches within anthropology. (42)
Marwitt, John P., Robert V. Morey, and James A. Zeidler, RECONNAISSANCE OF THE
UPPER ARIARI RIVER REGION DEPARTMENT OF THE META, EASTERN
COLOMBIA. An archaeological survey of the upper Ariari River has recorded a total of 19
sites, the first ever reported for the Llanos Orientales of Colombia, an area of more than
150,000 sq mi. Sites are up tol 2 acres in areal extent, and in some cases, more than 3 ft In
depth. Large sites are confined to the Ariari floodplain. The unexpected size and depth of
the sites suggests long occupations by large, sedentary societies. This would conflict with
traditional interpretations of lowland South American prehistory which argue that except in
the floodplains of major rivers like the Amazon and Orinoco, social groups were small,
scattered and mobile. (45)
Matheny, Ray T., THE MOATED “FORTRESS” OF EDZNA, CAMPECHE, MEXICO. A
water moat system linked to a 12 km tong canal is currently under investigation. The
““fortress™ is about the same size as the site of Becan but contains only a few constructions
of the Late Preclassic and Early Classic periods. No significant Late Classic period
occupation exists with the main canal or moated structure. Water remains in the canal until
March at the present time and is a source of fish and other aquatic fife throughout the
winter. The “fortress” may or may not have functioned in Late Preclassic period military
operations. (38 A)

Mayer-Oakes, William J., AN OBSIDIAN SOURCE IN HIGHLAND ECUADOR. Recent
field investigations have located a major obsidian source at a high elevation in the eastern

Mehringer, Peter, C. N. Warren, and Austin Long, DUNE CHRONOLOGY, OCCUPATION,
AND RESOURCES, AMARGOSA DESERT, NEVADA. A 5300 yr radiocarbon dune
chronology has been established for Ash Meadows, Amargosa Desert, Nevada, by the dating
of interbedded marsh deposits. Periods of high local water tables and peat deposition are
dated at 5300-4700 B.P., 400-3500 B.P., and about 350 B.P. A significant period of
reduction to low retief, stability, and soll formation in dunes js dated bewteen 3000 B.P.
and 2000 B.P. Important dune resources, especially mesquite (Prosopis julifiora), are
controlled by the degree of dune stabilization; semi-stabilized dunes appear to be the most
productive. The archaeological chronology can be related to dune history and it is likely
that aboriginal utilization of the Amargosa Desert was influenced by this history. (12)
Matson, Richard G., and William D. Lipe, REGIONAL SAMPLING: A CASE STUDY. The
Cedar Mesa Project is an attempt to characterize the archaeology and environment of an
approximately 300 sq mi area of southeastern Utah on the basis of a sampling design.
Randomly selected watershed areas provide primary sampling units or clusters. Each cluster
is randomly sampled within specified strata by means of 400 m square quadrats. The
rationale for selecting this type of methodology will be stated. The sampling design will be
critically evaluated in light of the first season's work. Results of testing the main hypotheses
by non-parametric analysis of variance techniques will be given as well as confidence
intervals for the variables under investigation. Survey results will also be compared with
those generated by sampling simulation in a part of Cedar Mesa intensively surveyed prior to
the start of the present project. Finally, some general comments on problems of
multi-purpose archaeological regional sampling, and of selection of sites for excavation, will
be offered. (28)
Mauer, Michael D., STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS OF HIGH STATUS BURIALS FROM THE
PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST. A structural analysis of 2 “high status” burials (B. 140 from
Grasshopper, and B. 16 from the Ridge Ruin) is presented. High rank is inferred for these
individuals, which suggests that Pill and PIV societies were not egalitarian. Possible
symbolic continuity with Mesoamerican and ethnographically-known Pueblo societies is
explored. Comparisons with relevant Mesoamerican data are made. (18)
Meighan, Clement, RESEARCH VERSUS PEDAGOGY IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL FIELD-
WORK. The excavation of archaeological sites imposes a research obligation on the
excavator. Digging sites for student training creates a teaching obligation for the excavator.
Teaching and research obligations are not necessarily incompatible, but the procedures of
excavation must balance the 2 kinds of obligation, and this often requires handling a
“teaching” excavation in a somewhat different way than a purely “research” excavation.
Some of the practical and intellectual problems in this area of concern are discussed. (42)

MCKEAN COMPLEX CAMPSITE, LOGAN CO., COLORADO, The 1972 Colorado State
University Archaeological Field School excavated a McKean phase site on top of a butte in
the south facing escarpment system flanking the high plains in Logan County, Colorado.
Stratified fill in a rock shelter and on the butte indicated an intensive early Middle Period
occupation in association with bison bones, overlain by smaller quantities of later remains.
Cultural affiliations are strongest with an increasingly well known Plains Archaic complex
which includes the McKean type site in northwestern Wyoming, Signa! Butte | in western
Nebraska, the Kobald site in southern Montana, and other bison kill sites in the Powder
River Basin. (44)
Messer, Ellen, SOWN AND UNSOWN ASPECTS OF PRODUCTIVITY IN AGRI-
CULTURAL SYSTEMS IN THE VALLEY OF OAXACA, MEXICO. Agricultural systems of
Zapotec populations in the Vailey of Oaxaca, Mexico, are looked at from the point of view
of the entire cultivation system's contribution to the diet. The field systems studied are
briefly described. Then, 6 edible non-cultivated ‘‘weed"’ species are examined as integral
parts of the field systems. Cultural practices and attitudes which affect the growth and
utilization of these species are considered both from the subjective viewpoint of the Zapotec
population and the objective viewpoint of the botanist. Cultivation practices are shown to
contribute to an agricultural environment which supports “wild’’ plant populations of
nutritional value to the human populations, in addition to the sown cultigens. (1)

, Milanich, Jerald T., THE WESTERN TIMUCUA: PATTERNS OF ACCULTURATION AND
CHANGE, The western Timucuan tribes were the Utina, Yustega, Potano, and Ocale. The
Potano and Ocale shared the material culture of the Alachua archaeological tradition, while
the Yustega and Utina (and other Florida Indian tribes) shared the Leon-Jefferson complex.
To date the most intensive research has been on the Potano. Excavation of several
seventeenth century villages has provided information on forms and rate of Potano
acculturation. By interpreting this evidence in the context of known ethnohistorical
descriptions, general statements concerning mission Timucuan culture change can be made.
The ability of archaeological methods to detect short term culture change is also examined.

Miller, Arthur G., EXCAVATIONS AT TANCAH, QUINTANA ROO, MEXICO. For the
1972-73 field season of the Quintana Roo Mural Project sponsored by the Center for
Pre-Columbian Studies, Yate University, and The National Geographic Society, a series of
test excavations are projected for the immediate area around Structure 12 at the Post-Classic
Maya site of Tancah on the éast coast of Yucatan. The primary purpose of the excavation is
to gather ceramic and artifactural data for the dating of the mural associated with Tancah
Structure 12. The results of these excavations are reported; and architectural, mural, and :
ceramic data from Tancah and Tulum are compared so that their implications for the
archaeology of the east coast of Yucatan can be evaluated. (43)

UNIVERSAL EPIC OR NARROW NATIONALISM. Traditionally the Nuttall codex has
been considered a historical Mixtec document. Recently, however, Chadwick (1571) has :
found internal evidence suagesting that the Nuttall is a multi-lingual composition aimed ata
broadly based Mesoamerican audience. It is proposed here that the Nuttall is a historical and
literary commentary exhibiting both universal (pan-Mesoamerican) and specific (Mixtec)
symbolic content. A method is proposed and tested which is designed, through the
utilization of structural analytical tools, to retrieve symbol categories common to literate
members of the Mesoamerican megaculture as a whole while factoring out possible
nationalistic biases of the hypothesized Mixtec composers. (22)

Coulee Paleo-indian site recently has been endangered by irrigation overflow. Excavation
was renewed in 1972 with support of the National Park Service and the Bureau of
Reclamation. Initial occupation followed draining of a proglacial lake, during a cool moist
climatic regime. Later occupation coincided with abruptly decreasing precipitation. New
data pertains to fauna, microfauna, geomorphology, palynology, and lithic technology,
along with other archaeological aspects. Mathematical analysis by computer graphics has
aided this work. (7)
Montet-White, Anta, and Roger Grosser, APPLICATION OF FOURIER SERIES TO THE
TIME-TREND ANALYSIS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA. Most archaeological phe-
nomena can be expressed in the form of measurements; the distribution of these
measurements through time is assumed to approximate that of a normal curve. in many
cases, however, distributions do not fit the normal curve model but form series of more or
less regular oscillations. Fourier series is a technique directly applicable to the study of
oscillatory phenomena; it is used here in an attempt to recognize significant patterns of
distribution for non-normally distributed data. (39)

Moratto, Michael J.. ARCHAEOLOGICAL CAPS AND POLITICAL GOWNS: THE
RENNAISSANCE OF PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY IN CALIFORNIA. American archaeology
presently faces multiple crises: (1) vast stores of field data are annually destroyed by
accelerating land developments; (2) recent proliferation of excavations by high schools, 2
year colleges, and avocational groups has resulted in intensified data collection without
adequate provision for analysis, interpretation, or publication of findings; (3) the public
sector manifests its growing interest in the country’s cultural heritage by demanding more
popular and less technical archaeological reports; and (4) traditional university archaeology
programs are simply not prepared in terms of funding or facilities to coordinate
poly-institutional multi-disciplinary research on a regional basis. tn California, these related
problems are being met on 2 fronts through the establishment of regional “cooperatives”
and the creation of a “State Heritage Agency."' The nature and status of these programs will
be discussed in this paper. (31)

THE CASE AT HUANUCO PAMPA, The paper will consider the design of an excavation
strategy for an Inca city within the more general context of attempts to deal with the

architectural remains in sample stratification will receive special emphasis, and some of the
successes and shortcomings of the strategies we have employed at Huanuco Pampa will be
discussed on the basis of preliminary results. (28)
Morrison, Roger B., THE HOLOCENE GEOLOGIC-CLIMATIC RECORDS IN THE GREAT
BASIN AND IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FUTURE. Effects of climatic changes during the last
11.000-10,000 yr (the Holocene epoch) were intensified in the Great Basin because of the
severe continentality of this region. These effects are manifested by considerable
fluctuations in levels of ‘‘Pluvia!l lakes,”’ in details of geologic-sedimentary sequences of
various kinds, and in archaeological records of the human population. Nevertheless, the
Holocene changes were trivial compared to those of the Pleistocene. Evidence on several
fronts suggest that the warm interglacial climate of the Holocene either has already ended or
will end within several centuries and consequently with the ensuing glacial interval, mankind
soon will be subjected to climatic stress far more severe than any since Indo-European
civilization began ca. 6000 yr ago. (4)
Morse, Dan F., THE CAHOKIA MICROLITH INDUSTRY. Paleo-indian, Jaketown, and
Hopewell blade and core industries in the eastern United States have been widely Known for
2 decades or more, although normally only Hopewell cores and blades are discussed in the
literature. Other core and blade assemblages are now becoming known, such as the Cahokia .
microlith industry. Centered at the Cahokia site, located near St. Louis, characteristic cores, ,
blades, and tools have been recognized in Arkansas and Florida, possibly associated with a
frontier Mississippi culture. Apparent techniques of manufacture and hafting and probable
uses of tools are described. Manufacture may have involved the use of a vise, a grooved
potsherd. Hafting could have been accomplished by inserting a microlith into the end ofa
freshly cut cane. Microliths seem to have functioned mainly as gravers and drills. (38)
Moseley, E. M., LABOR ORGANIZATION IN LARGE SCALE CONSTRUCTION
PROJECTS. An examination of large scale building projects within the Moche Valley
implies that prehistoric, corporate labor forces were composed of discrete teams of
workmen each responsible for a specific task or distinct segment of construction. The
hypothesis is advanced that different work teams were drawn from distinct social units
obliged to fulfill a labor tax. (16)
Moseley, M. Edward, THE DEVELOPMENT OF URBANISM IN THE MOCHE VALLEY,
PERU. Evidence collected over 4 years of survey and excavation in the Moche Valley on the
north coast of Peru conclusively demonstrates that large scale urbanism was not introduced
into the valley during the Middié Horizon via the process of foreign invasion. Earlier
diffusionist models positing the foreign origin of urban residence are reviewed and shown to
be pseudo-explanative propositions based on inadequate survey and incorrect dating of large
prehistoric settlements. Wihtin the Moche Vailey the phenomenon of urban settlement
represents an internally consistent development firmly established by the beginning of the
Early Intermediate Period. (32)
Mountjoy, Joseph B., THE COLLAPSE OF THE CLASSIC AT CHOLULA, AS SEEN
FROM CERRO ZAPOTECAS., During 2 summers (19569 and 1970), study of prehispanic
land use on the eastern edge of Cholula revealed drainage of a fertile |jowland area during the
Preclassic-Classic transition, plus evidence that the area was abandoned during the terminal
Classic and Earty Postclassic. In 1971, attention was shifted to the nearest highland zone,
Cerro Zapotecas, to study changes in a different ecological setting. Surface sampling and
excavation yielded extensive representation of Late Classic-Early Postclassic transitional
material. The nature of this occupation and what it may reveal about factors involved in the
collapse of the Classic at Cholula are discussed. (27)
Mueller, James W., ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AS CLUSTER SAMPLING. The
thesis of this essay is that certain kinds of archaeological research conform to the definition
and process of cluster sampling. Cluster sampling is defined in terms of basic concepts—
element, sampling unit, and population—and is illustrated archaeologically. The differences
between cluster sampling and other methods—simple random, systematic, and stratified
sampling—are discussed. The implications of this thesis in hypothesis testing and statistical
inference are grave; significance levels based on cluster sampling are different from those
based on the other kinds of sampling. (28)

settlement in this area. Former estimates of population appear to have been too high, but

Muto, Guy, ATTRIBUTES OF TECHNOLOGY VERSUS ARTIFACTS OF CULTURE.
Recently we have come to better understand the mechanical principles of flintworking, and
through the work of Faulkner, Speth, Muiller-Beck can list those attributes of technology
which are mechanically constant as related to technique, i.€., the formation of “lips,
hackles, waliner tines, undulations, gullwings, radial striations,"’ and eraillures: yielding
“Information about platform orientation, fracture direction, stress intensity, stress direction
and perhaps others’ (E 1972). Formal typology has tong been a standard means of
investigation and recently modified by the use of metric analysis and the super toy ‘'The
Machine."’ However, there seems some confusion about what to measure and of what
significance it is once measured. The suggestion presented here is that technique and culture
equals technology, and that metric attributes must be wed to qualitative features to provide
a tool for the archaeologist. (2)
Muto, Guy R., LEVALLOIS BLADES IN THE OLD AND NEW WORLD. The recent
recognition of a Levallois-like technology in the New World has led to the discovery of ’

not been associated with polyhedral cores in the older assemblages. The technology which
lies behind this phenomenon is explored, (38)

O’Brien, Patricia J., A NEW SYNTHESIS OF STEED-KISKER (WESTERN MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPIAN) CULTURE. For the past 5 yr new research has resulted in sufficient data
with which to radically revise the accepted views of the nature, settlement pattern and social
structure of these people. The old view saw this system was one of small agricultural villages,
using the bison resources of the plains and having an unstratified and undifferentiated social
order. New hypotheses concerning these notions as well as demographic data are presented
here which suggest a settlement pattern of individual households (with 2 or 3 structures per
site) with some labor specialization. The population seems to be integrated via a common
mortuary area and ritual with probably only 6 to & Households represented per cemetery.
The implications of such a cultural pattern are examined in relationship with empirical data
to test the idea that Steed-Kisker culture originates from the Cahokia area and evolves or is
transformed into Nebraska culture. (44)
O'Connell, James F,, and Robert Bettinger, LITHIC ANALYSIS IN SETTLEMENT
STUDIES: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE NORTHERN GREAT BASIN. Prehistoric sites in
Surprise Valley, northeastern California, have been divided into several functional categories
on the basis of locational criteria and the formal character of artifact assemblages.
Reconstruction of activities at each site permits predictive statements about certain
characteristics of associated chipped stone tools, including edge angle values and edge
damage, and about the quantitative and qualitative aspects of variation among these
characteristics at different kinds of sites. Confirmation of these predictions through lithic
analysis supports the validity of the settlement model. The general implications of the
research for the reconstruction of prehistoric settlement and subsistence patterns are
discussed. (34)
Olsen, Stanley J., INTRODUCTION OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS INTO THE SOUTHWEST.
Most archaeologists agree that the only Gomestic animals known to the Indians of the
southwestern United States were the dog and turkey, prior to 1540. Between 1540 and the
Pueblo Revolt of 1680, stock raising became a part of the culture of a few southwestern
Indians. Some archaeological sites, particularly at Awatovi, Arizona, have yielded domestic
animal bones of a quantity sufficient to compare with known breeds today. The animals at
Awatovi as well as those of other points of introduction are discussed and illustrated. (18)
Olsen, Stanley J., ZOOARCHAEOLOGY IN THE ANTHROPOLOGY CURRICULUM. The
vaiue of the study of faunal remains as an aid toward interpreting an archaeological site is
rarely questioned but is rather accepted as aré many other interdisciplinary studies
(dendrochronology, pollen analysis, soil studies, etc.). How to best implement a course of
studies so as to be of the most importance to archaeologists and yet not duplicate programs
already offered by zoology or biology departments poses a few problems. The acquisition
and housing of required research materials also must be considered. The use of both
jaboratory and field methods of instruction must be correlated. These and related subjects
are discussed, giving examples of programs already in operation and how they have fared.

of this complex is discussed from the view of radiocarbon age determinations at both sites
and geological data at La Cumbre. From this an attempt is made to relate the Paijan
complex to other early lithic complexes in Andean South America both chronologically and
stylistically. (45)

CALIENTE OF GUERRERO. The analysis of the archaeological and ethnohistorical records
and of the ecological and modern data led to the construction of a model to account for the
cultural adjustments of the Tierra Caliente people to their geographically marginal position
in Mesoamerica. A pattern of constant movements of goods and people in and out of the
middle Balsas River Basin has been—in the past as well as today—the most successful
mechanism to reguiate the ecological situation and to maintain contact with the rest of
Mesoamerica. The nature of exterior influences (Olmec, Tarascan) is analyzed in this
context. (36)
Parsons, Jeffrey R., THE RISE AND DECLINE OF CLASSIC TEOTIHUACAN: SOME
IMPLICATIONS OF CHANGING REGIONAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE
VALLEY OF MEXICO. The delineation of regional settlement patterns between late
Formative and early Postclassic times (ca. 300 B.C.—A.D. 900) in the eastern and southern
Valley of Mexico indicates some marked changes in population distribution at the junctures
corresponding to the development and demise of the Teotihuacan state. This demographic
and distributional perspective suggests that there are at least 3 radically different settlement
systems which succeeded each other in time in this area: a later Formative, a Classic, and an
Early Postciassic. This paper attempts to offer a preliminary description of these 3 systems.

type-variety system has been advanced and largely accepted as an analytical method for
Mayan and other Mesoamerican pottery. Two recent and independent studies of the
Guangala complex of the south coast of Ecuador have been made, one employing the
type-variety method, the other the similiary, thus permitting valid comparisons between the
principles, procedures, and results, and the weaknesses and strengths of the 2 somewhat
differing methods. (26)
Payen, Louis A., CREVIS CREEK: NEW LIGHT ON THE FARMINGTON COMPLEX,
Chert cores and bifaces referable to the Farmington complex have been found in situ in
cemented gravels exposed along Crevis Creek in central California. Analysis of the geology,
landforms, and soils in the Crevis Creek valley established a series of fill terraces reflecting
cycles of aggradation and degradation thought to be linked to Pieistocene climatic shifts.
Tentative correlations are made with recently available studies of Quaternary landscape
evolution and stratigraphy for adjoining river valleys. Stratigraphic position of the artifact
bearing beds at both Crevis and Farmington suggest similar deposition histories and may
relate to Wisconsin glacio-eustatic events. Temporal and archaeological implications are
discussed. (15)
Phagan, Cari J., LITHIC DEBITAGE ANALYSIS, THE AYACUCHO VALLEY, PERU.
During 1971 and 1972, a computer-assisted attribute analysis system was designed to reveal
patterns in the specific technological processes of the manufacture of chipped stone
implement assemblages. The analysis system was applied to a sample of the materials from
the Ayacucho Valley, Peru. Emphasis was placed on the analysis of flakes and debitage in
defining technological complexes and their variability through the time period from 8000
B.C. to 2000 B.C. Both the analytic techniques and the derived information suggest that a
simplified version of the system may be useful in establishing technological “‘profiles’’ that
can be compared through time and space for their potential cultural significance. (2)

structures, and fragments of others, are known which date from this period contemporane-
ous with, or possibly earlier than, the construction of E-VilSub at Uaxactun. Some of this

Puleston, Dennis E., THE MANIPULATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES BY
HUMAN POPULATIONS AND SIGNIFICANT THRESHOLDS, In contrast to the highlands
of Mesoamerica it has often been stated that the tropical forest environment of the Maya
lowlands is essentially homogenous. This now appears to be an oversimplification of the
case. New evidence indicates that the resources of the sub-tropical forests of this region were
manipulated in a variety of dramatically distinct ways. This appears to have been in response
to variability in a number of specific environmental factors. Some o7 the food production
sub-systems resulting from this response include slash-and-burn agriculture, river levee
cultivation, kitchen gardens, and the cultivation of swamps by the construction of ridged
fields. Within each of these subsystems there are functional relationships between
productivity, population density, demography, settlement patterns, and some organizational
factors such as social and religious hierarchies, architectural achievement, etc. A model of
some of these relationships is presented in an attempt to discover significant thresholds. (1)
Puleston, Olga Stavrakis, CULTURAL VARIABILITY AS AN ADAPTIVE FACTOR IN
THE LOWLAND MAYA AREA. It is possible that variability even within small
communities is adaptive, providing alternatives for situations of environmental change and
thus helping maintain ecological stability. Thus, populations with a greater number of |
subsistence alternatives in their behavioral repertoire may have greater survival potential
than srwulathas with fewer alternatives. Upon examination of the food production
techniques and associated social institutions in the Peten, Guatemala, it was noted that (1)
there are a wide variety of food-producing techniques, (2) there is a variety of social
institutions to accommodate these techniques, and (3) there area number of uncommon or
aberrant practices which are “preserved” by a few individuals but may be utilized by a larger
portion of the populations in situations of environmental change. In light of these data and ;
examples drawn from the literature, the effect of variability upon the stability of the
ecosystem and the survival potential of the population ts examined. (1)

The Arrowhead Factory site (Mr 122), Marion County, Fiorida, was intensively and
extensively utilized, In 1970, an acre of this site was bulldozed by amateurs to a depth of 6 in
from which approximately 10,000 stone tools were recovered, and loaned to me for study.
in order to collect a representative sample of the chipping debris, discarded cores, and crude
implements which were of no interest to the amateur collectors, a backhoe trench 5 ft wide
and 160 ft long was dug. In addition to the amateurs’ collections, 65,000 stone remains
from this trench have been analyzed. A study of this kind contributes to our knowledge of
lithic techniques and to a greater understanding of the types of activities (other than stone
tool production) which took place at workshop sites. (2)
Quirarte, Jacinto, [ZAPAN AND MAYAN TRAITS IN TEOTIHUACAN It! POTTERY.
Present research demonstrates that the Xolaipan vessels found by Linne (1934) and used by
Vaillant (1938) to characterize Teotihuacan II! pottery, are actually non-Teotihuacan in
style. The iconographic programs and the use of a vertical rather than horizontal format
50
, clearly point to Chiapas-Guatemala highland sources. A study of these vessels and other
Teotihuacan mould made pottery fragments with Maya figural and narrative programs
(reproduced by Linne 1934 and Sejourne 1963) will further elucidate the role played by
izapan and Mayan artists in the development of Teotihuacan art. (5)

Rattray, Evelyn C., CERAMIC EVIDENCE ON THE COLLAPSE OF THE CLASSIC AT .
TEOTIHUACAN. Recently, 25 small-scale, extremely detailed excavations were carried out
by archaeologists of the Teotihuacan Mapping Project. The majority show strong Metepec
(Teotihuacan 1V) occupation occasionally overlain by deposits of the subsequent peoples
that occupied the site. Data from excavations and surface survey have modified the picture
of a drastic reduction in population during Metepec times and clarified the relationships
between Metepec and the immediately succeeding phase. The revised ceramic chronology
provides a more solid foundation for understanding the processes involved, in the decline of
Teotihuacan. (27)
Raymond, J. Scott, SOME SPECULATIONS ON THE ECONOMIC IMPORTANCE OF THE
UPPER MONTANA OF PERU TO PREHISTORIC ANDEAN CIVILIZATIONS. The
importance of the forested eastern slopes and vaileys of the Andes to the central Andean
civilizations has been repeatedly deemphasized by archaeologists and anthropologists. Some
have argued that the rugged terrain and dense vegetation of the ceja prevented the highland
peoples from conquering, colonizing, or otherwise exploiting this vast region to the east.
Archaeological and historical data from the montana and sierra of the Department of
Ayacucho are used to support a theory that there was repeated colonization of selected
areas of the montana during the later prehistoric and historic periods of Peruvian prehistory.
The Middle Horizon is suggested as the possible time for the onset of such colonizations.

issues involved in regional sampling, such as the relationship between the question asked

hypothesis testing, and the merits of different types of sampling designs. (28)
Redman, Charles L., PRODUCTIVE SAMPLING STRATEGIES FOR ARCHAEOLOGICAL
SITES. There are numerous steps in the archaeological investigation of individual sites which
can be made more efficient and reliable if a sampling strategy is employed. These include
the initial surface collecting of the site, wall clearing When applicable, areas or rooms to be
excavated, samples of soil to be screened or floated, and selection of levels and artifacts to
be analyzed in detail. In all types of sampling it is necessary to make important decisions
which are influenced by the expedition's goals, resources, the researcher's understanding of
the archaeological material, and his knowledge of sampling design. Questions of sampling
procedure, stratification of the population to be sampled, size of the sampling unit, and
proportion of population to be sampled must be evaluated in such a way as to maximize
usable results and not to carry on sampling for its own sake. (28)

PROSPECTS. Agricultural practices of Neolithic societies have been treated on various
planes by prehistorians. In some instances they have been virtually ignored in model
construction; in others, detailed descriptions of fossil agricultural systems have played an |
important part in understanding cultural stability or change. It is argued here that a
significant body of data relating to Hawaiian agricultural practices can be obtained through
archaeological methods. The problems of agricultural reconstruction and its implications are

is a preliminary analysis of the investigation of a construction unit (a group of contiguous
rooms) that was dug In total at Grasshopper (Ariz. P:14:1), during the 3 field seasons of
1970, 1971, and 1972. The report defines the concept of construction unit and its
interrelation with the physical pueblo and then demonstrates its validity while probing into
the possible related social behavioral unit that might have constructed the rooms and later
lived in them, The project has 2 major thrusts: first, to demonstrate the existence of
architectural units larger than a single room, and second, to investigate the social behavior
correlated with the physical unit—the construction unit. (18) |
Roe, Peter G., THE PANOAN AFFILIATIONS OF THE CUMANCAYA COMPLEX. Recent
stratigraphic excavations at the site of Cumancayacocha, UCA-22, in the Peruvian montana
have recovered a large sample of the Cumancaya ceramic industry. It exhibits many points
of affinity with the pottery produced by modern Panoan-speaking riverine groups like the
Shipibo-Conibo and the most developed ceramics of the inter-fluvial Panoans, those of the
Cashinahua. In addition to these shared characteristics, a specific implement used in the
ethnographically recorded ani shreate female puberty ceremony was recovered from the
Cumancaya midden. Since this ceremonial complex is an exciusive Panoan trait, the
artifact’s discovery, along with the other ceramic data, presents a good indirect argument for
the Panoan linguistic affiliations of the Cumancaya complex. (30)

Rohn, Arthur H., HOW WELL CAN WE SAMPLE ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES? Archae-
ological sarnpling procedures can be properly evaluated only by their abilities to predict the
natures of the universes from which the samples are derived. Total excavation of the
Gilliland site, a seventh century Basket Maker i111 settlement in southwestern Colorado,
using a 2 m square grid permits an evaluation of several possible sampling procedures.
Subjective selection of major features, trenching, artifact density plots, and selection of
excavation squares by random numbers all would fail to predict significant settlement
characteristics. (28)
Rosendahl, Paul, ABORIGINAL AGRICULTURE AND RESIDENCE IN UPLAND
LAPAKAHI, ISLAND OF HAWAII. Recent research has defined an extensive dryland
agricultural adaptation based on swidden cultivation of sweet potato and dryland taro on an
intensive scale involving permanent field units. Representing an endpoint of agricultural
development comparable only to the irrigated pondfietd systems found in wet vaileys,
Lapakahi has several important implications for investigating the course of prehistoric
cultural development in Hawaii. Utilizing an agricultural model emphasizing intensification
as the principal process influencing agricultural growth and development, the Lapakahi
investigations suggest that intensification of the agricultural system might well exemplify
responses to complex socio-political pressures rather than simple population increase
pressures alone. (10)

Sanford, Patricia R.,. A COMPARISON OF POLLEN ANALYTICAL DATA FROM FECAL
AND SOIL SAMPLES: SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOGY. Human or other
animal coprolites from archaeological sites are often subjected to pollen analysis in an
attempt to learn something of the diet and ultimately the subsistence economy and
environment of prehistoric peoples. No direct comparisons have been made between pollen
analytical data derived from fecal material and the same data derived from soil samples. In
the past, the assumption has been that data from soil samples yield macro-environmental
interpretations, while data from fecal samples yield micro-environmental interpretations.
This assumption is tested with analyses of modern fecal, and associated soil, samples of bear,
deer, and elk and with archaeological fecal materials of putative human origins from a cave |
in eastern Oregon. (33)

Scholtz, Sandra, and Robert Chenhall, NETWORKS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA
BANKS. The behavioral models which are the theoretical result of the analysis of
archaeological data depend upon the availability of data to archaeologists. Some system
which would facilitate the dissemination and exchange of information would seem desirable.
A network of archaeological information exchange could function theoretically at a number
of different levels, including: a tightly controlied common data bank system; a decentralized
system which required no more than standardization of terminology and definitions; or a
system which supplied only advice concerning computerizing and analyzing data. An
evaluation of the practicality and/or desirability of the alternatives for research in
archaeology necessitates an examination of the nature of and extent of the use of
archaeological) data for research purposes; the structure of the network itself should not
restrict or dictate the structure of the research applications of the available data. (3)
Schuyler, Robert L., PRE AND POST-INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY AND ARCHAEOLOGY AS
THE SCIENCE OF MATERIAL CULTURE. A number of archaeologists have recently
discussed and in some cases called for a redefinition of archaeology as the scientific study of
material culture irrespective of temporal position in contrast to the implicit traditional
definition that would limit the field to the study of past societies. Such a redefinition seems
to produce a number of serious problems; problems which, however, are only relevant toa
“Looking Backward Attitude.” tf in contradistinction an evolutionary perspective is
assumed, with industrial society being one of several developmental stages, then archaeology
is in a position to make vital contributions to the study of modern society. tn turn, such
studies are predestined to have extensive and positive impact on the total discipline of
archaeology. (9)
Shafer, Harry J., DEBITAGE ANALYSIS AND REDUCTION SYSTEMS AT THE
GEORGE Cc. DAVIS SITE, TEXAS. Analysis of lithic debitage at the Davis site revealed that
local tithic reduction strategies varied with respect to the raw material classes (flint,
Quartzite, silicified wood) which occurred in pebble and small cobble form. More
importantly, findings demonstrated that many artifacts of non-local materials were not
made at the site. However, one non-local resource, a natural glass, was brought to the site in
nodular state. These data have aided significantly in testing propositions about the Davis site
Caddoan cultural system and the scope of its interaction sphere. (2)
Sharp, Rosemary, ARCHITECTURE AS INTER-ELITE COMMUNICATION IN PRE-CON-

that within a particular society great art is produced only when people having diverse
interests and goals feel the need to communicate on an emotional level, in order to promote
cooperation toward economic, political, or social ends. Striking similarities in the
architectural decoration of monumental public buildings in Veracruz, Oaxaca, and Yucatan
during Late Classic and Postclassic times suggests, first, that this theory can be extended to
inter-societal relationships on an elite level, and, second, that the “‘greca”™ style functioned in
a similar manner for participating and contributing peoples and cultures. (13)

PANAMA. An archaeological project investigating the Barriles chiefdom, Chiriqui Province,

6000 ft, dates to ca. A.D. 300. The results of the analysis of lithic tools and wastage indicate
the existence of 2 separate industries: flake tools and celts. The flake industry seems to bea
household or cottage industry, directed toward the production of general cutting tools. The
used flakes, wastage, and cores from this industry were encountered at all sites. Celts, on the
other hand, were manufactured and resharpened onty at the major sites. Celt manufacture

Sheffer, Charles, FOOD PROCUREMENT IN A SEMI-ARID PLAIN: A PROGRAMMED
MODEL. The model is designed as a dynamic simulation of a food procurement system
based on non-mechanized gravity irrigation cultivation in a semi-arid alluvial plain. Such
systems formed the economic base for early states in places like Mesopotamia, the Nile
valley, and the Indus valley. Yield in such an agricultural system is determined primarily by
environmental factors and secondarily by human agricultural practices. Utilizing methods
developed by agricultural science and hydrology, the model generates agricultural yields
under various combinations of environmental conditions and agricultural practices. These
yields (with minor supplements from hunting and gathering) are used to predict the
maximal enduring population which the area of application could sustain. Investigation can
be made of the responses of agricultural yields and population to changes in the ;
environment or in agricultural techniques, organization, or labor utilization. Oscillations in
the system (l.e., temporal or spatial variation in key variables) are noted. The model is
intended to aid in Understanding the food procurement system which formed the economic
base of early states in alluvial plains. (24) |
Sidrys, R. V., TRADE tNDICES FOR UTILITARIAN IMPORTS OF THE CLASSIC
MAYA, It is suggested that the methodologies of recent models of Classic Maya exchange
systems contain several sources of significant error. These include the use of artifact counts
rather than artifact mass, and the neglect of artifact behavioral context and total excavation
volume. in an alternative method, a trade index is presented that quantifies the magnitude
of Maya utilitarian import volume per site. This trade index is the product of 2 variables,
import density, and source distance. Specific utilitarian import data from several Maya sites
are indexed by this method. (21)

suggested the hypothesis that it was a valued trade import that was not equally available to
all potters. Changes in its distribution may thus serve as an indicator of major shifts in
trading patterns. (36)

various core forms and the blades derived from them, and second, the identification of tools
produced on or from the various blade forms. Examples from both surface and sub-surface
samples collected at the sites of Cuauhtitilan (Valley of Mexico) and Amapa (Nayarit, west
Mexico) are provided for examination by symposium participants. Special attention is paid

Sinoto, Yosihiko H., POLYNESIAN OCCUPATIONS ON PITCAIRN AND HENDERSON
ISLANDS, SOUTHEAST PACIFIC. A round-ended rectangular dwelling pit was uncovered
on Pitcairn island. it was constructed and used before A.D. 1360+105. A shelter on
Henderson island, known as an uninhabited raised atoll, yielded evidence of human
occupation for 300 yr after A.D. 1160+110 before the settlers left; they had vanished from
the island by the time the Spanish arrived in A.D. 1606. If the major dispersal in East
Polynesia occurred from the Marquesas between A.D. 600 and A.D. 1200, it seems probable
that Polynesians made landings on both Pitcairn and Henderson during that time. Especially
Henderson was most likely discovered and occupied by the Marquesans. (40)

tradition; II, Initial Coalescent Variant; ti!, Post-Contact Coalescent Variant; 1V, Historic
Dakota. Fifty bell-shaped cache pits, all filled with trash, are attributable to the 2
Coalescent components. No pits of any Kind are attributable to Plains Woodland. Shallow
basin shaped pits are attributable to Historic Dakota. The dimensions, cultural affiliations,
and locations of the 50 bell-shaped pits were coded and punched on IBM cards. The results
indicate that dimensions vary in relation to components and in whether or not the pits
were found within or outside of dwellings. Also, it would appear that more bell-shaped pits
were used in the Initial Coalescent variant than in the Post-Coalescent variant. (44)

Florida and their contact and interrelationships with the Florida and Georgia Indians. The
time period includes that from Ponce de Leon’s voyage, A.D. 1513, to A.D. 1800. The
initial contact, aside from discovery, appears to be that of procuring slaves. The main reason
for the Spanish interest in Florida was military and protection of its trade routes. In order
to attain tndian support, as allies as well as a means of foodstuffs and conversion of the
indians to Christianity, 2 mission chains were established. The initial mission chain extended
into the Guale area of the present state of Georgia and was maintained by the Jesuits. Later,
the St. Augustine-Fort San Luis chain was established and maintained by the Franciscans.

Spath, Cari D., TOWARDS A MODEL FOR THE EMERGENCE OF INTENSIVE
AGRICULTURE AND COMPLEX SOCIETY. The most complete record of ancient
botanical remains for the Andean region comes from the desert coast of Peru. There is little
argument that the appearance here of specific cultigens and agricultural systems, though no
doubt dependent on internal factors, was in response to more advanced systems external to
it. A number of lines of evidence point to the tropical forest areas east of the Andes as an
important source area for innovative development. tn line with this suggestion, a model of
development has been formulated with particular attention to the nature and characteristics
of tropical root crops. The groundwork of this model lies in a fundamental modification and
elaboration of the economic model of agricultural development presented by Boserup
(1965) and tentatively applied to the developmental sequence of the coast of Peru by
Patterson (1971). Attempts to apply this model in a truly developmental perspective have
made it clear that levels of intensification of production are intimately interdependent with
equivalent levels of intensification in the socio-political sphere. Thus the model proposes
roughly equivalent ‘‘stages’’ in both domains on the assumption that economic and political
intensification are integral features of the same process of change. Furthermore, | propose
that political intensification tends, in most cases, to precede and precipitate the related
economic changes. Population pressure, although indirectly generating causes for these
changes, is more important in that population must reach threshold values of density for
intensification to be effectively instituted. (32)

data from the study of the Hopi and the Hopi-Tewa, of northern Arizona (A.D. 1400-1970)
are briefly discussed concerning such settlement and settlement abandonment, problems as
functionalism, priestly orders, water and tand conflicts, local warfare, disease and health,
invading groups, and economic pressures; while internal variation in any settlement may be
due to rapid clan extinctions (in 50 yr or tess), creation of new clans, clans using other clan's
land or houses, emigration and disruption of ceremonial cycles, and exchange of craftsmen

understanding of several Neolithic occupations both in terms of their respective temporal
relationships and the factors inducing their settlement distributions. Our analysis used
radiocarbon dating and a number of multivariate and other statistical methods. As a result
a more refined absolute chronology was obtained, permitting a much better assessment of
the processes which produced the human geography of this area. (23)

Struever, Stuart, MODERN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH STRATEGIES THROUGH
THE PERSPECTIVE OF WPA ARCHAEOLOGY. This paper will use the WPA archaeologi-
cal projects as the basis for reflecting on the organizational needs—and capabilities—ot
archaeology then and now. To what extent were the institutions, within which archaeology
was conducted at the time, able to meet the salvage archaeology needs created by the public
works projects of the 1930's? How does the failure to meet some of these needs reflect,
more broadly, the failure of archaeology then and now to organize adequate manpower,
expertise, and funds to conduct large-scale, long-term fieldwork? It will be argued in this
paper that the history of the artifact assemblages collected by the WPA salvage projects
reflects, in a microcosm, general limitations within the archaeological community in its
ability to recover, process, curate, and analyze archaeological materials. (14)
Sussmang Robert W., PREAGRICULTURAL MOBILITY—A FACTOR LIMITING
GROWTH IN HUMAN POPULATIONS. in gorillas, the spacing of births 3.5 to 4.5 yr apart
is an important factor in limiting population growth. Such spacing seems to be a
consequence of the long period of infant dependency and the need to carry the dependent
infant while the troop is moving. tn this paper, | suggest that a similar factor was important
in checking human population growth in preagricultural times. In hunting and gathering
populations, in which it is necessary to move constantly in order to obtain food, there will
be limits on the number of children a woman can rear in her lifetime. | assume that in
non-sedentary populations a woman, in most cases, must transport a child for at least 4 yr
and that during this period she cannot nurture more than 1 child. Within this period, when
needed, social spacing mechanisms were probably employed. However, once human groups
became sedentary, these social spacing mechanisms were no longer a necessity. A woman |
could have and support a child as soon as an earlier one was weaned and the spacing
between children allowed to reach maturity decreased. Thus, it is hypothesized that the
increase in the human population in Neolithic times Was as much due to the acquisition of
sedentary habits as to changes in subsistence techniques. (1)

poorly trained,” But the truth of the matter is that archaeologists are, as indeed they must
be, paleo-psychologists . . . and this includes Binford as well as the rest of us. (17)
Thomas, David Hurst, THE BASIN | SIMULATION MODEL: TOWARD ARTICULATING
ETHNOLOGICAL THEORY WITH ARCHAEOLOGICAL FACTS. This paper considers the
more pragmatic aspects of the BASIN | computer simulation model. BASIN | was a
semi-quantitative and primitive attempt to translate Julian Steward's theory of historic
Great Basin Shoshonean settiement patterns into a set of archaeologically testable
propositions. As with most simulations of this sort, the BASIN | model was severely
restricted by the existing ethnographic reporting (especially with regard to material culture),
by an imperfect grasp upon the behavior of critical environmental parameters and by the
general lack of adequate controls to check how well the simulation runs mirror reality."
This paper also discusses the procedures necessary in this particular case to articulate
archaeological field data with the computer output. (24)
Thomas, Davis Hurst, THE “HOW,"" “WHY,” AND “SHOULD-HAVE-BEEN” OF
SAMPLING IN THE REESE RIVER ECOLOGICAL PROJECT. Most of the fieldwork of
the Reese River Ecological Project involved a sampling of the surface archaeological debris
within a single valley system of central Nevada. Because almost no pragmatic guidelines for
such sampling existed in 1968 when the research design was initially contrived, the effort
was (and is) viewed largely as a shot-in-the-dark, a first approximation. A 10% stratified
unequal cluster sampling technique was applied, using individual archaeological sites as
sampling units, 500 m square tracts as clusters and modern vegetational lifezones as strata.
In all, 140 such tracts were surveyed by a field crew which averaged about 34 individuals;
this fieldwork required nearly 12 weeks. In other words, the field operations alone
consumed more than 2000 man-days. The advantages, disadvantages, and cost of that
sampling attempt are evaluated, with suggestions for improving subsequent work. (28)
Thomas, David Hurst, MICROWEAR STUDIES ON SOME ETHNOGRAPHIC NORTH
AMERICAN HAFTED STONE TOOLS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS. This working paper
presents some preliminary findings of microwear investigation on 2 categories of
ethnographic stone tools from North America. Several microscopic techniques have been
utilized including variable wave-length lighting and scanning electron microscopy. Over 100
hafted Eskimo end scrapers were examined for consistent microwear patterns, and some
correlations seem to emerge between function, edge angle, and stone type. In addition, a
number of historic Plains Indian arrows and spears were studied to determine what sorts of
wear, ifany, appear on thrusting implements. If a consistent “random baseline” can be
established, then further progress can be made toward separating prehistoric knives from
blanks, from projectile points. (20)
Thomas, George B., DEMONSTRATING THE POT-HUNTER FACTOR: UNCON-
TROLLED, SELECTIVE TREASURE-HUNTING, AND CONTROLLED SURFACE
COLLECTION NEAR MITLA, OAXACA, Recent work by McGimsey, Clewlow, and others
makes clear the abundant potentials of public education concerning the crises in
archaeology. Much as an applied anthropologist presents a mutually intelligible demonstra-
tion of the advantages or disadvantages of a program, an archaeologist can demonstrate the
harmful effects of pot-hunting. Clewlow et al. (1971) did this by comparing pot-hunter
collections with archaeological control collections in Nevada, and by publishing such results
for popular consumption. Similarly, rudiments of a quantifiable and qualitative *‘pot-hunter
factor’ may be discerned following anatysis of amateur and professional surface collections
at an obsidian workshop site near Mitla, Oaxaca. (39)
Thomas, Prentice M., Jr., SETTLEMENT PATTERN SURVEY AT BECAN, CAMPECHE,
MEXICO, During the spring of 1972 a National Geographic Society-University of Tennessee
expedition led by this writer inaugurated the first season of prehistoric settlement study at
Becan in the Rio Bec region of Yucatan. Clearing operations and mapping of remains of
prehistoric domestic structures netted a total of over 1300 mounds or structures within the
several square kilometers immediately surrounding Becan. First season results confirm a
57
, surprisingly large, densely settled population radiating from Becan. Also, settlement remains
at Becan seem unlike those previously reported from the Maya area in 2 respects. The survey
turned up over 600 very small artificial mounds which surely served non-residential
functions. Second the project tocated a series of variable sized artificia) ridges for which
several functions seem possible. (13)
Townsend, Joan B., EIGHTEENTH AND NINETEENTH CENTURY ESKIMO AND
INDIAN MOVEMENTS IN SOUTHWESTERN ALASKA. A hypothesis regarding ethnic
identities of peoples and population movements during the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries is developed from oral traditions, historical manuscripts, and archaeology. It is
suggested that the current distribution of Tanaina Athapaskans and Agieqmiut Eskimos in
the Hiamna Lake and interior regions of southwestern Alaska is a recent phenomenon.
Tanaina penetrated the interior to the Stony and Kuskokwim Rivers in response to Russian
fur trading stimulus while Aglegmiut moved into the Iliamna region impinging on Tanaina
territory in response to inter-tribal hostilities elsewhere as well as the fur trade and slaving
practices. (40)
True, D. L., ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN NORTHERN CHILE: PROJECT ;
TARAPACA. Archaeological investigations in northern Chile over the past several years have
resulted in the recovery of data that bear significantly on preceramic cultural developments
in that region. A hypothesis is proposed that accounts for the extant settlement patterns in
this region prior to 1000 B.C, These settlements are discussed in terms of the regional
subsistence potential and data recovered from 5 separable cultural contexts that fall within
this time period. (16)
Tuggle, H. David, MODELS OF AGRICULTURAL GROWTH IN ISLAND ENVIRON-
MENTS. Postulated increases in production pressure in pre-European Hawaii are considered
in terms of theories of agricultural growth, particularly those of Brookfield, Boserup, and
Geertz. Agricultural system responses are expressed as expansion versus intensification
alternatives within natural and social isiand environments. Examples of generated
archaeological models are presented, The testing emphasis is placed upon the elimination of
theoretical models rather than on the identification of patterns suggested by ethnographic
models. (10)
Tuohy, Donald R., A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF LATE PALEO-INDIAN MANIFESTA-
TIONS IN THE WESTERN GREAT BASIN. One of the problems in the study of Desert
West archaeology is the identification of Late Paleo-indian manifestations in the Great
Basin, and how these relate, jf at all, to Plains-based Paleo-Indian groups of ca, 9500 B.C. to
6000 6.C. This paper summarizes and compares data from several surface and excavated
sites located in the central and western Great Basin, and attempts a taxonomic ordering of
these cultures or complexes based upon similarities and differences in stoneworking
technology, as well as certain site features, and other data. (15)
Turnbull, Harold F., and R. E. Taylor, DIRECT DATING OF FOSSILS BY AMINO ACID
ANALYSIS. Amino acids in living tissue each degrade to simpler compounds at a
characteristic rate after the death of the organism. These degradation rates provide a
potentially valuable chronometric indicator. The age of a fossil can be determined by
measuring the ratio of living state amino acids to respective degradation products and
employing the appropriate reaction rate constants. The feasibility of the method has been
tested on a series of east African fossil elephant teeth ranging in radiometric age from 22
million to 5Q00 years. The amino acid dates thus far determined are discussed in comparison |
to accepted radiometric dates. (39)
Varner, Dudley M., and Richard N. Belding, ARCHAEOLOGY AND POST-CONQUEST
SITES IN THE VALLEY OF GAXACA, MEXICO. Following the example of Charleton in
the Teotinuacan Valley, studies have begun of ceramic technology, market systems and
settlement patterns during the Colonial and Republic periods of the Valley of Oaxaca. Rural
structures including haciendas and mills have been surveyed. Many are unoccupied and offer
locales of productive excavations. In addition, colonial roads and Indian town sites
abandoned in the historic period have been located. Their characteristics have important
implications for the study of prehispanic settlement patterns. Continued archaeological
investigations, coordinated with those of ethnography and ethnohistory, will increase our
knowledge of aboriginal Oaxaca cultures and effects of the Spanish conquest on them. (35)
Vivian, R. Gwinn, and Robert C. Buettner, PRE-COLUMBIAN ROADWAYS IN THE
CHACO CANYON REGION, NEW MEXICO. Recently a series of prehistoric roads and
associated features including rock-cut and masonry stairways, ramps, and a bridge have been
“rediscovered” in the Chaco Canyon area of New Mexico. These roadways form a network
linking Chacoan towns and tying outlying colonies to a possible nuclear center in Chaco
Canyon. Several hypotheses have been advanced for explaining the function of this
non-Anasazi phenomenon including use for military movements and for ceremonial
functions. The hypothesis that this network served to facilitate the movement of goods or |
services is considered. (36) |

shell mounds located on the Pacific littoral southwest of Esquintla, Chiapas. The mounds,
forming islands of dry land in a mangrove swamp environment, are formed of large
concentrations of the marsh clam, Polymesoda spp. Previous investigators reported
nonceramic strata underlying ceramic strata. The study focuses on the lower material, in
order to reconstruct the prehistoric culture of these early coastal peoples. (43)
Wagner, Erika, CULTURAL RELATIONSHIPS AND CHRONOLOGY OF SOME UN-
CLASSIFIED PHASES IN WESTERN VENEZUELA, Archaeological excavations of the El
Jobal and Los Banos sites of the Valera-Agua Viva region (State of Trujifio) will be related
with some ceramic phases, so far unclassified, such as Betijoque, on the basis of stylistic
comparisons and Carbon-]14 dates. These phases of the hot and dry tierra caliente
environment will be compared with the Tierra templada and tierra fria Zones. The new data
will further clarify the culture history of the Intermediate area. (45)
Wallace, Owight T., and Robert Carmack, STYLE AND STATE IN PERU: A SUGGESTED
STRUCTURALIST APPROACH. Taking a broad, structural view of style, it is possible to
postulate the presence of a style tradition running throughout Peruvian prehistory. Its
validity rests on internal structure, but also on its historical reality. It contrasts with a
northern (Chavin-Moche), southern highland (TiahUanaco-Wari), and southern coastal
(Paracas-Nasca) tradition. Given its similarity with tropical forest traditions, it may
represent the older central Andean tradition. Regarding possible socio-political correlations,
the history of the tradition suggests broad patterns of interaction and movement, with
underlying themes such as a highland-coast dichotomy, an old passive versus new aggressive
patterns, and broad underlying patterns contrasting with the multiplicity of states and
reflecting on the formation and interaction of political units. (13)

| Weigand, Phillip C., TRADE PATTERNS FOR TURQUOISE IN MESOAMERICA AND
SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. Employing the technique of neutron activation,
described at the 1972 SAA annual meeting, we have analyzed a substantially increased
number of samples representing aboriginal quarries both of chemical and cultural
“turquoise.”’ ‘‘Turquoise” artifacts of known provenience have been examined and the
elementary compositions compared to those of the sources already studied. The results offer
some quantification of the aboriginal trade routes for this rare resource. (21)
Weymouth, John W., and Marnie Mandeville, X-RAY DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS OF
HEAT TREATED CHERT. In order to elucidate the microscopic changes involved in heat
treating chert an X-ray diffraction analysis was done on samples of chert heated to different
temperatures. In each case as higher temperatures were utilized the X-ray diffraction lines
became significantly broader. This is interpreted to mean that heating causes the extent of
microscopic crystalline order to decrease or that the chert becomes more glassy-like. In fact
it is possible to quantify the extent of this decreasing short range order in each case. The
x-ray diffraction technique used and the significance of the results with respect to tool
technology will be discussed. (20)
Whalen, Norman M., DELAYED ACCEPTANCE OF AGRICULTURE IN THE SOUTH-
WEST. Maize agriculture entered the Southwest during the Chiricahua stage of the Cochise
culture about 200 B.C., but it did not become widespread until a century or two before the

. time of Christ. tn the light of general systems theory, it is proposed that mutagenic changes
in maize ted to the adoption of maize agriculture on a wide scale by the San Pedro Cochise,
with effects on other aspects of their culture culminating in their transformation into early
Mogollon. (41)
Whalion, Robert, Jr... ARCHAEQLOGICAL TRAINING IN COMPUTER APPLICATIONS
AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS. Basic training in quantitative methods of data analysis
and the use of the computer in archaeological research is offered in an advanced seminar.
The stress is on the mastery of relatively simple statistics, computer use, and on developing a
good Understanding of the actual mechanisms or manipulations involved, Specific attention
is given to the fitting of quantitative methods to archaeological problems. The basic premise
is that Understanding of the above will enable the student to make appropriate choices of
quantitative procedures in particular research situations, The approach of this course is
frequently eye-opening for students who begin to see “all sorts of possibilities’’ for
analyzing archaeological data. The content and structure of the course are described, and its
potential and place in the graduate training program are evaluated. (42)

ANALYSIS OF PATTERNS OF PREHISTORIC WARFARE, Drawing from current research
in the Chevelon drainage area, Arizona, a number of interrelated problems of method and
logistics related to an explanation of prehistoric warfare will be discussed. While
archaeologists recognize the importance of understanding the “social environment” of the
cultural unit or units under investigation, emphasis is Usually placed on the more easily

59

SITE DEVELOPMENT. Preliminary archaeo-chemical data from North American archae-
ological sites suggest that the interaction of cultural and environmental factors in site

equations yields precise analysis of occupation history for any given site, and permits
reconstruction of degree and rate of change of both culture and environment through time.

Wilke, P. J, RECENT LARGE-SCALE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE IN THE SALTON
BASIN, CALIFORNIA, Presently much concern rests on the archaeological implications of
environmental changes in arid western North America. Frequently research aimed at
environmental changes dwells on the reality of paleo-climatic events, The Salton Basin of
eastern California underwent a change from aquatic to xeric conditions in the absence of
slanificant climatic changes within the past 500 yr. Preliminary data on adaptations before
and after the change, and the implications of the change, are presented. (31)
Wilkerson, S. Jeffrey K., PRE-COLUMBIAN SUB-CULTURE AREAS OF THE MEXICAN
GULF COAST. Archaeological and historical literature frequently proposes or assumes 4
static bipartite or tripartite cultural division of the general Veracruz area in prehispanic
times. Recent archaeological and ethnohistorical research in north-central Veracruz strongly
suggests a twofold division in the Early Formative period that becomes fourfold by the Late
Classic and Post-Classic periods. These subculture areas are seen as non-static entities both
in terms of ethnicity and parameters. However, the areas do correspond to significant
ecological, geographical, and social factors of a developmental nature. (35)

TAMPA BAY. Excavations at a shallow shel! midden on Tampa Bay reveal the extent of
utilization of several econiches for food. Over 30 species of shellfish have been identified
and are associated with various fresh, brackish, and salt water econiches. Faunal and floral
remains also indicate the extent of the utilization of land resources. (41)

QUANTITATIVE APPROACH. Several controlled experiments were carried out to
determine if substratum and other variables affected the degree to which unmodified stone

suggest that several factors are responsible for edge damage of this type and these
controlling variables can be differentiated. Implication and proposed future research are
discussed. (2)
Wing, Elizabeth S., THE ROLE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS IN THE ANDES. The native
domestic animais—iiamas, alpacas, guinea pigs, and dogs-—each play a number of roles in the
lives of people of the Peruvian Andes, Data from archaeological excavations augmented by
ethnographic information are being used to define these roles and outline changes in the use
of these animals throughout time. Three distinctive patterns of animal use are identifiable:
the early (before about 2000 B.C.) high valley (between 2000 and 4000 m elevation) use of
guinea pigs and dogs; the high puna (over 4000 m elevation) almost exicusive use of lamoids;
and in more recent times (since about 1000 B.C.) increased use of herding animals in the
high valley economy. (41)
Wiseman, Frederick, THE ARTIFICIAL RAINFOREST: A MODEL FOR OPTIMUM
PRODUCTIVITY IN LOWLAND MAYA AGRICULTURE. A possible alternative to Milpa
or Ramon cultivation is the creation of a system simulating the highly efficient
Mesoamerican rainforest, which stresses simultaneous cultivation of root crops, shrubs, and
trees. A combination of selective clearing and shortened fallow cycle will eventually result.
The simulated rainforest would be productive as well as stable over time due to chemical
plant defenses, heterogeneity, and availability of alternative paths for energy flow. The
cultural implications include the necessity for organizing large labor forces at given times,
external trade in valuable woods and chemicals, and use of the ritual calendar for recording
information on crops with life cycles measured in decades. We have generated test
implications from the model which can compared against geochronological and biological
data obtained from sediment cores taken in the Peten. (37)

Workman, William B., DATED TRACES OF EARLY HOLOCENE MAN IN SOUTHWEST
YUKON, CANADA. 1966 excavations at the Canyon Site (JfVg-1) yielded a smail :
collection of artifacts at a depth of 7 ft beneath modern ground surface. This assemblage, :
consisting of 2 thin round-based projectile points (1 burinated), a thick biface fragment, and ;
2 fragments of Bison sp., is dated at 5245 B.C.+100 (SI-1117). This paper compares the
Canyon finds with other material from southwest Yukon whose roughly comparable age can
be surmised on other than typological grounds, places the material in geological and
paleo-environmental context, and compares it with material of comparable age in adjacent
areas to evaluate its broader significance. (7)
Wright, H. T., and M. A. Zeder, THE SIMULATION OF LINEAR RECIPROCAL TRADE
SYSTEM UNDER EQUILIBRIUM CONDITIONS. The purpose of this simulation was to
demonstrate that message-free reciprocal exchange of goods between egalitarian com-
munities will not operate unless at least 2 types of goods move through the system, These
two types are the so-called ‘‘useful’’ commodities which are used in a fixed ratio to
population, and the so-called “‘status’’ or “socio-technic" of ‘symbolic’ goods which need
not be used in fixed ration to population. If the flow of the latter type is produced asa set
function of the producer's population and is exchanged from community to community at a
constant proportion of goods received, then all producers are receiving information about
the condition of this producer's community. This information can be used in a very simple
fashion to regulate the production of demographically linked goods destined for the other |
producer. The simulation uses populations, goods, and rates derived from western New
Guinea linear exchange systems as an example. The types of cycling in goods production at '
the producing communities and in intermediate communities elucidates the ‘‘trade cycles"
. of the midwestern Late Archaic period discussed by Howard Winters in New Perspectives in
| Archaeology. (24)

research was done on the Nazarategu! River, which runs parallel to the Neguachi River, by
William L. Allen who developed a sequence starting with the Cobichaniqui complex (1600
B.C.) and ending with the historical Pichis complex. The Nazarategui tradition comprises the
following complexes: Cobichaniqui, Pangotsi and Nazarategui. | am working toward (a) a
better definition of this tradition, (b) a comparison with Allen's material, and (c) finding
out if possible some relationships with other South American ceramic complexes. (30)
Yesner, David R., ALEUTIAN SUBSISTENCE-SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS: THE SOUTH-
WEST UMNAK FOCUS, With respect to the Aleutian ecosystem as defined by W. S.
Laughlin, in which both environmental and cultural uniformity through time and space has
generally been the rule, little attempt has previously been made to establish functional
differences in prehistoric settlement patterns as related to (1) different microenvironments
within the larger ecosystemic framework, and (2) seasonal configurations of faunal
availability. Through faunal and technological analysis, a comprehensive picture of the
regional integration of subsistence and settlement patterns has been achieved, indicating that
small, temporary “‘camp” sites are normally utilized for highly specialized subsistence
purposes, and remain integrated with larger, year-round central base villages, but that in
times of population expansion at the central base, these “camp” sites shift in orientation to
year-round settlements for wider subsistence purposes. Furthermore, through discriminant
analyses on stone tools associated with faunal clusters, it is possible to determine functional
tool-kits which enable prediction of the specialized activities at ‘tcamp” sites for which there
is no bone preservation. (23)

correlation is valuable to archaeological research as marked variation in the faunal inventory

cultural patterns. Also dates of occurrence of a particular animal from a few sites with
radiocarbon dating and stratigraphic contro! could be used as chronological and cultural

, ABSTRACTS OF ORGANIZED SYMPOSIA
Note that not all symposia have symposia abstracts nor do any general sessions
(1) ECOLOGICAL ANTHROPOLOGY. There are 2 main objectives for this symposium.
The first is to determine how elements of the behavioral repertoire of a particular
population interact systemically with non-cultural as well as other cultural elements within
the ecosystem. Ideational and other “‘social’’ or ‘‘cultural’’ elements can be variables in
functional relationships with others; as has been demonstrated in terms of ritual and
sanctity, cultural elements may serve as mechanisms regulating the relationships among the
variables within the system. The second objective is to determine how ecosystems maintain
stability and change through time. Because variables in ecosystems often fluctuate,
regulatory mechanisms must be capable of maintaining and reestablishing appropriate
relationships if the system is to persist. When the operation of these mechanisms fails,
evolution may be said to occur. This symposium will explore the processes of stability and
change and the role cultural factors play in them.
(2) LITHIC TECHNOLOGY SYMPOSIUM: DEBITAGE ANALYSIS. This symposium
session will present a selection of papers devoted to the topic of lithic debitage analysis.
Emphasis on lithic technology in the past decade has focused chiefly on analyzing finished
tools, recognizing reduction techniques, and experimental studies aimed at replicating
prehistoric tools and wear patterns. Recent studies of debitage has brought to light the data
potential of this common artifact class. It is the aim of this symposium to present case
studies illustrating some of the kinds of information that can be gained through debitage
analysis.
(3) DATA BANKS AND RELATED USES OF COMPUTERS IN ARCHAEOLOGY, During
the last several years at SAA meetings, there has been an increasing number of papers on
the uses of computers in archaeology, but usually scattered almost randomly through-
out the meetings in various sessions. Some have been on archaeological data banks,
while others were on other uses of computers in archaeological research. Now, it is time to
have a session devoted solely to computers in archaeology. This suggested symposium is
emphasizing the role of archaeological data banks since they are seemingly attracting
considerable attention among archaeologists today and are relevant to anyone dealing with
archaeological data for almost any purpose. The general purpose of this symposium is to
present some of the different ways in which data banks are being used by archaeologists
around the country and to suggest other possibilities and future goals.
(4) HOLOCENE CLIMATIC CHANGE IN THE GREAT BASIN: PRESENTATION OF
REGIONAL SEQUENCES. Several recent archaeological studies in the Great Basin have
employed paleo-climatic reconstructions, which, although based on different kinds of data
gathered from different parts of the Basin, are quite similar. The time seems ripe for an
attempt at a Basin-wide, paleo-climatic correlation and a reevaluation of the climatic models
proposed by Antevs and others, Toward that end, each participant of this symposium will
present a paper containing substantive paleo-climatic data from a Great Basin locality or
localities. Each paper will also contain a summary in the form of a regional climatic
sequence. Basin-wide correlations of these regional sequences will be attempted during the
following*symposium.
(6) ARCHEOLOGY IN THE 70'S—MITIGATING THE IMPACT. Responsible and efficient
planning for the nation’s archaeological programs depends on a realistic assessment of needs
which can be identified through thoughtful regional overviews. An obvious first step will be
the preparation of regional syntheses of work already accomplished. The crisis in American
archaeology raises questions of urgent relevance: What is left to do? How much time
remains? Who will undertake the studies? How can we pay for them? And how do these
questions relate to anthropology in general? Representatives from the various regions will
explore these questions and discuss mechanisms and approaches by which solutions can be
found and implemented.
(9) THE GREAT AMERICAN DREAM MACHINE: ARCHAEOLOGISTS IN THE WORKS.
For the past decade the discipline of archaeology has been in a state of flux and ferment
over issues of epistemological goals and relevance, accountability, and public awareness. We
propose that archaeologists as archaeologists can apply their method and theory to the
study of material culture in modern human behavior. Archaeology can build on its core of
method and theory to study material culture and its behavioral correlates in any cultural
setting,
(10) ISLAND ADAPTATION: CURRENT RESEARCH IN HAWAIIAN ARCHAEOLOGY.
During the past several years Hawaiian archaeological research has concentrated on patterns
of adaptation to island environments. The extensive remnants of agricultural systerns, in
particular, have begun toa be exploited by archaeologists. This symposium brings together
the results of this recent research by emphasizing development and change in agricultural
and residence systems, resource intensification, and social boundaries and complexity. The
16
, theme of island adaptation provides the basis for arguments of relevance to larger
anthropological problems, such as expansion into uninhabited environments, population
growth and resource use, and the elaboration of social stratification.
(11) ARCHAEOLOGY AND EDUCATION, The topics under consideration are of specific
relevance to archaeologists in public positions such as those working in museums and on
salvage and survey work, Proper education in archaeology has too often been restricted to
academic circles, leaving the public and special interest groups to fend on their own, The
critical state of American archaeology today and its fate will depend, to a great extent, on
an educated public, informed legislators and industrial managers, and on cooperation with
Native Americans. The symposium is designed to cover several aspects of public education
and their attendant problems.
(12) HOLOCENE CLIMATIC CHANGE IN THE GREAT BASIN: CORRELATION OF
REGIONAL SEQUENCES AND REEVALUATION OF PREVIOUS CLIMATIC MODELS.
An interdisciplinary panel of discussants will provide syntheses and trial correlations of the
regional climatic sequences presented in the previous symposium, as well as comments on
the implications of the data in terms of their particular specialities: vegetation, geomorphic
processes, long-term weather systems, and, of course, people and culture. Further comments
and data from the floor will be called for, after which the panel, the participants of the
previous symposium, and those in general attendance will engage in free discussion, The
proceedings will be taped.
(14) FEDERAL ARCHAEOLOGY: THE PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS OF THE DEPRES-
SION YEARS. It is over 40 yr since shovels were handed to participants in the first publicly
funded projects in archaeology organized as a response to the unemployment of the
Depression years. Among these were the PWA, CCC, NYA, WPA, and TVA projects; the
latter generating what was probably the first publicly funded salvage archaeology. The
symposium will cover the history of the public works projects; how archaeology came to be
incorporated; how projects were selected, organized, funded, published. Discussion will
include a consideration of the goals of this research and whether participants believe these
were reached. The effect of ‘‘New Deal” archaeology on subsequent American research (i.e.,
methods of excavation, research design, processing, analysis, etc.) will be discussed.
(15) PALEO-INDIANS IN THE GREATER SOUTHWEST. Information has been steadily
accumulating on the Paleo-anthropology of western deserts but no program has yet been
organized to exchange and synthesize data. The time is now ripe for a symposium of experts
to discuss and codify problems, procedures and theories pertaining to the archaeology of
desert surfaces. Such a symposium will contribute significantly to knowledge of early
hunter-gatherers in the New World.
(19) HISTORIC INDIANS OF FLORIDA AND SOUTHEASTERN GEORGIA: ETHNO-
HISTORICAL-ARCHAEOLOGICAL CORRELATIONS. Changes in aboriginal southeastern
populating 200 yr of European contact afford the anthropologist a comparative field
situation for the study of rapid culture change occurring through contact between western
cultures and non-western (derived), non-white cultures. Because such contact situations are
widespread and have received a great deal of theoretical attention, the anthropologist is able
to predict form and results of specific Southeast European-!ndian contact situations and to
test hypotheses with archaeological methods. Likewise, where the form and resuits of
culture change are known from documentary evidence, archeological methods can be tested.
Thus, the symposium will have 2 goals: (1) to provide theoretical information of rapid
culture change; and (2) to demonstrate which archaeological artifacts and features represent
which known ethnographic forms and events.
(20) FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF STONE TOOLS. The aims of the symposium will be
similar to those of the symposium held at the SAA meeting in Miami. Discussion will center
on (1) the mechanics of flaking stone by percussion and pressure, and the application of
these principles to the study of edge damage on stone tools; (2) experiments in the
production of edge damage on stone flakes by various activities; (3) the current aims and
status of functional analysis of stone tools.
(21) PREHISTORIC RAW MATERIAL TRADE AND ARCHAEO-ECONOMIC PRO-
CESSES. Recently, archaeologists have devoted a great deal of attention to the problem of
determining prehistoric trade relationships by establishing the origin of raw materials and
artifacts within archaeological sites. The value of this archaeological research is that it
provides an opportunity to study the broad economic processes in a chronological
perspective. Unlike ethnographic studies on economic process, the archaeologist is provided
with a record which reflects the repeated phenomena of socio-economic interaction, although
these actual processes remain to be determined. Although no general archaeo-economic
theory has been elucidated up until now, it is hoped that this symposium will serve as a
stage in its development.
(22) NARRATIVE SCENES IN MESOAMERICAN ART: A SOCIO-CULTURAL PER-
SPECTIVE. Participants in the symposium will discuss the problems and the potential of the
use of a socio-cultural framework to analyze figure and scene portrayal in Mesoamerican art.
Some of the figures and scenes portrayed seem to represent historical events. For these
