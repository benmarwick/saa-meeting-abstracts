models of culture change.
(19) RELATIONS OF INEQUALITY: THE VIEW FROM THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES.
Northeast archaeology can contribute to social theories concerned with the origins, maintenance
and transformations of systems of social inequality. However, standard approaches treat
prehistoric populations as relatively egalitarian, ignoring variation and asymmetry in these social
relations. Similarly, investigations of historic populations rarely illuminate the processes of
Stratified societies. The papers draw on a variety of theoretical perspectives to examine the
spatial and material manifestations of social inequality in nonstratified and stratified societies.
They use these approaches to guide their investigation of problems specific to the Northeast, as
well as to stimulate the development of theory having applications beyond the Northeast.
(20) THE CORPS CARES: ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE 1980s. Nationwide, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers is involved in the location, evaluation, protection, mitigation and preservation of
cultural resources from early project planning stages through final construction. This symposium
presents a variety of viewpoints: from management, from contractors and from staff archaeol-
ogists. Included in the symposium is a discussion of regional planning, a large-scale survey and
test program, cultural resources management at a military installation, and stabilization of an
' historic grist mill and powerhouse.
(23) PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE FAP-405 HIGHWAY SALVAGE PROJECT AT THE RENCH
: SITE, PEORIA COUNTRY, ILLINOIS. Preliminary results of the multidisciplinary FAP-405 highway
Salvage project at the Rench site, Peoria County, Illinois, are presented. The Rench site is a
Stratified Late Archaic, Late Woodland and Mississippian habitation site located at the base of
the Central Illinois Valley Bluff along Dickison Run Creek. The Illinois State Museum has con-
ducted research into the prehistory, paleoecology and geology of the Rench locality. This sym-
posium primarily discusses the wealth of Weaver focus data recovered at Rench, including the
first complete Weaver house structures. Smaller quantities of Late Archaic, Havana, terminal
j Late Woodland and Mississippian remains also are examined.
(26) GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN THREE RIVER VALLEYS OF THE SOUTHEAST. This
symposium is designed to inform archaeologists throughout the Americas of recent develop-
ments in geoarchaeology in three major river valleys of the Southeast. The valleys are the Upper
' Tombigbee (northeast Mississippi), the Duck (middie Tennessee) and the Savannah (northeast
Georgia). Emphasis is placed on the full partnership between the geosciences and archaeology.
Research in the three valleys represents new applications of interdisciplinary research in the
heavily vegetated Southeast. Geoarchaeologists, geomorphologists, and soil morphologists pre-
; sent results from each area. The themes of the papers are integrated at the close of the session.
; (27) TOWARD AN ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SYMBOLIC ORDER. The theoretics of the New Ar-
chaeology have offered an entirely new structure of inquiry and have transformed the discipline
; of archaeology. Yet, they also have tended to homogenize the past by conceptualizing of other
: societies as highly differentiated and coherent systems. If a sense of the premodern social whole
emerges, it usually is thought an economizing, capitalist order. These papers help to expand the
interpretive limits of processual archaeology through explorations of past symbolic structures. A
variety of data are examined in order to discover how premodern social wholes were constructed,
symbolized, and made into artifacts.

(28) ARCHAEOLOGICAL LEGISLATION: MANAGING OUR ARCHAEOLOGICAL HERITAGE. This
symposium is concerned with the various types of legislation enacted by both the federal govern-
ment and various state governments to conserve archaeological remains. The papers presented
in this symposium focus on three specific areas: 1) an overview of the federal legislation promul-
gated to conserve archaeological resources; 2) the effectiveness of the interrelationship between
federal legislation and particular states statutes within a regional setting: and 3) an analysis of
land use controls and planning techniques developed by local communities to conserve archaeo-
logical remains. The papers presented in this symposium individually and collectively increase
understanding of current archaeological legislation:
(29) PROBLEMS IN NORTHERN RIO GRANDE PREHISTORY. The northern Rio Grande remains
one of the least known areas of Southwestern research. In the absence of direct data, models
drawn from other work, primarily the Middle Rio Grande, have been used to explain puebloan
prehistory to the north. Recent excavation and survey (1978-82) in the Taos District
demonstrates the inadequacy of these models by establishing the presence of a distinctly north-
ern pattern. Work has focused on problems of settlement distribution and organization, sub-

sistence and land use, and trends in material culture, especially lithic sourcing and ceramic
analysis. Research reveals unexpectedly complex cultural developments distinctive trom, but
related to, other regions in the northern Southwest. |
(30) RECENT INVESTIGATIONS AT TLAJINGA 33:S3W1, TEOTIHUACAN. Extensive excavation of
an apartment compound was recently conducted in the Tlajinga Barrio on the southern margin of
the ancient city of Teotinuacan. This excavation represents the first systematic, extensive ex-
cavation of a Teotihuacan apartment compound utilizing modern data recovery techniques. The
excavation provided, for the first time, specific classes of data related to social composition,
demography, mortality, health, subsistence and economic specialization. The techniques used to
obtain these data include fine screening, soil analysis, flotation and pollen analysis. The results
provide a comprehensive picture of one sector of Teotihuacan urban life.
(31) THE STATUS OF ARCHAEOBOTANICAL RESEARCH IN THE AMERICAS. Five speakers in .
this symposium summarize archaeoethnobotanical research in North and South America con-
ducted to the present. Suggestions are made by each speaker for shaping recovery and research ;
programs in the future. This is particularly needed in view of the growing lack of financial support
which demands that programs be particularly well planned and provide some promise for answer-
ing questions raised by past recoveries.
(32) THE PROSPECTS FOR A PHILOSOPHY OF ARCHAEOLOGY. Recent comments on estab-
lished modes of philosophical! discussion in and of archaeology have raised a number of ques-
tions about the value of such discussion and the direction that it should take to best contribute to
the discipline (cf., Flannery’s objections to internal commentary, Clarke's earlier promotion of
“internal philosophy” and Schiffer's recent discussion of relations between philosophy and ar-
chaeology). Contributors to the session address these encompassing issues through analysis of |
specific problem areas where philosophical concerns bear directly on (or emerge within) ar- }
chaeological practice. The relevance of various philosophical perspectives to archaeology will
thus be explored in light of the most recent work in this area.
(35) DUSTY ARCHIVES: THE RESEARCH POTENTIAL OF EXISTING ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE
AND SURVEY DATA. Tens of thousands of archaeological sites recorded in institutions across ,
the United States are an enormous and virtually untapped basis for primary research. While these
data frequently form a biased sample which can be quantitatively intractable, their study allows j
regional research at an unprecedented scale, which can encompass the entire territory of one or
more social Systems and offers sample sizes 10-100 times larger than those usually found. These
possibilities are presently largely wasted. This symposium presents examples of the scientific
potential of existing data, using a variety of analytic techniques, in the hope of stimulating
similar research.
(36) THE JOY AND TORMENT OF LARGE-SCALE CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY: THE CHIEF
JOSEPH DAM CULTURAL RESOURCES PROJECT, During the last decade, archaeologists have
been concerned with contributions of contract archaeology to the field. As a large-scale,
multidigciplinary project in contract archaeology, the Chief Joseph Dam Cultural Resources Proj-
ect has proved an admirable if, at times, a daunting assay of the constraints and possibilities af-
forded by contract archaeology. This symposium examines the project's contributions to Colum-
bia Plateau prehistory and the application of current archaeological method and theory to a vast
body of data. Directions of future research in several areas are suggested. The common theme of
the symposium is the marriage of research and contract archaeology.
(37) CULTURAL CHANGE AND CLIMATIC CHANGE IN THE CIRCUM-CARIBBEAN AND ATLAN-
TIC COAST. Recent developments in solar physics and volcanology allow refined definitions of
the effects of the sun and volcanos on climate. Since prehistoric data are also available on these
phenomena, global climate can be modeled in some detail for the Holocene. The effects of global
climate on the behavior of the Bermuda High dictates the climate of the circum-Caribbean and
the east coast of North America. Using a climatic sequence generated from this model. the ef-
fects of climate on culture change are discussed for Puerto Rico, Yucatan. Texas, Florida and
Virginia. |
(38) MISSISSIPPIAN/LATE WOODLAND FARMSTEADS AND FOOD PRODUCTION. Early rural
Mississippian farmsteads are a critical component for the basic understanding of the larger
framework of Mississippian culture development. These so-called “fourth line" rural settlements
are distinct from, but may be part of, the town pattern such as evidenced at Cahokia. Present in-
dications are that these farmsteads, in addition to participating in different interaction spheres,
may actually have substantially predated the development of the towns, and thus are in fact
basic to the development of classic Mississippian settlement patterns.

(51) Application of Phytolith Analyses 31
| (39) ARCHAEOLOGICAL USES OF PLANT OPAL PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS: CURRENT RESEARCH.
} This symposium brings together state-of-the-art research in the development and application of
¥ plant opal phytolith analysis in paleoethnobotany and paleoecology. Applications of this relative-
4 ly new technique in multidisciplinary archaeology are proving to be extraordinarily productive in
iu several problem areas and geographic regions. Results from a wide range of current research are
: presented on: 1) Old Worid and New World prehistory problems; 2) agricultural and nonagricul-
1 tural contexts varying from arid to tropical to temperate zones; 3) taxonomic identification of
cultigens and wild plant resources; 4) statistical procedures and data collection strategies; and 5)
cultural resource management Survey, planning and site evaluation.
(40) MUNSUNGUN LAKE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH PROJECT. The goal of the Munsungun
Lake Archaeological Research Project is to reconstruct the settlement, subsistence and lithic
’ procurement patterns of a poorly Known archaeological region in northern Maine. An environmen-
. tal archaeological approach is used to place the history of human adaptation in an environmental
i context. Initial findings by specialists from the disciplines of bedrock geology, Quaternary
geology, paleoecology, soil science, cultural anthropology and prehistoric archaeology made
during the period from 1980 to 1982 are presented.
(42) COMPUTER SIMULATION AND TESTING OF PREHISTORIC ECONOMIC DECISION MAKING
ON THE NORTHWEST COAST: HOKO RIVER ROCKSHELTER SITE. The research focus for the
. Hoko River Archaeological Project involves: 1) computer simulation of economic decision models
? for prehistoric hunters-gatherers-fishers to test theoretical models explaining Native American
cultural evolution on the Pacific Northwest Coast; and 2) archaeological testing and evaluation of
s these economic models with data recovered from the Hoko River site complex and from other ar-
. chaeological site excavations in the region. This symposium concentrates on the recently ex-
r plored Hoko Rockshelter site and on the data involved in responding to established research
- problems.
4 (44) NEW WORLD MARITIME ADAPTATIONS. This symposium addresses the current status of
> research about maritime adaptations—broadly defined as ‘‘prehistoric peoples’ interactions with
me the ocean’’—in the Western Hemisphere. Overview papers treat specific coastal areas
= throughout the Americas and synthesize and interpret maritime adaptations on a region-by-
. region basis. Where warranted by the archaeological record, regional specialists also discuss in-
= traregional variations as these pertain to maritime adaptation. Discussants compare and con-
= trast adaptations for regional and larger geographic areas.
3 (45) RIPPLES IN THE CHICHIMEC SEA: NEW CONSIDERATIONS OF SOUTHWESTERN U.S. AND
- MESOAMERICAN INTERACTION. The last ten years have seen a flurry of thought and research
‘ on the nature of interaction between Mexico and the southwestern U.S. Recently, investigators
. have been moving beyond the “isolationism vs. Aztec pochteca” model to more sophisticated in-
= teraction models. Prominent among these are ones derived from the world-system approach of
4 Wallerstein. This symposium presents new data on Mesoamerican-Southwestern interaction and
. considers the latest theoretical advances. The issues raised go beyond the culture history of two
; major regions; the basic question is, "At what scale does one study culture change?”
»
5 (48) EVOLUTIONARY THEORY AND ARCHAEOLOGY; ISSUES AND APPLICATIONS. Traditional!
2 views of cultural evolution are being increasingly questioned, especially by archaeologists. Alter-
M natively, perspectives from evolutionary biology, specifically evolutionary ecology, are being in-
+ vestigated, Whether anthropology will simply borrow from or actively participate in the develop-
Bo ment of evolutionary theory depends upon continued debate. Significant theoretical issues in the
‘ archaeological investigation of human behavioral evolution include: 1) the relationship between
selection and the various concepts of adaptation; 2) the measurement of fitness and the role of
" optimization modeling; and 3) the identification of appropriate units of selection in increasingly
: complex human societies. These and other issues are addressed theoretically and empirically.
= (50) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE LOCATION PREDICTION MODELS; DERIVATIONS AND APPLICA-
2 TIONS. The symposium considers various methods of derivation and factors affecting accuracy
, and validity of predictive models for archaeological site location. These include strengths and
weaknesses of various Statistical methods (discriminant function, logistic regression, ordinary
multiple regression, cluster analysis, etc.), use of existing or specially collected data, variable
selection, sampling methods, testing, practical field decisions, site ranking and computer-aided
site prediction mapping. In-depth comparative studies highlight problems posed by differing en-
. vironments and cultures, and theoretical implications for prehistoric subsistence explanation are
explored, Finally a cautionary note for some land use applications is sounded.
: (51) PROBLEMS OF THE APPLICATION OF PHYTOLITH ANALYSES TO ARCHAEOLOGY. This
A symposium takes the form of a panel discussion (with audience participation) of the major prob-
, 32 (52) "he Copan Project
lems in state-of-the-art application of phytolith analyses to the solution of archaeological prob-
lems. Discussed will be the morphological classification of phytoliths, adequate description of
phytolith morphology, morphological variation, statistical analysis techniques for phytolith
assemblages in archaeological sediments, geographic variation in assemblages, extraction tech-
niques, data banks, counting statistics and related pressing problems in phytolith research.
Panelists include many of the leading researchers in the field,
(52) THE COPAN PROJECT: PHASE TWO, RESULTS OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS. In 1981, the j
government of Honduras initiated a four-year program of research at Copan, Honduras. Two years
of this project have been completed and the symposium presents the results of the project to
date. The major activity of this project is large-scale excavations at what is currently called the
Sepulturas Barrio. The barrio consists of approximately 80 residential groups including some 400 .
Mounds covering an area of 30 hectares. Four complete plaza groups have been excavated as
have large portions of four others, including some 40 residential structures. Preliminary ideas of [
Maya social class organization and the composition and size of the Maya household are
presented.
(54) PALEOINDIAN IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA: NEW LOOKS AT AN OLD PROBLEM. This
symposium treats fundamental concerns of Paleoindian archaeology in the eastern United
States. The three main areas treated: 1) late Pleistocene/early Holocene environments as they
may relate to human ecological systems, 2) new findings in chipped stone manufacturing and the
organization of technologies; and 3) the reconstruction of subsistence systems in terms of both :
environments and technology. The symposium provides a forum for bringing together new ideas
and substantive interpretation.
(55) ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE PUBLIC. Because the discipline of archaeology has traditionally
suffered from a case of myopia, its future health is uncertain. This symposium addresses the ;
problem of how to build the broader public support base that will be instrumental in facilitating
active research in upcoming decades. Papers by archaeologists discuss what should be '
presented to the public and how it can be presented to maximum advantage, Innovative methods
of engaging public interest are evaluated, Representatives from the television, newspaper, '
magazine and popular book industries discuss archaeology's public image.
(56) CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENT IN THE SOUTHEASTERN PIEDMONT. The purpose of this ‘
symposium is to present the results of multidisciplinary investigations undertaken along the
Piedmont segment of the Savannah River as part of the Cultural Resources Mitigation Program |
on the Richard B. Russel! Dam and Lake Project, one of the major data recovery projects in the
Southeast. Occupations span the range from late glacial to recent times, and 4 team of paleoen-
vironmental specialists and archaeologists nave been addressing problems of both site-specific
and regional concern in an attempt to develop a comprehensive picture of changing man-land
relationships through time. The papers also attempt to place site-specific findings in a broader
regional context to provide perspective on the changing socioeconomic landscape.

(58) AMERICAN CONTRIBUTIONS TO PALEOLITHIC METHODOLOGY Mos! Americans doing
Paleolithic archaeology in Eurasia ask research questions that are very different from those
posed by their Eurasian counterparts. The implication is that suitable methods must be
developed to respond to these questions at every level of research. This symposium explores
such methodological issues and applications 4s they pertain to: 1) meaningful classification of
lithic artifacts; 2) questions of technological and organizational continuity im the Upper Paleolithic
succession; 3) assessments of faunal exploitation strategies: 4) regions! studies of settlement/land
use patterns; and 5) the understanding of interregional relationships Guring the Paleolithic.

I Abrams, E. M. (Penn State) ECONOMIC SPECIALIZATION IN LATE CLASSIC COPAN, HON.
5 DURAS. The degree of economic specialization in Late Classic Copan is measured through an
J analysis of sculpting. Three timed replication experiments are Conducted, thus quantifying this
i specialty. The application of these standard figures to major sculptural pieces indicates that very
: few sculptors were required at Copan. This very low number of specialists suggests a low degree
| of specialization, which fits well with analogies for complex chiefdoms as well as several known
' states. It Is concluded that this low level of specialization played at best a minor role in the
j development of social stratification. (52)
Adams, R. E. W. (Texas at San Antonio) and Eric C. Gibson (Harvard) HOLOCENE CLIMATE AND
CULTURE CHANGE IN THE MAYA LOWLANDS. A previous effort by Gunn and Adams demon-
} strated a logical relationship between Late Holocene (5000 BP to present) climatic change and
; culture chronology in Mesoamerica. This paper reexamines the original hypothesis in the light of
‘ the new, high-resolution climatic sequence generated from solar and volcanic data which
: became available after the first paper. The new climatic chronology explains previous problem
i episodes such as the hiatus between the Maya Preclassic and Classic. The origins of the Mayain

= Ahler, S. A. (North Dakota) USE-PHASE CLASSIFICATION AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOL-
j OGY IN PLAINS VILLAGE ARROW POINTS. A sample of ca. 2,500 artifacts from the Walth Bay
earthiodge village site (39WW203) in South Dakota provides the basis for developing a tech-
: nological model of the manufacturing trajectory of arrow points. Identification of stages in arrow
s point manufacture is aided by data from ca. 50 refitted fractured specimens. This leads to a use-

of corn is a human artifact that has been the object of human selection for at least eight millenia.
The morphology of the maize ear should reflect both the cultural and the environmental selection
pressures to which it has been subjected during its long evolutionary association with man.
Analysis of maize collections obtained from the Tarahumara Indians of southern Chihuahua sug-
gests that characters employed in racial investigations by previous investigators may not be ap-
propriate for describing racial evolution, but may actually describe environmental variation
and/or morphologically plastic attributes easily modified through human selection. Recognizing

cesses are also important research considerations. (13)
Browman, David L. (Washington, St. Louis) INCAIC HUANCA POLITY LITHIC INDICATORS. While
archaeological work on Inca occupations in Peru normally focus exclusively upon architecture
and settlement patterns, in the Jauja-Huancayo area of Junin the analysis of Inca period lithic
tool assemblages provided unexpected information in terms of lithic indicators. A shift in
camelid production techniques was identified; a previously unreported mitmag (inca resettie-
mentcolony) was verified; and lithics provided a mechanism for distinguishing the settlements of
one of the three subdivisions from the other Huanca federation groups. (11)
Brown, Barton McCaul (SUNY, Buffalo) POPULATION ESTIMATION FROM FLOOR AREA—A
RESTUDY OF “NAROLL'S CONSTANT.” From a worldwide, cross-cultural study of ethnographic
cultures (American Antiquity 1962), Narol| concludes that population can be inferred from floor
area in the ratio of one person for each 10 square m of area. A restudy was conducted using the same
methodology. Several methodological problems with the original study are addressed: to whit,
sampling, variable definition and alternative hypotheses. The 1-to-10 ratio overestimates the
restudy prediction line by a factor of about two. Hence, “Naroll’s constant” led archaeologists
astray in population estimation. The results of the restudy offer a more reliable guide for this
task. (9)
Brown, James A. (Northwestern) ON THE ORIGIN OF POTTERY. An economic model is offered to
account for the appearance of ceramic container technology in different cultural traditions. This
model is particularly applicable to high-latitude settings where the earliest pottery is crude,
fragile and seemingly an unlikely replacement for other well-established container types. Pottery
has one advantage over alternatives that is critical in situations in which rising consumption of
all containers places intolerable demands on the time spent in making containers. Because pot-
tery manufacture can be divided into assembling, drying and firing stages, it offers potential sav-
ings of time in manufacture not possible in basketry and other competing container
technologies. (12)

Breadfruit (Ma/) is the most important plant resource in ethnographic Truk Lagoon, in the central
Caroline Islands of Micronesia. Archaeological research since 1977 suggests that the ethno-
graphic pattern of breadfruit reliance has at least 600 years of time depth, but possibly no more.
Major reliance on breadfrult as a staple crop may have begun in connection with a significant
episode of contact with Kosrae, some 600 miles to the east, and may have significantly affected
the development of modern Trukese social organization. (2)

maritime capabilities are a presumed prerequisite for the initial settlement of rugged, complex in-
sular coasts in areas with few land-based resources. Maritime adaptation may be later to the
north in the Bering-Chukchee Sea region, but the evidence has been destroyed in most regions
due to the rise of the sea to modern levels and coastal erosion. (44)

times explained by a model for variation in resource diversity linked to changes in regional
population growth rates. Faunal data from sites in Cantabrian Spain are analyzed from ca. 45,000
BP (Mousterian) through the end of the Roman Iron Age. Although of variable quality, the Can-
tabrian archaeofaunas are adequate to monitor regionwide changes in subsistence and to allow
for an evaluation of the diet-breadth model for this particular area. Discrepancies between ex-
pected and observed patterns are also discussed. (58)

utilized in the later Paleoindian and Archaic periods. Recent analyses of material from Little Sait

wealth was invested in domestic architecture was dependent upon the perceived desirability of

THEORETICAL AND METHODOLOGICAL PROBLEMS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES. It is
clear now that complex societies developed in Micronesia before the arrival of the Europeans.
However, the study of this development in Micronesia is fraught with several serious problems.
Problems include: 1) defining what a complex society is and what organizational changes oc-

hypotheses; and 4) archaeologically measuring relevant causal variables. This overview offers
resolutions based on synthetic work with historical and social anthropological data, archaeolog-

FERENCES FROM PREHISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL COMPLEXES. The Ciudadela was probably
the political center of Teotihuacan. However, it differs interestingly from many ruler’s palaces.
This is probably partly because political office in Teotihuacan was highly sacralized, but it also
suggests that much high-level political activity was carried out elsewhere, The "Calle de los
Muertos Complex" may have been used for this purpose, although there are other possibilities.
Nonresidential architecture at Teotinuacan is often too one-sidedly thought of in terms of
temples and religious ritual. More attention should be paid to political and other functions. In-
ferences about meanings of structures can and should be derived from architecture as well as
iconography. (30)

Northeast have assumed that undifferentiated bands characterize regional sequences until the ad:

traditionally to account for observed changes in the archaeological record. The alternative of-
fered here is that changes in the production of nonsubsistence items (moving toward craft
specialization) create potential asymmetries within and between groups which are mediated or
amplified by social mechanisms. Such an approach allows more meaningful understanding of
the range of organizational options between !Kung-like egalitarian baseline and the obvious

presumably established and reinforced by frequent intercommunity contact. In exporing the par-
| ticular extent and nature of such contacts, the geometric painted design style of Urfirnis is em-
| ployed (after consideration of past criticism of similar studies) as an index of interaction among
potters. The close bonds which emerge between different sites through time are discussed in
terms of exchange patterns and information flow. Relevant results of compositional analyses of
the Neolithic clays are also summarized. (17)

Dirst, Victoria (Wisconsin, Oshkosh) SOME OBSERVATIONS REGARDING ARCHAEOLOGICAL

EDUCATION IN WISCONSIN. Archaeologists today recognize that they have a serious obligation
to the profession to promote public understanding of the field. Yet, even though many profes-

there exists a basic conflict between what the archaeologists want to teach and what the public
wants to know. Using examples from Wisconsin, this paper examines: 1) the questions that need
to be answered; 2) the most effective means of addressing them; 3) the potentially undesirable ef-
fects of public exposure; and 4) the ways that we can acceptably present the conservation ethic.

Fritz, John M. (New Mexico) VIJAYANAGARA, SOUTH INDIA: THE STRUCTURE AND SYM-
BOLISM OF RITUAL KINSHIP IN A PREINDUSTRIAL HINDU STATE (14TH THROUGH 16TH CEN-
TURIES). The imperial capital of Vijayanagara embodied structural relations and symbolic
categories according to which participants in the dramas of state understood and established
their roles. Thus, rulers attempted to control the diverse polities of an essentially segmentary
state. An international, interdisciplinary team has been investigating the material record of the Ci-
ty for the past three years. Recent work indicates that myth, landscape, sastric models, the city
plan, routes of movement, ritual, sculpture and differentiated royal functions were interrelated
and mutually defined. Such symbolic wholes argue for the sacral and incorporative roles of the
kings. (27) |
Fuller, Michael J. (Washington, St. Louis) ABILA: A CITY-STATE IN JORDAN. The Decapolis, a
group of city-states, existed along the eastern edge of the Roman Empire. Two seasons of
systematic survey and excavation in and around the site have been aimed at: 1) establishing the
sequence of occupation; 2) defining the range of social stratification; 3) examining the economic
system; and 4) determining the impact of cultural diffusionism/migrations from outside the
region. The city’s wealth and power stemmed from its ties with the regional trade system, its in-
dustrial capabilities and the local agricultural produce. (17)

coastal adaptations have been influenced by late Quaternary climatic and sea level changes.
People were present within the shore zone throughout much of the region by late Paleoindian
times. First conclusive evidence of maritime adaptations is from the late Archaic. By this time, a
pattern of semipermanent villages with special activity satellite sites had been established in
some areas. Special strategies and technological adaptations related to resource procurement,
environmental hazards and transportation were utilized. (44)

SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN. Recent fieldwork in southwestern Wisconsin has revealed a
series of in situ stratified ridged agricultural fields. These fields can be, and for the first time are,
positively linked to the Oneota culture and can be dated accurately. Unlike other ridged fields in
Wisconsin and Michigan, which apparently functioned primarily as microclimatic control
devices, these structures probably were used for water control. The research adds new dimen-

Garber, Emily H. (New Mexico) HERDING, MOBILITY AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD.
The concept of animal domestication, like the concept of pastoral nomadism, has been seen as a
difficult one to make operational within archaeological research. The problems, however, may be
more methodological than definitional. Most archaeological work in this regard has been
centered on the site and its assemblage. Recent ethnographic and archaeological work indicates
that more fruitful assessments of the complexities of subsistence organization among herders
may be achieved through analyses of the relationships among sites. Several ethnographic cases
are examined in an effort to evaluate the archaeological consequences of specific patterns of
land use. (49)

Garber, James F, (Southwest Texas State) AN ANALYSIS OF ARTIFACT CONTEXT CONFIGURA-

defined configurations of artifacts from several contexts ranging from domestic to ritual. During
the Late Preclassic period at Cerros, there was a change from a nucleated to a dispersed settle-
ment type. The definition of contextual configurations of artifacts demonstrates a shift in the
kinds of material culture utilized as Cerros evolved from a nucleated village to a hierarchically
organized ceremonial center. The definition of these assemblages may prove useful In comparing

Gardner, W. M. (Catholic) THE FLINT RUN PALEOINDIAN COMPLEX REVISITED. The Flint Run
complex consists of several functionally different sites which interrelate to form a settlement

has allowed for development of a Middle Atlantic model. In a quasi-deterministic fashion, the
principal variable controlling site distribution is seen as the location of certain types of lithic
material, but this must be viewed in conjunction with the site type and other resources. (54)

CLIMATE AND CULTURE CHANGE ON THE ATLANTIC COAST OF SOUTHEASTERN UNITED

the area to be climatically sensitive and culturally variable. Early Holocene depositional episodes
indicate a reasonable relationship to storms originating in the summer in the tropical Atlantic (as
| discussed by Wendland), xeric vegetation and flood plain deposition. Warmer intervals result in
Sparse upland vegetation, more frequent summer storms and, as a consequence of these, more
valley deposition. Culture changes can, therefore, be correlated to climatic conditions by rates of

Garza-Vaides, Leoncio A. (Texas, San Antonio) SPECIFIC IGONOGRAPHY OF OLMEC RULERS.
There are many indications that Olmec society was a stratified one. In the period 1050-1000 BC,
numerous examples of specific iconography are known, among which are: 1) La Venta (Altar IV,
decorated earspools of Tomb C); 2) San Lorenzo (Calzadas carved); 3) Tlapacoya (Pilli blanco); 4)
Tlatilco (Cafe negruzca); 5) Las Bocas; 6) Atlihuayan; 7) Laguna de Jos Cerros; 8) San Jose Mogote:
and 9) Chalcatzingo. The iconography consists of a Jaguar head and two crested snake heads
(seen on the La Venta earspools, at the top of Altar |1V and on the U-shaped Ruler Pectoral) or a
paw-wing motif. The synchronism in these sites suggests that a specific ruler from La Venta is in-
volved. In the iconography of these altars, the names of these king-priests are indicated. Balam
Kukulkan is the suggested translation for the ruler named on La Venta Altar IV. (41)

and transmitting social information. Limitations of lithics in these areas relative to other material
culture classes also are discussed. Lithic data from a Formative Peruvian assemblage are ex-

with Oneota or Woodland bases. Among the archaeological phases referred to are Silvernale,
Blue Earth, Cambria, Orr and Great Oasis. The paper concludes with an evaluation of several ac-
culturation processes that may have been occurring in Minnesota during this time period. (6)

metaphysical beliefs. Two metaphysical systems, realism and positivism, are examined, and the
question is raised whether realism is a better metaphysics for archaeology than positivism, The
argument is made that: 1) the metaphysical system one adopts does make a difference in the
practice of archaeology; 2) metaphysical systems (such as behaviorism or Marxism) are best
regarded as methodological tools called research programs, and 3) an awareness of these pro-
grams puts archaeologists in a position to assess research alternatives more critically. (32)

processes involved in site formation; 2) recent quantitative analyses of lithic artifact
technological variability; 3) indications of social organization (with an emphasis on part-time
flintknapping specialists); and 4) evidence of exchange systems, The sites of Abri Pataud, Cor-

characteristics generally considered to be indicative of later prehistoric periods are present at

fauna from Late Stone Age and “Stone Bow!" sites have revealed that domestic stock was
widespread in the region by the ist millenium BC. Preliminary findings hint at several regionally
distinct subsistence modes between 1000 BC and AD 1000. In the high grasslands of Kenya and

such sites reveal interesting correspondences with modern slaughtering practices. (17)

One of the most important aspects of archaeological pollen analysis is to achieve a better
understanding of the mechanisms by which pollen, and especially ethnobotanic pollen, is
culturally introduced into archaeological contexts. In this study the potential for retention of
ethnobotanic pollen on food items is evaluated through the pollen washes of a variety of
economically important plants. Factors involving garden activities are also considered through
the study of pollen samples from modern gardens containing varieties of crops and weeds
typically exploited by Southwestern culture groups. The results of this study are then compared
to pollen data from prehistoric gardens. (8)

FARMHOUSE. Recent excavation in southern Iraqi Kurdistan has provided the first example of a

tion within an architectural setting may consist of a series of overlapping zones. These zones do
not necessarily partition themselves according to discrete spatial contexts (€.g.. rooms, court-
yards), or to the distributions of artifact material classes or functional types. In this particular
case, pattern recognition is analogous to a kaleidoscope as the scale of analysis or the in-
vestigated variables are shifted. (17)

Goad, Sharon |. (Louisiana State) POVERTY POINT: A GROUND-LEVEL VIEW, Various interpreta-

site, have been proposed for the Poverty Point site. While excavations have bee: carried out
sporadically on the site for over 40 years, no map of the site exists and very little is known about
the relationship of the various ridge structures. This paper presents a comprehensive discussion
of the sequence of ridge construction, the use and formation of the aisleways and the effects of
150 years of plowing on the ridge and mound structures. The results of this study suggest that the
aboriginal construction of the site did not resemble the site as it is depicted today. (34)
Goldstein, Lynne (Wisconsin, Milwaukee) MIDDLE AND UPPER MISSISSIPPIAN: A QUESTION

northern fringe are termed Upper Mississippian. Unique in this pattern is Aztalan, considered to
be Middle Mississippian even though the general region is noted for Oneota (Upper Mississip-
pian) sites. This determination has been made on the basis of particular artifact styles and ar-
| chitectural features. Using models of social organization derived from mortuary sites in the
Lower Illinois Valley, Aztalan and some Oneota sites are examined to determine whether Aztalan
best fits a model of Middle Mississippian organization, regardless of its artifact attributes, (6)
Goodyear, A. C. (South Carolina) PIECES ESQUILLES OR BI-POLAR CORES? LOOKING AT
TOOLKIT ENTROPY AMONG PALEOINDIAN LITHIC ASSEMBLAGES. Like all mobile funter-
gatherers, Paleoindians would have taced the problem of raw material procurement and tool
replacement as a normal function of their settlement systems. Procuring raw material from other
tools and equipment, i.e., recycling, is a strategy common to hunter-gatherers depending on their
situation, Bipolarly flaked artifacts, which have been called piecés esquiliées among north-
eastern U.S. Paleoindian assemblages, are argued to be bipolar cores which represent a strategy
of raw material procurement by recycling. Strong statistical evidence is presented showing that
the number of bipolar cores on a site is inversely related to the amount of usable lithic raw
material still present. (54)

by focusing upon basic spatial principles. By employing mathematical map transformations,
both travel-time and energetic surfaces ate developed for portions of the Basin of Mexico. This
allows a proposal of the form that past set{lement units assumed. Basic questions of ecological
adaptation within spatial settlement units are then explored, and the place of information pro-

Graham, R. W. (illinois State Museum) PALEOQENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENTS, FAUNAL
RESOURCES AND CLOVIS ADAPTATIONS, The modeling of Clovis subsistence systems is
hampered by the fact that there are no modern analogues for the late Pleistocene environments
and biotas of North America. However, paleoenvironmental reconstructions demonstrate the ex-
istence of both latitudinal and longitudinal gradients in the environment during this time period.
The distribution of biotas along these gradients was the result of individual species responding to
their own tolerance limits, thus constituting ecoclines. These ecoclines established resource
continua rather than discrete resource units. Gradient analysis of faunas from Clovis sites in the
Southwest, Great Plains and Midwest reflect differences in utilization of the faunal resource con-
tinua. Toolkits from these Clovis sites, however, do not vary significantly. General similarities in
the toolkits may reflect exploitation of ecological equivalents rather than specialization for one
prey species (i-e., mammoth). (54)

This paper explores the notion of inference to the best explanation as a possible model for

criteria appropriate to such selection are discussed with reference to two examples. One of these
considers a feature at Cihuatan, El Salvador, initially believed to be a Postclassic metal smelter;
the other deals with Emil Haury’s analysis of a migration to Point of Pines, Arizona, from the
Kayenta region. Both examples stress the importance of identifying evidenced relevant to the

in themselves these provide low-order information, they can be used as data in estimates of pro-
| duction and distribution of goods in the Bronze Age world. The evidence for metal production, for
long-distance exchange and for subsistence can, seen in conjunction, be used to make sugges-
tions as to the scale of the socioeconomic units involved. (3)

BRIDGES SITE: A SMALL MISSISSIPPIAN VILLAGE IN INTERIOR SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. During
1982, intensive excavations were conducted at the Bridges site located near Crooked Creek, a
tributary of the Kaskaskia River, in Marion County, Illinois. The complete excavation of this site,
which Is approximately 50 miles (80 km) east of the American Bottom. revealed a Late Woodland
component and a small Mississippian village. Extensively rebuilt wall trenci? structures are
distributed in a circular pattern around a plaza, indicating an established, planned community.
Research is focused on changes in subsistence patterns, chert utilization, intrasite organization,
culture history and the chronology of late prehistoric occupation of interior southern Illinois. (33)
Harris, J. W. K. (Milwaukee) and J. D. Clark (Berkeley) RESULTS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
| RESEARCH IN THE MIDDLE AWASH, ETHIOPIA, In 1981, a multidisciplinary palaeoan-
thropological research group began the survey of sedimentary deposits in the Middle Awash
Valley of Ethiopia. This survey showed that the Middie Awash deposits represent one of the
longest successions of fossiliferous (including hominids) and artifact-bearing strata known in
Africa. This report discusses the age, context and characteristics of the archaeological occur-
rences. Based upon this survey and preliminary observations from superficial and excavated con-
texts, the Middle Awash study area provides one of the few opportunities for making a detailed
study of archaeological traces for hominid activities over the last million and a half years. (17)

Hasenstab, Robert J. (Massachusetts, Amherst) THE APPLICATION OF GEOGRAPHIC INFOR-
MATION SYSTEMS TO THE ANALYSIS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE DISTRIBUTIONS. One
limitation to the analysis of archaeological site distributions is the control of spatial variability in
the parameters conditioning prehistoric settlement and archaeological recovery. A method ap-
propriate for the processing of spatial data is the use of geographic information systems. Such
systems consist of environmental and cultura! information coded into gridded “computer maps,"
amenable to analysis by digital image processing techniques. This capability permits the integra-
tion of large numbers of sites, broad expanses of terrain and diverse collections of variablés into
sophisticated models of archaeological prediction. The technical basis, inherent problems and
potential applications of the method are reviewed. (35)

provide a basis for reconstructing major components in the social system while disease, stress

some success to understand household composition at the Classic Maya site of Tikal. Briefly, a
few cross-cultural regularities from ethnology are applied to the burial and architectural data
from Group 2G-1. The resultant model fits the situation reasonably well: hypothetical ages
assigned to the “actors” required by the model allow for the birth of offspring at reasonable times
in their parents’ life spans, do not require people to live to unbelievable old ages and fit the
available time-frame of the time-spans defined for Group 2G-1. (7)

paper provides an overview of the current evidence for regional maritime adaptations with a
special focus on procurement strategies (particularly evidence of subsistence activities), settie-
ment patterns (including coastal vs. inland site variation) and exchange practices. Where data
permit, a diachronic perspective, revealing continuity or change in coastal adaptations, is
employed. Lastly, some suggestions for future regional research on this topic are highlighted.

Hegedus, Katalin (Hudson, New Hampshire) INDICATIONS OF SOCIAL DIFFERENTIATION IN THE
NEOLITHIC OF THE CARPATHIAN BASIN. In the evolution of the Middle and Late Neolithic in the
Carpathian Basin, a weakening of tribal structure and the beginning of preurban development are
evidenced by the hierarchy of settlements. The process reached its climax during the late
Neolithic Tisza culture. Craft specialization, agricultural intensification, the appearance of
metallurgy and intensified trade are the basic milestones of this economic-social development.
These changes made possible the accumulation of valuables by some individuals, as shown by
depot finds and by burial goods. Rank insignia and their cheap clay replicas further suggest
social differences, i.e., the coexistence of an emerging aristocracy and its subjects. (3)

Throughout 1983, archaeological events such as publications, museum exhibits, lecture series
and field trips are scheduled by a variety of museums, local societies and other institutions in the
State. Coverage of these events by the media is to be arranged by a salaried events coordinator.
The purpose of the program is to increase public awareness of archaeological values. The

Public participation programs in archaeology have met with varying success. A hindrance to the
improvement of such programs is the lack of communication among those who have ex-

been actively experimenting with various types of public participation. At its current state of
evolution, the public program is a self-supporting, year-round operation that conducts research
while educating large numbers of students of widely varying ages. This paper outlines the

Neolithic of western Europe have failed to consider the symbolism of the monuments

tifacts. This paper attacks methodological problems of evaluating the horizontal and vertical
depositional and postdepositional disturbances of the artifacts at one such site in order to pro-
vide a baseline for interpreting artifact patterning from a behavioral perspective. Refitting chipped
stone pieces provides one line of evidence used to argue that artifacts at the Cave Spring site were
not redeposited by the river, but that they had undergone postdepositional vertical displacement.

Past attempts to explain the mode and organization of the subsistence system of the Poverty

from evidence of apparent high population density and social complexity, since ar-
chaeobiological materials from this time period have generally not been preserved. Recent ex-
cavations at the J. W. Copes site (16MA47) in northeastern Louisiana have produced both well-
preserved faunal and archaeobotanical remains. These data provide a basis for examining the
nature of Poverty Point subsistence strategies and also the participation of one community in the

between 4000 and 3000 BC. Major changes in site utilization are indicated after 3000 BC. A variety
of physical and chemical analyses of soil were conducted to provide data on the origin and
development of the midden deposits. Interpretations of these and other related considerations

Some variations in the proportions and composition of the plant remains have implications for

Woodland reveals a close similarity, yielding no evidence that the shifts in cultural configuration
which are evident between these two periods were accompanied by any marked changes in sub-
sistence. (6)

Jones, Kevin T. (Utah) EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY AND THE FORAGER-COLLECTOR CON-
TINUUM. Using the Aché of eastern Paraguay as an example, the forager-collector continuum is
examined in the context of evolutionary ecology. It is posited that a foraging strategy is optimal
where resources are relatively randomly distributed spatially and seasonal variability is low. A
collecting strategy should be favored where resources are distributed in patches and when
seasonal variability in resource availability is great, especially if there are periods of time when
any resource acquisition is severely limited. Foraging systems therefore should be readily ad-
dressed using diet-breadth models, whereas collecting systems should only be predictable in
terms of patch choice models. Most systems are expected to employ a mix of these strategies.

MATERIAL WITHIN AN AEOLIAN SEQUENCE. CINNAMON CREEK RIDGE, NORTH DAKOTA.
Cinnamon Creek Ridge is on the Unglaciated Missouri Plateau 11 km west of the Little Missouri
River. Nearly continuous aeolian deposition has ocourred since late Wisconsinan time which is
draped over an erosional topography on the Paleocene Sentinel Butte Formation. Cultural
features of these deposits range in age from Late Prehistoric (1250 BP) to Early Archaic (5500 BP).
Approximately 3 m of fine sand to silt-sized sediment occurs on the surface of the ridge. Artifact
concentrations on the surface are found only at the edge of the ridge or along roadways where
erosion has occurred. Below the surface, cultural material is typically concentrated in two, and
up to four, paleosols. (21)

organizational variation within and between projects. One measure of organizational variability is
the degree of the site hierarchy as manifested by the sites within a settlement system. Given the
character of the archaeological data, site area or the number of rooms can be used to reconstruct
site hierarchies. One useful technique is the rank-size rule which can be used to assess the
overall structure of the system both synchronically and diachronically. After site stratification,
the organizational and spatial character of individual project data sets are investigated and com-
pared. (16)

MENDED STONE ARTIFACTS FROM RODGERS SHELTER AND PHILLIPS SPRING. An intensive
program of matching bifacial artifact fragments has resulted in invaluable new information about
the processes of chipped stone tool manufacture, use and discard behaviors. In and of
themselves, these data would justify the considerable effort spent in systematically comparing
the tragmentary artifacts. But, in addition, 4 major benefit has come in the identification of
stratigraphic contacts and a more comprehensive understanding of taphonomic processes
operating against the archaeological records of Rodgers Shelter and Philips Spring, two deeply
buried Archaic sites in the western Ozark Highland of Misouri. (15)
Kehoe. Alice 8. (Marquette) CHECK-STAMPED CERAMICS AND CHECKERED INTERPRETA-

considered a trait of the Mandan-Hidatsa-Crow ethnic groupings. Southern Prairie Province
check-stamped sherds have been interpreted as representing migration (Byrne) or seasonal |
bison-hunting forays (Syms) from the Middle Missouri. Late strata in the Felt site (EcNm-8), south-
central Saskatchewan, include a relatively large sample of check-stamped sherds but seem
unlikely to represent migration, hunting or trade from the Middle Missouri. Occupation by
Algonkian-speaking Atsina is hypothesized. (21)

Kelly, John E. (Ulinois, Urbana-Champaign) CAHOKIA AND ITS ROLE AS A GATEWAY CENTER IN
INTERREGIONAL EXCHANGE. The Cahokia site situated on the Mississippi flood plain near St.
Louis, Missouri, represents the largest and most complex Mississippian center. Previous studies
have described Cahokia as an urban center or central place. Another major aspect of Cahokia is
the establishment of Early Mississippian settlements to the north. A recent article on external
trade during the Formative period of Mesoamerica has provided another way in which to view
Cahokia’s links with its frontier to the north. Basically, this approach utilizes the concept of
gateway communities which are similar to dendritic market networks. This paper examines
Cahokia's role as a gateway center and the socioeconomic basis for its development. (6)
Kelly, Marcia K. (Washington State) MORPHOLOGICAL VARIATION OF MICROBLADES FROM
THE NARVESTAD SITE, SOUTHWEST WASHINGTON, Microblades are often used as evidence
for technological change and population movement in the Pacific Northwest. However, in order to
substantiate such interpretations, microblade variability must be understood. Replication of
microcores and bifaces from the Narvestad site demonstrates that pressure and percussion-
produced microblades are difficult to distinguish from fortuitously produced microblades. For-
tuitous microblades are selected from replicated biface debitage to compare with replicated
microblades. Discriminant analysis is employed to determine measurements, discriminating
among pressure, percussion and biface microblade classes. The results show that pressure
microblades are the most distinct whereas percussion and biface microblades exhibit similar
morphology. (43)

Kelso, G. K, (Boston) EXPERIMENTS IN THE RELIABILITY OF COPROLITE POLLEN SPECTRA.
Palynological studies of coprolites have been used on the assumption that differences in the
amounts of pollen recovered from archaeological feces reflect differences in the quality of pollen
ingested during separate 24- to 36-hour intervals. Experimental data indicate that pollen transit
time in the human gastrointestinal tract differs from that of associated food remains. In
coprolites this results in a predictable pattern of absolute pollen frequencies which accurately
reflect the quality of pollen ingested in approximately one of three focal pollen samples. The ab-
solute pollen frequencies of the remaining samples reflect only residence time in the
gastrointestinal tract. (8)

SOUTHWESTERN POPULATIONS—A MULTIVARIATE APPROACH. A growing dependency on a
primarily vegetarian (and especially maize) diet is generally accepted as the prime mover for the
high incidence of iron deficient anemia found among some prehistoric Southwestern
agriculturists. A multivariate approach to the factors causing iron deficient anemia is examined
and the conclusion that maize is but one of many variables involved in the rise of iron deficient
anemia through time among the Anasazi is suggested. Other factors, such as sedentism, village
life and diseases, are seen as important, if not more important than their diet, for causing the
anemia seen in prehistoric Southwestern populations and elsewhere. (22)

The bulk of the archaeobotanical materials at the Rench site were recovered from Weaver focus
features. Carbonized plant material represents over 40 taxa and suggests site usage at least dur-
ing the summer-fall period, Cultivated plants represented at the site include maize, pepo squash
and sumpweed. Possible cultigens include chenopod, cf, maygrass and Polygonum erectum. \|m-
portant wild food plants were blackberry, hawthorn, black cherry, hickory nul, hazelnul and grape.
Numerous seeds of a wild grass (ct., G/yceria) suggest that it was also used for food and may
have served as a substitute for seeds and other species (maygrass, sumpweed) that might have
been less common or less easily cultivated here than in the lower Illinois and Mississippi valleys

to the analysis of point patterns. However, archaeologists are concerned with distributions of ob-
jects that cannot be considered points. Following Ammerman, techniques of mosaic analysis
drawn from the ecological literature are applied to the problem of estimating the number and the
spatial distribution of houses on large Hohokam sites, Various techniques are tested by
simulating the placement of sample pits and trenches on completely excavated areas of the site
of Snaketown, and the results are then extended to develop estimates for the areas that have not
been exhaustively stripped. (14)

Kintz, E. R. (SUNY, Geneseo) NEIGHBORHOOD (CHINA) AND WARD (CUCHTEEL) IN A CLASSIC

Maya towns as centered around the temples, with nobles residing nearby and the lower class on
the town’s periphery, has been central to discussion of Classic Maya social, political and
economic organization. Doubtless, the settlement pattern of complex Maya centers during the
Classic period is represented by a general model of concentric zones. However, data from Coba
suggest organization in contiguous neighborhoods and wards. Differentiation of intrazonal
clusters of households, neighborhoods and wards reflects more precisely the sociopolitical and
economic organization of Coba and perhaps indicates patterns discernible in other Classic Maya
lowland cities. (7)

| developed for the Rio Grande National Forest, Colorado. The model derives environmental

criteria by which regions of the Forest may be determined to have high, medium or low potential
for aboriginal sites. Univariate statistics are employed to derive these areas. Fourteen en-
vironmental variables are examined and, from these, three diagnostic variables emerge. These
variables (low slope, low vertical distance from nearest permanent water and non-wooded vegeta-
tion) are then compared in terms of their relationship to each other and criteria for defining
relative areas of potential may then be ascertained. (50)

Klippel, Walter E. and William B. Turner (Tennessee) PREHISTORY AND HOLOCENE LAND SUR-

middie Tennessee has been greatly influenced by changing Holocene environments. Fluvial pro-
cesses as well as colluvial action, for example, have concealed and stratified both rockshelters
and open sites over the past 42,000 years. An assessment of these phenomena, taken in conjunc-
tion with other evidence of environmental dynamics, has resulted in more credible interpretations

of the prehistoric human activity in the area. Natural and cultural depositional episodes at a

stratified multicomponent Archaic shell midden (40ML139) serve as a Case study. (26)

Agricultural and developmental economists have shown that ‘primitive’ economies frequently
react to the opening of new and larger markets by shifts in the organization and magnitude of pro-
duction factors. In the case of Bronze Age Cyprus, the causes of change and innovation apparent
in the archaeological record in the period from about 1700-1500 BC can be explained by appeal-
ing to this formal economic model. Increased production of copper atinear the mines, coupled
with an effective intraisiand transportation system, satisfied the demand for copper from exter-
nal markets and stimulated demographic and cultural changes on the island. (17)

Knight, George C. (Washington, St. Louis) MISSING PERSONS, ARCHAEOLOGY AND FUNC-

sociological and philosophical literature. Philosophers of science allow that functional explana-
tion involves description of needs and their satisfaction. In anthropology and sociology, the ex-
planation makes reference to manifest or latent purposive social action. Functional explanations
in the biological sciences relate more to eviutionary theory—specifically, natural selection. With
an adaptationist concept of culture, archaeology may seem closer to the latter explanatory
framework, especially with regard to structural aspects of the archaeological record. However,
the explanation still requires an inference about social behavior, creating implications that
necessitate a broader philosophical treatment. (32)

ee useful discussions of prehistoric chiefdoms have emphasized origins of economic and

ranked societies, both in the maintenance of social organization and in fluctuations of social
complexity. These internal fluctuations are perhaps and common as any straight-line evolution or
devolution in social complexity and are linked to the interrelationships of ritual and social
organization. Archaeological remains of European Bronze Age societies provide illustrations of
these complex interrelationships. Further, these data and interpretations suggest pragmatic
ways of evaluating the often difficult evidence of prehistoric religion. (3)

Site prediction. Selection and application of appropriate data categories and techniques is not
simply a methodological matter but must be fully grounded in theory. For a phenomena to be suc-
cessfully predictable, it is necessary that it be produced by an underlying regular process. Loca-
tion choice theory addresses the processural regularities of the behavioral context of settlement
location selection. Application of choice theory based settlement prediction is considered, using
two major studies from the Midwest and Southeast. (50)
Lindsay, Alexander J., Jr. (Arizona, Tucson) EXPLAINING AN ANASAZ/ MIGRATION TO EAST-
CENTRAL ARIZONA. Arizona W:10:50 (Arizona State Museum) is a multiple-component, town-
size, Western Pueblo site at Point of Pines, Arizona. A cluster of rooms within this site share
several historical and cultural attributes, called the Maverick Mountain phase. Emil W. Haury
describes this phenomenon as a 13th century migration from the Kayenta-Hopi region to Point of
Pines. The migrants settle and prospered here for about two decades. This era ended with a
catastrophic burning of the migrant settlement, leaving a unique collection of behaviorally sorted
materials. The W:10:50 data are compared with other contexts of similar remains and a model is
proposed to explain the Anasazi migration. (53)
Livingston, S.D. (Washington) MULTISITE FAUNAL ANALYSIS: THE CJDCRP DATA BASE.
Analysis of faunal remains recovered at the Chief Joseph Dam Project in eastern Washington has
yielded a significant faunal data base. Although the project area is limited to those sites adjacent
to the Columbia River, a variety of site types and depositional environments are represented, of-
fering an opportunity to examine some of the theoretical and methodological issues in faunal

future investigations of a broader regional nature. (36)
Lohse, E. S. (Washington) TYPOLOGY AND CHRONOLOGY: A METHODOLOGICAL IMPERATIVE.
Construction of a cultural sequence based on a large collection of projectile points recovered at

and correlation with previously defined types. Traditional attributes of form are used to create 18
morphological types. By plotting the temporal and spatial distribution of these morphological
types and applying multivariate statistical analyses relating formal attributes to sample
specimens from established types, historical types are defined. This differentiation of descriptive
types from historical types facilitates both the recognition of formal variability and the deter-
mination of formal similarity. (36)

Luedtke. B.E. (Massachusetts, Boston) NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MASSACHUSETTS CERAMICS. .
Massachusetts ceramics have proven resistant to typing, in part because of the predominance of |
multicomponent sites and a lack of radiocarbon dated assemblages. This lack of established
types is actually an advantage to Massachusetts archaeologists, because it allows us to ap- -
proach ceramic data without the usual blinders imposed by previously defined categories. This
paper discusses ceramic data from several sites in the lower Merrimack River Valley, using the ‘
assumption that different ceramic attributes are related to totally distinct cultural subsystems |
and that they therefore change at different rates and in response to different pressures. (4)

much retent research. Controversy centers around: 1) the nature of contact and postcontact
changes in aboriginal social and economic systems; 2) explanation of these changes; and 3)
ethnohistoric literature as a mode! of precontact aboriginal settlement-subsistence systems.
Five years of regional surveys of prehistoric and historic settiernent in the lower Connecticut

change are inadequate. Qualitative and quantitative tests of ethnohistorically derived models for
both the Late Woodland and Contact periods indicate that while European trade and settiement
are important factors in influencing aboriginal cultures at this time, they are inadequate explana-
tions of the changes observed in the archaeological record. Apparently, some changes in
aboriginal trade networks and settlement-subsistence systems during the Late and terminal Late
Woodland periods were the result of processes independent of European contact. Processes
associated with contact further modified settlement and subsistence patterns. (4)

using sea ice as an extension of the land and hunting sea mammals as the only major food
resource of the winter season. The use of boats and pelagic hunting became important only with
Eskimo immigration about AD 1000. Important changes in both Paleo-Eskimo and Eskimo adapta-

Muller, J. and J. Stephens (IMinois, Carbondale) MISSISSIPPIAN AND ITS FRONTIERS. A unitary
concept of Mississippian has obscured the variation in social and economic organization of
Mississippian societies. A more profitable approach to understanding Mississippian societies is
to examine them in terms of the local environmental conditions that led to their development.
Northern Mississippian societies show patterns that are significantly different in scale and
organization from more “central” Mississippian societies. Eastern Mississippian societies in
Tennessee and Kentucky are also distinct from the Mississippian societies of the Ohio and
Lower Mississippi valleys. Some hypotheses about Mississippian variation and local en-
vironments are presented and related to differences in settlement pattern and organization. (6)

CENT SAMPLE!? In 1977 and 1978, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Seattle District, sponsored
4 National Register eligibility testing program for prehistoric sites at the Chief Joseph Dam proj-
ect in north-central Washington. The program estimated the cost of data recovery at 18
prehistoric habitation sites. But the data recovery fieldwork proved that analysis and reporting
costs had been underestimated by about half. Quantities of recovered artifacts greatly exceeded
projections from survey counts. This variance may be the result of low sampling intensity and
small cell size in the face of clustered artifact dispersion. implications of these findings for
testing programs designed to develop data recovery estimates are explored. (36)

earlier Basketmaker periods the pit structure was used as a primary habitation facility. In the
later Pueblo periods there was an increase in residential density which resulted in the need for in-

from pit structures occupied during these periods provides an interesting test of assumptions
about the changing use of these facilities. (24)

Modern cultural evolutionary theory is dominated by the band-tribe-chiefdom-state paradigm. The
concept of the chiefdom has been applied to Poverty Point, Hopewell and Middle Mississippian.
The implications of this use of the chiefdom concept for three structurally different systems
reveal either: 1) the meaningless of the concept anda major flaw in the band-tribe-chiefdom-state
paradigm; 2) one of them is a chiefdom and the other two are something else; or 3) they are all
complex ranked systems requiring taxa enlargement. This dilemma can be resolved through the
use of Steward's concept of the cross-cultural type. The more complex taxonomic system
generated. will allow the development of a different mode! of cultural evolutionary theory,

FLOOD PLAIN OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPE A PEDOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. Pedological
studies of cultural sites in the Tombigbee River flood plain have revealed well-developed
paleosols and unique soll morphology related to prolonged cultural disturbance. Paleosols
buried by fluvial sediments indicate discrete periods of pedogenic stability in a current fluvial en-

by fluvial sediments. These soils are readily distingushed by thick, humus rich, dark reddish-

period in contrast to soil exposed on residual features which reflect cumulative effects. (26)

developing an historic preservation planning policy to meet the requirements of the National
Historic Preservation Act of 1966, as amended. This policy seeks to incorporate the protection of
: significant archaeological sites into the military mission and the Army's land-use policy. Army
regulations define the planning components and sequences of activites that lead to: 1) legally
and scientifically responsible scopes of work; 2) archaeology performance standards; and 3)
education of Army staff to archaeological values. The Army's goal is to achieve compliance with
public laws through the implementation of land management strategies appropriate to the
significance of identified or predicted sites and cultural systems and to the specific impact of
Army activities upon those cultural resources. (13)

PHYTOLITH ANALYSES TO ARCHAEOLOGY. Phytolith analyses have significant potential in en-
vironmental and agricultural reconstructions. Among the major problems facing researchers are:
1) the lack of an adequate morphological! classification of phytoliths and a common system for
description of phytolith morphology; 2) the need for a better understanding of morphological varia-

lack of knowledge about natural geographic variation in phytolith assemblages; 5) the lack of ade-
quate reference collections and data banks; and 6) counting statistics. (51)
Rasson, J. (Wilkes) DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTERACTION SPHERE IN CENTRAL YUGOSLAVIA.
The interpretation of the Bosnian-Dalmatian Neolithic can be extended to intergroup relations in
Stateless societies in general. Three stages of development are seen: 1) low rates of interaction
seen in both trade goods and shared artifact styles (ceramics); 2) increasing rates of interaction,
understood as communication through symbols; and 3) high rates of interaction in other aspects
of material culture. Such interaction spheres are discussed in terms of energy costs, and their
eventual replacement is explained in terms of trade-off between social complexity and
maintenance of the interaction sphere. (47)
Rathje, W. L. and G. D. Stone (Arizona) DILUTION IS NOT THE SOLUTION: COMMENTS ON AR:
CHAEOLOGICAL THEORY AND THE PUBLIC. Although the public maintains a high level of in-
terest in the topic of extinct cultures, anthropological archaeologists have generally failed to
make accessible their most interesting ideas, and have thus allowed ideas from other disciplines
as well as from pseudoscholars to gain the public ear. Archaeologists need not focus on exotic
artifacts, tall tales or human interest stories to captivate the public imagination; the rephrasing
of many of the issues and theories with which we are actually concerned can and should provide
the basis of healthy rapport with the lay audience. Examples are given of how recent ar-
chaeological thinking on such topics as societal collapse and the rise of elites can be stated so
as to be accessible yet not unduly diluted. (55)

level and shifts in mortuary practice can now be documented. Comparisons are made between
practices at this low-status compound and those at La Ventilla B and Tetitia, both of which are
closer to the main ceremonial center and of distinctly higher status. (30)

broad patterns of spatial use at the level of whole social/cultural systems a5 represented through

DUCING GROUPS. Archaeologists have made almost no attempt to employ models based on op-

current debate about Western Plains Crow pottery, the date of certain ceramic attributes and the
nature of grassland adaptation in general. (21)
Reid, Geral (Massachusetts, Amherst) “. . - TO CUT OFF THE ARMS OF OUR ENEMIES”:
RETHINKING NATIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE FUR TRADE. The ecological perspective that
dominates the study of hunter-gatherers in the Northeast leads to the perhaps erroneous conclu-
sion that a breakdown of native society preceded the development of the fur trade. While local
ecological relations were important, there is justification for greater emphasis on long-distance
interaction during prehistoric times. This paper overcomes some limitations of the ecological
perspective and suggests a more complex and dynamic pattern for native society. This has impor-
tant implications for understanding native participation in the fur trade. These issues are ex-
plored in a general way and with specific reference to the Montagnais. (19)

Reitz, E.J. (Georgia) USE OF ESTUARINE RESOURCES BY HISTORIC PEOPLES. Analysis of
zooarchaeological data from two Spanish 16th century sites indicates that use of estuarine
resources was not the same at both places. St. Augustine, Florida, is located in a Carolina Pro-
vince estuary, while Puerto Real, Haiti, is located in a Caribbean setting. Estuarine and terrestrial
resources are different at both places, as are parameters affecting domestic livestock. These dif-
ferences required adaptations in the colonial subsistence strategies. At St. Augustine, sub-
sistence followed an aboriginal pattern while at Puerto Real it did not. These strategies are
discussed in energetic terms and a predictive model! for colonial coastal subsistence |s offered.

Rensberger, B. (Science 82) WHAT MAKES ARCHAEOLOGY NEWS? Sixteen years as a science
writer for newspapers (mainly The New York Times) and an editor (Science 82) have shown that
stories on the human past are among the most popular. In a sense, the best reason for doing ar-
chaeology is to informand enlighten the public. But not every archaeological development makes
a good story. If the ancient peoples don't come alive through the words or if the old ways of life
can’t be related to today’s, the stories won't appeal broadly. In that case, archaeologists end up
only talking to themselves. (55)

ARTIFACTS. Two classes of nonutilitarian artifacts are defined: 1) status items, artifacts used to
enhance or display the status of an individual or group; 2) ritual items, artifacts necessary in the
ritual or religious activities of a society. It is argued that these two classes of artifacts will be
distributed in very different ways within and between archaeological sites. Status items will be
Gistributed very unevenly; ritual items will be distributed more evenly. The implications of these
artifact distributions for the nature and purpose of exchange networks are discussed, The
distribution of Hopewellian artifacts, along with supporting ethnographic data, is used to il-

Stimulate a Southwestern renascence which saw material goods and new ideas spread
throughout the region. Both the renascence and its debt to Mesoamerica can be documented in
the archaeology of protohistoric sites and in the writings of 16th century Spanish explorers. The
greater Southwestern frontier of Mesoamerica was eventually destroyed by introduced European

Rindos, David (lilinois, Urbana) FITNESS AND ADAPTATION IN EVOLUTIONARY THEORY.
Fitness and adaptation are central concepts in natural selection theory. Divergent interpretation
of these concepts are examined, especially as they relate to the explanation of evolutionary
change. Consideration is given the use of these concepts by major anthropological schools {in-
cluding cultural evolutionism, cultural ecology, sociobiology and cultural selectionism). It is
concluded that adaptation, per se, is a poor indicator for understanding cultural change and that

large portion of the Middle to Late Formative Maya site of Komchen, Yucatan, was mapped and

Komchen was revealed as a densely settled town with some of the earliest monumental architec-
ture in the lowlands. Data are limited almost wholly to architecture and ceramics, with few elite

disparities in wealth and social status. Problems include defining and delimiting households.

the origin of enclosures may lie in late Adena times; 2) the primary motivation for their construc-

separated from the sediments of 40 archaeologial sites in the New World. Light and scanning
electron microscopy was used in the analysis of the archaeological biosilica and an extensive
comparative collection of modern analogues. An exotic "known" was added to samples during
processing, allowing the calculation of the concentration of diagnostic biosilica types per gram
and cubic cantimeter of sediment. These relative frequencies were used to construct spectra and
diagrams which allow comparison of biosilica assemblages, influx values and the reconstruction
of environments. This paper summarizes the results of six years of research. (39)

these materials were available in the immediate area, others were procured from more distant

results especially when used in conjunction with complementary archeobotanical techniques.

However, sampling strategies must conform to unique aspects of phytolith origin, deposition and

taphonomy, Successes and shortcomings in current case studies suggest procedures in survey

and testing, site evaluation and excavation. Results can contribute to assessment of site
significance whether determining potential for problem-oriented projects or elibigility for Na-

the earthlodges. This sequence of events is repeated at various Savannah, Wilbanks and Pisgah

within the context of a small burial vessel, contained an extremely high proportion of a thus far

unidentified type of pollen which may belong to the Solanaceae family. (30)

the group rather than individual level in complex human societies is questioned. The identifica-
tion of the individual as the principal unit of reproductive striving has been a major stimulus for
recent advances in evolutionary theory. This emphasis would require the archaeologist to focus
attention upon the relative reproductive benefits that accrue to individuals as members of com-
plex societies in specific environments. The application of this approach is discussed by
reference to empirical data on the rise of trading states from pastoral-nomadic societies in the
ancient Near East. (48)

resolved through an understanding of the different treatment accorded these two materials. An
examination of the patterns of utilization in two sets of bone tools, one from early Neolithic
Bulgaria, the other from middle-late Neolithic Serbia, helps to illuminate the economic distinc-
tion between the two periods. A comparison with stone tools reveals that economic change is not
evenly reflected in different raw materials. (47)

Salmon, M. H. (Pittsburgh) THE PRINCIPLE OF EFFICIENCY. To reconstruct prehistoric behavior,
archaeologists infer physical activity from material remains and then infer the meaning of the ac-

from dubious to tautological. This paper examines critically the meaning, utility and legitimacy of

Recently discovered ethnohistorical sources demonstrate that in the northern Andes (modern

corps of status traders (mindalaes) resembling Aztec pochteca and circulation of wealth objects
which in some respects functioned as currency. These institutions, seemingly contradictory of In-

Oaxaca and Tuxtlas Region indicate shifts in SOUICE Utilization and trading Strategies through
time. Several distribution Systems operated simultaneously, each producing complementary
products. These data confirm the dendritic model and illustrate that Significant variablity existed
among obsidian Production/distribution systems and in the Organization of ancient
politicoeconomies. (11)

Savulis, E. R. (Massachusetts, Amherst) FROM DOMESTIC TO INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION: A
REEVALUATION OF WOMEN'S WORK, 1780-1830. Numerous interpretations exist of the cultural
changes which occurred in the United States during the late 48th and early 19th centuries. Deetz
treated this as a shift from a pre-Renaissance to a Renaissance “mindset.” Others view this as a
product of intensification and/or shift to capitalist economic relations. These approaches are in-
adequate because they fail to consider differential effects of culture change on men and women.
This paper investigates some of the theoretical implications that a consideration of gender has
for the study of inequality during this period. It suggests that changes in women's work are sen-
sitive indicators of changing relations in a capitalist society and are likely to be visible within ar-
chaeological contexts. (19)

Schiffer, M. B. (Arizona, Tucson) WHO NEEDS A PHILOSOPHY OF ARCHAEOLOGY? The need for
a philosophy of archaeology has recently become a topic of some contention. It has been ad-
vocated recently (Schiffer, American Antiquity 48:899-908) that a philosophy of archaeology might
develop through collaboration between archaeologists and philosophers of science. The present
paper explores another viable option for which there is ample precedent: the philosophical
analysis of archaeological problems by archaeologists. Current issues in the study of formation
processes, amenable to philosophical analysis, illustrate this strategy for contributing to 4
philosophy of archaeology. The claim by some that archaeology does not need homegrown
philosophers is shown to be both counterproductive and anti-intellectual. (32)

Schortman. E. M. and P. A. Urban (Kenyon) SURVEY ALONG INDIANFIELD RUN, KNOX COUNTY,
OHIO. Knox County in central Ohio is little-touched archaeologically. What is known about areal
prehistory focuses on the Kokosing River flood plain, where survey work is usually concentrated.
Breaking with this trend, a four-week intensive foot survey of a small Kokosing tributary, Indian-
field Run, reveals an unexpectedly large concentration of sites datable to the Paleoindian
through Late Archaic periods. Lithic materials are principally from the nearby Nellie flint source,
but some items are from the more distant Flint Ridge quarries. The apparently anomalous density |
of occupation recorded may be due to the area’s proximity to the Nellie source, and the possible
use of the Run as a corridor of movement to and from it. Future research along this and other
local drainages will test such hypotheses about site location and questions of function as well. |

were storage facilities, A Production, use, reuse, discard model for refuse-filied pits is proposed,
considering storage, Processing and soil recovery needs in terms of soil characteristics, time
(time needed, time to Produce and duration of use), labor and technology. The model Suggests
that individual refuse-filled pits may have served multiple purposes and that morphological

the successes and failures of such attempts. It is argued that archaeology's greatest value to

Stewart, R. M. (Berger and Associates) and J. F. Custer (Delaware) MARITIME ADAPT ATIONS IN
THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. Review of Middle Atlantic
region coastal adaptations centers around three themes. First, only ephemeral use of coastal
resources predates ca. 6000 BC due to effects of relatively rapid post-Pleistocene Sea level rise
on estuarine environments and the patterns of human subsistence activities. Second, by ca, 3000
BC intensive utilization of coastal resources began in a response to the effects of the mid- |
postglacial xerothermic climatic interval and stabilization of estuarine environments, In some
locations, incipient ranked Societies were supported by these intensive coastal adaptations. i
Third, horticulture Supersedes intensive coastal resource utilization ca. AD 1000 in most areas
and supported true ranked societies and complex tribal organizations. (44)
Stocker, T. (Illinois, Urbana) and B. Jackson (Missouri) THE GULF COAST SHELL AND THE
HIGHLAND SWORD. The ruling class of highland Mesoamerican states controlled some portion
of the lithic industry for at least two reasons. In the first place, constant incoming tribute required
@ military organization. The production, Storage and distribution of military hardware were State
concerns. For example, each macuahitl, an obsidian-lined Sword, required 10 obsidian blades.
The second reason for State control of lithic resources is that status symbols were required by
the elite. Seashells are one status item detected in the archaeological record. The half conch was
worn by the high priest of the Quetzalcoatl cult. Some obsidian traded to the coast was to procure
Shell for the highland elite. (11)

Development of prehistoric polities on Ponape in the Eastern Caroline Islands may have been
strongly influenced through the presence of. access to and control over marine faunal and
molluscan resources and jagoonal physiographic features. Archaeological and ethnoar-
chaeological research was performed to test for the presence of a polity in the southwestern por-

development of this polity-Kepihleng and that it was at least partly contemporaneous with that
polity exemplified by the megalithic site at Nan Madol. (2)

evolutionary context, two models of cultural transmission (vertical and oblique transmission be-

based on transmission are reviewed to see if they can predict the patterns of changes in historic

ratios of the figure’s height, the length of the arm-stretch and the width of the waist. These
prehistoric canons anticipate those of the Classical period by nearly four millennia. The early ex-
istence of such a formula raises important questions regarding Neolithic production of stone
figurines and possible communication among craftsmen. Several explanations are offered to ac-
count for the appearance of this canon at different sites throughout southern Greece and the

vegetation change, but rather appear to be the result of sorting during water transport or slope
wash activity. Additional problems may be caused by the redeposition of pollen from older
sediments in alluvial and colluvial contexts. Surface samples from northeastern Arizona provide
evidence that the pollen content of alluvium may reflect upstream vegetational assemblages
rather than the vegetation surrounding the sample site. (8)

regional factors and inadequate archaeological research on the Pacific coast of Mesoamerica at
present severely restrict the possibility of generating a clear and reliable picture of prehistoric
maritime adaptations within this region. This paper identifies specific regional factors that may
have been significant for West Coast Mesoamerican inhabitants and reviews what is now known
about continuity and change in maritime adaptations. (44)
Voytek, Barbara (California, Berkeley) THE DOMESTIC MODE OF PRODUCTION IN NEOLITHIC
SOUTHEAST EUROPE. The concept of the Domestic Mode of Production (DMP) is useful to the
Study of Neolithic societies. The hypothesis is that the DMP is not a static pattern maintained
throughout this period. Rather, changes in the nature of production and consumption units pro-
duced variation in labor Supply and demand, and affected impetus for social change in later
periods. Early and Middle Neolithic cultures of the Danube Basin are compared and contrasted
with those of the Aegean/South Bulgarian region in terms of production modes, especially as
these concern lithic resources. The dynamics and conflicts within domestic production may be
seen as the bases for socioeconomic change during the Neolithic. (3)
Waddell, D. B. (Arkansas Archeological Survey) AN ANALYSIS OF THE SELECTION OF AT-
TRIBUTES FOR PREDICTIVE MODELING OF SITE LOCATION. Predictive modeling of prehistoric
Site patterning does not require the development of bridging arguments between data and theory
for selection of attributes. One needs only to assume that there exists a hierarchical preference
Set and that geologic processes through time have resulted in uniform transformations within
subsets of the biophysical environment. However, the shift from analysis of settlement pattern-
ing to the analysis of settlement and Subsistence systems does require the development of bridg-
ing arguments that incorporate the structure of the prehistoric environment, the structure of the
cognitive, hierarchically partitioned environment and the degree of coherence between these
two. (50)

Wandsnider, L. (New Mexico) CULTURE CHANGE AND THE MYTH OF POPULATION REGULA-
TION. Neo-Malthusian and Boserupian, as well as multiple feedback hybrid arguments for the
relationship between culture change and population growth have been made. Usually implicit in
these arguments is some notion of population regulation. Reviewed here is evidence consistent
with the idea that populations do not regulate their growth but that people, as individuals,
manage their own reproduction. While the concept of population, an aggregate of individuals,
may be analytically useful, it should not be confused with the concept of systemic behavior of in-
dividuals. Explanations for culture change are reexamined in this light. (22)

SURVEY: SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE IN THE RED ROCK VALLEY DURING THE BASKET-
MAKER III PERIOD. Archaeologists with the Navajo Nation Cultural Resource Management Pro-

This project represents the first intensive study of the prehistory of the area since the investiga-
tion of Basketmaker caves in the Prayer Rock District by Earl and Elizabeth Morris. Seventy-eight
prehistoric components have been recorded by this survey project. Nearly 44% of these date to
the Basketmaker III period. Interpretations are drawn based on the comparison of these sites to
others of the Red Rock Valley area, particularly those of the Prayer Rock District. (53)

Watson, P. J. (Washington, St. Louis) and M. A. Wylie (Calgary) THE PROSPECTS FOR
PHILOSOPHICAL ANALYSIS IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Two recent publications by archaeologists
(Flannery, American Anthropologist 84:267-278; Schiffer, American Antiquity 46:899-908) have
established partially conflicting positions about the desirability of applying philosophical
analysis to archaeological concerns. To Schiffer, philosophers of science are invited to learn
more from archaeologists so that better philosophy and, in particular, 4 philosophy of ar-
chaeology (on the model of philosophy of biology or history) will result. Flannery, on the other
hand admonishes archaeologists to stick to their trowels and leave philosophy alone because
the effects of philosophy on archaeology have been deleterious. Clarke (Antiquity 44:238) has
argued that overt attention to the philosophical aspects of archaeological! practice is essential.
This paper presents evidence in support of Clarke's position. (32)

reanalysis of the earliest Paleoindian sites known in eastern North America, alternative possible

are presented. These hypotheses are compared for clarification with current knowledge of
earliest Australasian settlement patterns. Tentative predictions are made for research strategies
which might prove more productive in the future than have some past approaches. (54)
Webster, David L. (Penn State) RURAL SETTLEMENT SURVEY IN THE COPAN VALLEY. A major
objective of the current Copan Archaeological Project is the survey of rural areas of the Copan
drainage outside the main pocket where the site of Copan itself is located. Earlier surveys have
located 3,400 structures In the latter area; at present, 30%-40% of the rest of the drainage is be-
ing sampled to complete the settlement survey. The survey methodology is a modified version of
that used in the Basin of Mexico, with heavy reliance on large-scale aerial photography to define
survey units. Ecological and ethnographic information—particularly focused on modern land
us¢—is also being collected. A program of test pitting will provide chronological control. Over 70
km* already have been surveyed. Rural areas of the Copan drainage appear to have much lower
population densities and a much simpler settlement hierarchy than does the main pocket. (52)

WESTERN MEXICO. A non-Olmec, non-Teotihuacan architectural settlement and mortuary com-
plex has been defined for the Formative and Classic periods in western Mexico. The center of
development was the Etzatlan-Teuchitlan-Tequila area of Jalisco and adjoining Nayarit. Com-
pounds composed of concentric circles characterize the Teuchitlan tradition, Each compound
consists of a circular pyramid Surrounded by elevated circular patios which, in turn, are surround-
ed by circular banquettes/platforms. Atop the platforms are between eight and 16 rectangular
platforms. The minimal principles of geometry applied to designing these complex circles are
discussed. Possible ceremonial implications of the concentric circles are explored. (41 )

MESOAMERICA. Mining for turquoise during the pre-contact period was performed on a far
greater scale in northwest Mesoamerica than the current literature Suggests. The scale of ac-
quisition (mining, transport) and associated artisanry requires a reinterpretation of southwestern
archaeological economies, The Braudel model of “trade Structure” will be discussed. Long-
distance exchange for turquoise was regular and Systematic. This exchange is being quantified
by a joint project between Brookhaven National Laboratory and SUNY, Stony Brook. Results of
the neutron activation source/artifact analysis are discussed. (45)
Wells, Peter S. (Harvard) IRON, TRADE AND THE GROWTH OF TOWNS IN EARLY IRON AGE
SLOVENIA. Large, fortified settlements were first established in Slovenia (northwest Yugoslavia)
in the 8th century BC. These settlements, such as Stiéna, Magdalenskagora and Vace grew rapid-
ly into substantial towns much larger than any earlier Communities in the area and became
centers of commerce and metal working. The sudden appearance of these commercial towns can
be explained by local development of iron metallurgy and trade systems to bring iron to Italy and
other regions. (3)

Whalen, Michael E. (Tulsa) RECONSTRUCTION OF A PUEBLO PERIOD EXCHANGE SYSTEM IN
SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO. An early Pueblo site in south-central New Mexico is notable for its
nonlocal Mimbres ceramic assemblage and for the thousands of stone beads collected there.
The site is interpreted to be what economic geographers term a “gateway community” in a den-
dritic (branching) network focusing on the Mimbres area of southwestern New Mexico. It is shown
that the site lies astride a major trade network extending out of the Mimbres area. Dendritic ex-
change networks and gateway communities are found in many primitive economic systems. and
it lS argued that such a structure is best suited to the Pueblo period’s demographic configuration
and general level of complexity. (53)

White, Randall (New York) TOWARD REGIONAL STUDIES IN THE EUROPEAN PALEOLITHIC:
THE COMPLEX CASE OF THE PERIGORD. Historically, European Paleolithic archaeology has
focused on research at the local or site level to the practical exclusion of settlement or land-use
Studies. The potential rewards of broader regional studies are Stated. Primary field research in
the Perigord is used to emphasize these knowledge gaps especially as they concern formation,
alteration and visibility of the archaeological record. The Perigord data base provides excellent
ammunition for the argument that future research must give priority to. a detailed understanding
of natural (e.g., geological), cultural (€.g., reforestation) and archaeological (e.g., Sampling) forces
which flavor current perceptions of the regional record. (58)

Whittaker. John C. (Arizona) and Kathryn A. Kamp (Grinnell) THE ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL
STUDY OF STONE TOOLS. The uses of ethnoarchaeology for studying stone tools are discussed.
There are few places today where stone tools are part of a functioning culture, but early reports
and collections provide a useful resource. Experimental studies are better for interpreting a wider
range of tool uses and manufacturing techniques, but ethnoarchaeology caniake other con-
tributions: 1) joining experiment with ethnography strengthens both; 2) the few surviving lithic in-
dustries must be studied now; 3) most of these survivors are reduced to a few tool types produced
by specialists—a situation worth studying; and 4) some aspects of the social place of specialized
crafts and of stone tool production in general are most approachable through study of the early
records and surviving industries. (43)
Widmer, Randolph J. (Penn State) CRAFT SPECIALIZATION AT TLAJINGA 33, TEOTIHUACAN.
Recent extensive, fine-scaled excavations in a Teotihuacan apartment compound, Tlajinga
33:51W3, have documented two temporaily distinct craft specializations spanning the period
300-700 AD. These activities are lapidary and ceramic production. The techniques and evidence
utilized to identify these specializations are discussed. Lapidary production is not specialized in
material or specific item. but focuses instead on the production of a variety of artifacts in a
number of media, including shell, malachite, serpentine, jadeite, travertine and slate. Ceramic
production is confined to the last phase of the occupation and is focused on the production of
San Martin Orange for the market. (30)
Wigen, R. (Victoria) HOKO RIVER ROCKSHELTER FAUNAL RESOURCES. The fauna from the
Hoko River Rockshelter indicates that the resource collection was heavily marine oriented. Fish
were the major faunal resource (exclusive of shellfish); over 90% of the identified bones (ca.
20,000) are fish remains. The main species are rocky bottom fishes and salmon, with locally abun-
dant rocky bottom fishes predominating. Sea mammals are the most commonly recovered mam-
mals. and the northern tur seal is the single most “important” species of this group. Fur seals are
rarely found in the Strait of Juan de Fuca today. Vertical variations in the faunal assemblage ap-
pear to correlate with variations in layer types. (42)
Wilcox, David R. (Arizona State Museum) THE TEPIMAN CONNECTION. The closest and most
specific cultural connections linking the American Southwest and Mesoamerica have been
documented between the Hohokam and Chalchihuites cultures. A model is proposed to explicate
the emergence-and changing structure of this relationship. The differential adoption of seden-
tism and pottery from Durango to the Southwest ca. AD 200 may have restructured communica-
tion networks among indigenous hunter-gatherers, partitioning the Tepiman dialect chain from
the rest of Uto-Aztecan. Maintenance of the continuity of communication along this Tepiman cor-
ridor presumably persisted until the advance of coastal Sinaloan culture (see at Guasave) led toa
restructuring of Southwest-Mesoamerican relations. (45)
Wilk, R. R. (California, Santa Cruz) HOUSES AS ARTIFACTS. As with other artifacts, houses both
reflect and take part in social systems. Also, like pot sherds or jade carvings, the distribution and
frequency of house remains is affected by the processes which form the archaeological record
and modify it after deposition. Houses can be discarded, curated, reused or scavenged. What one
observes is not a simple reflection of the dwellings in use at a single time. This paper discusses
systematic biases in the archaeological record of housing and the ways these biases have af-
fected models of Maya population and social structure, Remedies are proposed. (7)
Wilkie, Duncan C. (Southeast Missouri State) A SHALL GORGET IN A SMALL VILLAGE CONTEXT.
Examination of in situ artifacts from a small Mississippian village suggests that a shell gorget
may have been used in a wider context than as a burial offering. There appears to be a
social/utilitarian component as well as the more obvious religious/ceremonial function to the
gorget. The archaeological context has offered an opportunity to reexamine the simplistic notion
of “ceremonial objects" which is often used in archaeological reconstructions. (38)

Two extensively excavated Savannah River phase sites on the Upper Savannah River in Georgia
and South Carolina are compared and contrasted. Both sites exhibit numerous activity areas in
undisturbed midden contexts. The analysis of activity areas, material Culture and the availability
of natural resources at each site leads to the conclusion that one site, 38AN29, functioned as a
Specialized hunting and gathering station while the other, 9EB21, probably represents a multitask
basecamp. The analysis of the two sites is a step toward understanding the settlement and sub-
sistence system of the Late Archaic period in the Southeastern Piedmont. (56)

valley floor at 7,000 ft. Further, terraces and plots commonly reach elevations of 8,000 ft, or the
upper limits of farming capability. Apparently, the northern Rio Grande Anasazi had adapted crop
plants to these conditions by at least AD 950. Evidence for the organizational system that sup-

BEHAVIOR: THE LOWRANCE EXAMPLE. The Lowrance site (34Mr-10), a Protohistoric (ca. AD

Such cache, Special Collection 2, contained 146 flakes and 10 chipped stone tools. Color, texture,
cortex and light transmission differences allowed these 156 pieces to be sorted and attributed to
30 different cobbles. By refitting flakes and tools, it was possible to discern knapping Strategies

Wylie, M. A. (Calgary) THE DILEMMA OF INTERPRETATION: INUIT ETHNOGRAPHY AND THE
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD. The philosophical tensions inherent in contemporary archaeology
are nowhere clearer than in its ambivalence about the relevance of ethnographic research to ar-
chaeological interpretation; ethnoarchaeology is a booming industry yet the disagreement
escalates about how or even whether its results can be effectively employed in interpretation.
The history of developing and changing interest in Inuit ethnography among archaeologists is ex-
amined as a case where clearcut methodological intuitions have emerged about how such data
might be applied to interpretive problems, but where systematic formulation has been com-
promised by programmatic commitment to a positivist epistemology. (32)

AMERICAN BOTTOM: A FUNCTIONAL STUDY OF THE SHELL-WORKING INDUSTRY AT
SELECTED SITES IN THE CAHOKIA SETTLEMENT SYSTEM. Microwear analysis of chert
microdrills from several localities at the Cahokia site indicated these tools were almost ex-
clusively used to drill shell material. Many archaeologists believe the Cahokia microdrills were
used to produce the numerous shell disc beads that are found at Mississippian burial and habita-
tion sites in the American Bottom region. Bead production may have been the work of: 1) fulltime
craft specialists at workshops on the larger sites; 2) parttime artisans at small Mississippian
sites who were part of an incipient cottage industry. New data from sites excavated by the
FAI-270 Project have been used to study the shell-working industry and to examine the nature of
craft specialization on the American Bottom. (6)

southwestern Maine, located at outlets and other areas that would have maximized harvesting of
anadromous fish, The sample includes a number of projectile points of both “Stark” and
“Neville” types as defined by Dincauze. Discriminant analysis is used to assess the assignment
of points to these typological categories as well as to assess the integrity and meaning of the
categories themselves. These data are used to reconstruct early Holocene lacustrine adaptations in
southwestern Maine and are compared to related materials from elsewhere in the Northeast. (4)

Yi, Seonbok (Arizona State) and G. A. Clark ON THE “DYUKTAI CULTURE” AND NEW WORLD
ORIGINS. The chronology and affinities of the “Dyuktai Culture,” an Upper Paleolithic
assemblage from northeast Siberia are discussed, and Mochanov's (1969, 1973, 1978) hypotheses
on the peopling of the Americas are reassessed. Examination of geoarchaeological and
chronometric data suggests that Dyuktai assemblages are not older than mid-Lower Sartan
Glacial (ca. 18,000 BP) and are substantially younger than reported in the Russian literature.
Since Dyuktai assemblages are often linked to the Paleo-Arctic tradition, the reassessment af-
fects ideas about New World human origins. An origin in north China is indicated by comparison
of Dyuktai assemblages with those from the Chinese sites of Hutouliang, Xiachuan and Shiyu.
The possibility of the existence of pre-Sartan assemblages in northeast Siberia is suggested. (58)
Young, D. E. (Edmonton) and R. Bonnichsen (Maine, Orono) THE ROLE OF STONE TOOL
REPLICATION EXPERIMENTS IN THE MUNSUNGUN LAKE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
PROJECT. Stone too! production systems are frequently reconstructed through the use of uncon-
. trolled inferential analogues (e.g., historical accounts) and by imitative behavioral analogues
(e.g., a flintknapper’s experience). Recent cognitive research indicates that the individual crafts-
man links cognition and behavior into production codes (units plus rules) for creating material
products. An archaeological application of this approach illustrates how a reference collection of
flake scars in which the linkage between behavior and attribute combinations is known can be
used to reconstruct technological systems. (40)
Zier, Christian J. (Metcalf-Zier Archaeologists, Inc.) IMPLICATIONS FOR GROWTH AND
DEVELOPMENT OF CLASSIC MAYA COMMUNITIES IN WESTERN EL SALVADOR. Studies inthe
Zapotitan Valley indicate accelerated population growth following an initial occupational hiatus
resulting from the ca. 3rd century AD eruption of llopango volcano. Population growth is
associated with increasing nucleation of settlements by the Late Classic period. Analyses of site
function and locational characteristics suggest pan-valley political cohesion, possibly coexis-
tent with localized semiautonomy among larger settlements. Hypothesized arable land shortages
and related developments of land tenure patterns are believed to account in part for localized
political power within the overall valley system. (41)
