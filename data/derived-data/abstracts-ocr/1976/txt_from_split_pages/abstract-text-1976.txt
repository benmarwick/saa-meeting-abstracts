ABSTRACTS OF ORGANIZED SYMPOSIA
(1) THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSERVATION ACT: RETROSPECT AND PROS-
PECT. Passage of Public Law 93-291 (the Moss-Bennett Act) in May 1974 stimulated
an abundance of speculation by American archaeologists about the impact that the Act
would have on the field. Two years later it is possible to review the real impact that the Act
has had upon archaeology in the United States. In addition, it is important to discuss the
various activities needed within the next two years in order to insure that the bill be
continued when it comes up for review in 1978. It is important to show that archaeologists
in America can respond effectively to this important legistative opportunity that has been
provided by the American public.
(2) ARCHAEOLOGY AND PALEOQECOLOGY AT MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER:
AN INTERIM STATEMENT. Meadowcroft rocksheiter is a deeply stratified, multi-
component site in Washington County, Pennsylvania. The 11 well defined stratigraphic units
isolated at the site span at least 16,000 and perhaps 19,000 years of intermittent occupation
by groups representing all of the major cultural stages/periods now recognized in
northeastern North America. The salient features of the geology, archaeology, and
paleoecology of this site are summarized on the basis of data accrued and processed through '
the termination of the 1975 excavation season. Since there are two more field seasons
scheduled at the site, the data presented most needs to be considered subject to future
modification.
(3) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF RESIDENCE: SOME EXAMPLES FROM PRE-
COLUMBIAN MESOAMERICA. The symposium reflects a growing interest in the
excavation of non-ceremonial sectors of Pre-Columbian communities in an attempt to gain
further knowledge of non-hieratic aspects of Mesoamerican culture. The participants will
present data based upon excavations of residential remains from a wide variety of settlement
types and ranging in time from the Preciassic to the Postclassic periods.
(5) THE RECONSTRUCTION OF DIET FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE. The
papers will present examples of the application of techniques used in paleonutrition with
only a brief discussion of methodology. These contributions will be theoretical in nature
explaining the methods of the technique and range of its application. These will include
analysis of faunal, flora, skeletal, and cultural evidence.
(6) THE STUDY OF PREHISTORY: A BIO-ARCHAEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. The
development of complex models of bjo-cultural change requires the integration of data
derived from a diversity of research fields. One means of facilitating the refinement of such
models is to direct, within a geographic region, expertise reflecting the biological, social, and
environmental sciences toward a common set of research goals. The 15,000 square kilometer
area of the lower I\linois River region is an ideal laboratory for the development of
interdisciplinary research strategies directed toward questions of prehjstoric social organiza-
tion, demography, bio-social relationships, and adaptive efficiency. The numerous archae-
ological sites in the area document the exploitation of a rich natural environment, and
reflect marked cultural diversity through time. Thus, it is possible to trace the interaction of
biological, cultural, and environmental variables through extensive series of temporally
sequential populations. This symposium details the complex bio-cultural changes which
define the Woodland and Mississippian periods for the lower Illinois region.
(7) VARIETIES OF NON-AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENT AND SOCIAL ORGANIZA-
TION: A VIEW FROM PREHISTORIC NORTH AMERICA. In spite of considerable recent
research into hunter-gatherer social and settlement systematics, a tendency to think of
non-agricultural societies as invariably being egalitarian bands continues to be observable
among anthropologists and especially archaeologists. This symposium examines archaeolog-
ical and related ethnographic evidence bearing on the amount of variability actually present
among North American nor-agriculturalists in terms of social and settiement organization. ,
Recent data from watiouws certs of the continent are summarized, and an attempt is made to
project the kin@s of organization oresent usder waryrng conditions at varying times in the
| past.

(9) MIDDLE-LATE WOODLAND CONTINUITY IN NORTHEASTERN NORTH
AMERICA. The rapi changing cultures of the 4D. 400-700 time period in northeastern
North America nave 10n9 been a focal poet of erchacotogical speculation. Anthropological
research into this time per Nas recently ewotwec ipto 2 major field of study within the
area. Symposium reports cover various features of th] cultural order including subsistence
16
, practices, settlement organization, technological innovations, lithic technology, mortuary
practices, and other features essential to the study of structural change in society. Predictive
models are offered which attempt to explain the transitions of the time.
(10) SPANISH COLONIAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN TEXAS AND NORTHEASTERN
MEXICO. Symposium participants will present papers reviewing recent investigations of
Spanish Colonial sites and materials in Texas and northeastern Mexico. One paper will
discuss archaeological excavations at Mission Rosario in southern Texas. A series of four
papers will be devoted to a review of the archaeology, architecture, and ethnohistory of an
cighteenth century Spanish mission complex (San Juan Bautista del Rio Grande) in
northeastern Coahuila. Finally, the preservation and restoration procedures used in treating
artifacts from mid-sixteenth century shipwrecks along the Texas coast will be treated in
detail.
(11) CURRENT INVESTIGATIONS INTO PREHISTORIC CERAMIC TECHNOLOGY.
Over the past several years the total volume of archaeometric analysis techniques available
to the archaeologist has increased dramatically. While this expansion has characterized all
aspects of archaeological research, the range of developments has been especially great in the
proliferation of archaeometric techniques suitable for the analysis of prehistoric ceramic
materials. As a result of these archaeometric developments those archaeologists concerned
with changes in prehistoric ceramic technology have been provided with a wide array of new
variables with which to measure such changes. Although the scope of new techniques
available for the analysis of prehistoric ceramic technology is ever growing, it is hoped that
this symposium, bringing together archaeologists and researchers in the physical sciences,
will serve to draw the attention of the general archaeological community to the more
important aspects of current research into prehistoric ceramic technology.
(13) COMPETITIVE CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY: NEW DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
INTERAGENCY ARCHAEOLOGICAL SERVICES DIVISION PROGRAM, DEPART-
MENT OF THE INTERIOR, NATIONAL PARK SERVICE. The Interagency Archaeological
Service Division's (National Park Service) contracting program will be presented to the
archaeological contracting profession as a revolution in procurement procedures for site
mitigation. Specifically, the revolution is one of significant change in the nature of contract
award, shifting from sole-source to competitive procurement. The philosophy behind this
change is based on three premises: (1) contract procurement of the future must be
conducted in a free and open research market as mandated by the Code of Federal
Regulations (procurement regulations) now On the books; (2) the successful contractor will
be one who submits the most creative problem-oriented research design, not the competitor
with the lowest budget proposal, and finally; (3) competitive proposals for mitigation
contracts will be open to all qualified institutions and organizations without restriction.
(14) MIDDLE AMERICAN COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS. The focus of the symposium is
behavioral patterns and factors affecting them in coastal environments of Middle America.
Substantive, methodological, and theoretical contributions on the topics of subsistence,
economics, demography, and settlement pattern will be included. Both environmental and
social relationships are regarded as relevant to the analysis of Middle American Coastal
ecosystermns,
(15) PALEQETHNOBOTANICAL ROUNDTABLE: THE IDENTIFICATION AND INTER-
PRETATION OF EVIDENCE FOR NATIVE AND INTRODUCED HORTICULTURE IN
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. The evidence for identifying and interpreting
domesticated plants in the Eastern United States will be discussed by the participants of this
roundtable. Both hypothesized indigenous domesticates and introduced cultivars will receive
considerable attention. New methods of identification, alternative models of interpretation,
and directions for future research will be openly Gebated by the participating paleocethno-
botanists. Participants are encouraged to bring perplexing specimens for identification or for
illustrating a particular idea. The importance and implications of associated botanical
evidence charcoal, pollen, phytoliths, etc. will also be reviewed. Questions and comments
from the audience are encouraged.
(16) CORDS, FABRICS, AND BASKETS FROM SITES AND CERAMICS IN NORTH
AMERICA, Prenistoric cords, fabrics, and baskets are regarded by most researchers as an
afterthought or appendix to material culture descriptions from sites throughout the New
World. Singularly successful articles dealing with these preserved phenomena have graced the
literature for over a hundred years. With only rare exceptions have archaeologists sought
confirmation for their conclusions via comparisons across mediums to seek Stylistic keys
whith may unlock social, economic, or settlement patterns which may not conform to
tribal, régional, or ohysiographic areas. Recent analyses of cords, fabrics, and baskets have
become ferminotogically precise, technically accurate and imaginative in seeking smtermal
relationships. There is a paramount need for communication among scholars Worn oF
these “soft items” ane thei Girect transfers to other hard items such as Ceramics, rete
to building facades, or as painted motifs; or as mnemonic keys central to the sookalyouetoral
organization of prehistoric groups.
(17) THE HINDS CAVE PROJECT: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL 2NO SOT Scat STUDY
OF A LARGE DRY ROCKSHELTER IN SOUTHWEST TEX4S. me ehyectwe of this
symposium is to present a series of preliminary reports of She eds Cawe research. These
reports will describe the project objectives, the arctaeatesy. Se Galeoenvironment, the
17
, coprolite (dietary) studies, and plant macrofossil analyses. Hinds Cave is a large
rockshelter-cave site containing more than three meters of a rich deposit of perishable
refuse. It is one of the few such sites that remain in the area of southwest Texas which still
contains vast quantities of undisturbed perishable deposits. Since it is now in immediate
danger of being destroyed by relic collectors, an intensive effort is being conducted to
systematically study the site and its deposits. One excavation season has already been
completed and preliminary analyses of the data indicate that the site contains an
8,000-9,000 year record and has enormous potential for yielding the longest sequence of
plant macrofossil and human coprolite data ever recorded from a site in the American
Southwest. The study involves an extensive interdisciplinary program incorporating
botanists, archaeologists, and nutritionists.
(18) DEVELOPMENT OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SYSTEMS IN PREHISPANIC
ANDES. Models for the development of economic and political systems in Prehispanic Peru
are becoming more complex and sophisticated. Utilization of better field recovery
techniques combined with more thorough laboratory analytical methodologies provides
better data from which to reconstruct the economic support systems of the developing
“civilizations” in Peru. This data in conjunction with other archaeologically recovered
settlement pattern information allows more adequate explanatory Nypotheses concerning
the political institutions used to acquire and manipulate economic goods in the developing
complex societies. Ethnohistorical data is used to provide additional! validating hypotheses.
(19, 20) PHOTOGRAMMETRIC MAPPING AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS. Photo-
grammetry and computer graphics are rapidly changing technical fields which have a great
impact on current archaeological research. This symposium provides a medium for
discussing methods and techniques and disseminating these to the archaeological profession.
The increasing use of computer-aided graphics in conjunction with other spatially related
analytical methods is an aid to understanding behavioral relationships within the
archaeological record. A broad range of topical applications in both photogrammetric and
computer graphic mapping provides a basis for future archaeologica) research.
(21) EXPERIMENTAL REPLICATION, A growing number of independent workers are
involved in Experimenta! Replication. Increasingly sophisticated experiments suggest its
potential in dealing with that which does not ‘survive in the archaeological record, both
process and the bio-degradable majority of material culture. This symposium will present
some examples of this work, with concern for measurement, control, and verification in a
wide variety of areas and interests.
(22) REGIONAL CENTERS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: PROSPECTS AND PROBLEMS.
Archaeologists are becoming increasingly conscious of the responsibilities of research, data
retrieval, data curation, professional training, and other areas of our discipline that have
requirements often exceeding our present institutional capacities. Today, almost without
exception, archaeological activities are organized on a one-institution basis—one university
department, one museum, or one governmental! agency. This limited organizational base has
imposed serious limits on the scale and complexity of archaeological efforts of all kinds.
Increasingly, archacologists are faced with problems whose solution is beyond our present
organizational limits. This symposium will explore ideas and approaches for developing
regional centers that have the capacity to solve problems on a higher ievel. Symposium
participants will explore possible activities that might best be organized within regional
centers. They will explore alternative strategies for organizing and funding centers. Specific
attention will be @irected to problems of support for interdisciplinary research, long-term
curation, “Marge-scale data retrieval systems, special research services, and other potential
activities that might best be organized within regional centers.
(25) ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL THEORY AND RECONSTRUCTIONS. Zooarchaeological
analysis is increasingly becoming 3 major aspect of archaeological research; and the question
arises as to whether or not there is any theory behind the analysis. While approaches vary,
basic orinciples should be the same. Reconstructions are based on Known or analogous
habitat requirements and life histories. Using several faunal groups as examples, the
symposium attemiats to Cemonstrate the possibilities and problems in reconstruction and
‘explore the theoretical Dackground, if any. :

, (31) ASCA—CURRENT ISSUES IN CONSERVATION ARCHAEOLOGY. Since its
inception in 1974, the American Society for Conservation Archaeology has sought to define
its role. Our articles of incorporation state that the goals of the society are to “promote and
coordinate scholarly activities, scientific research education, and high Quality of standards in
the pursuit of the preservation and protection of archaeological values of both the
prehistoric and historic eras... The present complement of papers express the range of
interests that may fairly be included within the conservation ethic. These papers range from
professionalism to safety, environmental law, antiquities violations, administration of
cultural resources by federal agencies and corporations, and archaeological research design
under salvage conditions. This first ASCA symposium indicates clearly that Conservation of
archaeological resources has many facets which affect the planning and execution of
archaeological endeavors on a dally basis.
(32) THE USES AND ABUSES OF VARIOUS SCIENTIFIC AIDS TO ARCHAEOLOG-
ICAL RESEARCH. Archaeology has, can, and should avail itself of the information which
can be derived from a large number of fields within the natural and physical sciences,
However, at times either archaeologists or their associates in other disciplines, or both,
misapply or misinterpret data. It is the purpose of the several papers to review what their
specialties can contribute to archaeological interpretation, what they cannot do, and how
collaboration for common goals can best be achieved. This symposium was organized and
sponsored by the Association for Field Archaeology.
(36) ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE DELAWARE INDIANS. This symposium summarizes
present archaeological knowledge of the settlement and subsistence patterns of the
proto-historic and historic Delaware, and relates this knowledge to ethnohistorical
information on their settlement-subsistence patterns from the seventeenth century up to the
early twentieth century. Thurman deals with Delaware migrations and characterizes changes
in their settlement-subsistence patterns. Kraft and Moeller report on recent excavations
clarifying Delaware origins and settlement-subsistence patterns in the Delaware Valley and
contiguous areas. Baby and Jury provide detailed reports on excavation of mission villages,
an important later settlement type, in Ohio and Ontario, Secondine provides reminiscences
of the early twentieth century Delaware Indian community of northeastern Oklahoma.
(37) CULTURAL INTERACTION IN CENTRAL MEXICO. In this symposium we examine
the evidence for cultural interaction between Teotihuacan and some neighboring regions.
There has been a significant accumulation of three kinds of information making possible an
abundance of new proposals regarding Teotihuacan trade and the interactions between
communities engaged in this exchange. The new data are from (1) surface surveys and
stratigraphic excavations at Teotihuacan itself, (2) surface surveys of the surrounding
Valley, and (3) recent excavations in Hidalgo, Pueb}a-Tlaxcala, and the Valley of Toluca.
Controlled intersite comparisons of architecture and cultural assemblages will be made. The
contemporaneity of the sites and the identification of traded items will be discussed.
(40) EXPLANATION OF PALEOLITHIC ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY. Based on
examples from Cantabrian Spain, Soutnwest France, Germany, and Central Europe, the
symposium will deal with a number of explanations for variability in the archaeological
record from the late and post-Pleistocene. Individual papers will discuss variability at the
level of sites, small areas, and entire regions of Europe. Emphasis will be placed on
functional and stylistic explanations of variability, using information from particular classes
of artifacts, as well as from whole assemblages of tools and faunal remains, and from site
locations and configurations.
(42) KINCAID SITES AND SOUNDINGS: ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH 196/7-76.
Southern (ilinois University has been actively engaged in archaeological research at the
Kincaid site for the past decade. The activities undertaken by the Field School in
Archaeology have resulted in an extremely complete picture of settlement for the area
during Mississippian times. Various aspects of the project will be discussed.
(43) COMPUTERIZED DATA MANAGEMENT IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Archaeological
activity generates vast and typically unmanagable amounts of information. From one
large-scale survey or excavation literally millions of potential observations may be made and
recorded. tn the past, archaeologists have attacked this problem through a multitude of
manual cross-filing systems and forms, if they have cared to attack it at all. With the advent
of modern electronic data processing systems, the computer has become an increasingly
important tool in the handling of the information. This symposium will explore the
rationale and techniques involved in the use of the computer to store and retrieve
archzeological information. This use of computers in archaeology is to be strictly differen-
tiatee from the statistical and numerical analysis with which the phrase ‘computers ©
archaeology’’ has been traditionally associated. Although numerical analysis is Important
its own right, this symposium will be concerned with computer techniques whecn gude te
archaeologist ta the information which he wishes to find and allow him to 2% coOmeren

, of all, decisions must be made on just what information is to be recorded, These problems,
their general significance, and applications of data management to different problems in
archaeology will be explored by the papers in this session.
(44) RECENT RESEARCH ON TEOTIHUACAN. The Teotihuacan Mapping Project
(directed by Rene Millon) collected an immense amount of data in the course of an
intensive systematic surface survey of the entire city, supplemented by problem-oriented
small excavations. This symposium reports results from a variety of analytical approaches
being applied to this data.

, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS*
Adams, E. Charies (Museum of Northern Arizona) WALPI: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF AN
HISTORIC AND LIVING COMMUNITY. Beginning in November 1975, an 18-month
restoration program for the Hopi Pueblo, Walpi, was begun. Funding for the restoration and
attendant archaeology is provided by the Economic Development Administration. The
development, implementation, and acceptance of an archaeological project within a living
Hopi Pueblo provides a unique backdrop to the project. The continuity of archaeology with
the living community allows the consideration of a large variety of hypotheses. The data
being collected should shed light on processes of material culture disintegration (how
material culture arrives at its archaeological context), culture continuity and change,
material correlates of social structure, inter- and intravillage structure, the study of modern
Hopi pottery, the evolution of architectural style, as well as many others. In general an
ethnoarchaeological model is being applied. (4)
Adams, Richard E. W. (Texas-San Antonio) THE GUERRERO PROJECT: ARCHAEOLOG-
ICAL AND ETHNOHISTORICAL STUDIES OF EIGHTEENTH CENTURY SPANISH
MISSIONS IN NORTHERN COAHUILA. The Guerrero Project of The University of
Texas at San Antonio is investigating, through the avenues of archaeology and ethnohistory,
the eighteenth century Spanish mission complex in an area of northern Coahuila formerly
known as San Juan Bautista del Rio Grande. Three missions—San Juan Bautista, San
Bernardo, and San Francisco Solano—were established in this region beginning in 1699. The
research, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities and two Texas
foundations, is providing new data on the mission system in the area, and is examining the
historic Indian occupations associated with the missions. (10)
Adovasio, James M. (Pittsburgh) MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER: RETROSPECT 1975.
All of the data currently available indicate that Meadowcroft Rockshelter was more or less
continuously utilized as a locus for hunting, collecting, and food processing from at least the
early fifteenth millennium B.C. to the historic period. As such it represents not only the
oldest well dated site in eastern North America but also one of the longest stratified
occupational sequences in the hemisphere. The culture sequence at Meadowcroft Rock-
shelter is summarized, and the character and pattern of spatial and temporal intensity of site
utilization are detailed. Summary comments are offered on the external affinities of the
sequent Meadowcroft assemblages to complexes elsewhere in the eastern United States
specifically, and North America generally. (2)
Adovasio, J. M. (see Carlisie, R.) (16)
Aikens, C. Melvin (Oregon) ASSEMBLAGE VARIATION AND ACTIVITY LOCI AT
COFFEE POT FLAT, SOUTH-CENTRAL OREGON. Coffee Pot Flat is a mountain
meadow several miles west of the vast Chewaucan Marsh of south-central Oregon at the
western edge of the Great Basin. Intensive survey coverage of the 3-1/2 square-mile area
yielded 51 activity loci of varying extent. Projectile point time markers indicate that the
meadow was occupied over the past 5,000 to 7,000 years. Detailed analysis of controlled
surface collections suggests activity variants. It is speculated that the Coffee Pot Flat
occupation represents the summertime activity patterns of transhumant populations which
wintered around the Chewaucan Marsh. (34)
Aldrich, Frank T. (Arizona State) COMPUTERIZED SURFICIAL DISPLAY AND
CLASSIFICATION EXPERIMENTS FOR LIENCRES ARTIFACTS, NORTH COASTAL
SPAIN. This paper presents the results of a series of computerized spatial and classificatory
experiments designed to test the methodological validity of employing 3-dimensional
perspective plotting and Braun-Blanquet “tabular analysis" to process surface artifactual
scatter. The data is from Liencres, an early Holocene open site near Santander, Spain.
Experiments include the production of single and multiple plots of continuous and
discontinuous artifact surfaces generated from spatially modified data. The Braun-Blanquet
methodology which was initially developed for ecological analysis was also applied to the
data. All experimental results were compared with spatial findings of Clark (1975). (19, 20)

, Teotinuacan influence across the modern state of Morelos, Mexico. This influence is
strongest and most long lasting in the eastern half of the state. Teotihuacan influence in
western Morelos is scant, restricted to the early Classic, and gave rise to the enigmatic
cultural assemblage of Xochicalco, Morelos. The material is discussed on terms of its utility
for funding research in the Central Mexican Classic. (37)
Anzalone, Ronald D. (SUNY Binghamton) QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE
STRATEGIES FOR ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS: A MEDIEVAL MOROCCAN
EXAMPLE. A medieval town site on the north coast of Morocco provides the focus for
describing and explaining settlement structure and change. Settlements are viewed as both
networks of structures and as networks of social interactions. Architectural remains, like
other artifacts, form a subsystem of patterned behavioral indicators, Spatial patterning of
architectural! units, the physical ‘‘structure’’ of the site, and technological variability within
the constructional components of Buildings are being systematically studied. By combining
Qualitative models with quantitative analysis of such architectural remains, it is possible to
make tentative statements concerning changing patterns of land use and constructional
resource utilization. (33)

Arnold, J. Barto, til (Texas) ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER-
DRAWN CONTOUR AND THREE-DIMENSIONAL PERSPECTIVE PLOTS. Topographic
contour maps have long been a basic archaeological tool. Magnetic and other remote sensing
data can be handled in a similar fashion. The computer offers a fast, efficient and relatively
inexpensive means for the production of traditional contour maps as well as shaded line
printer or electro-static plots, vertex plots, and three-dimensional perspective plots. There
are several contour plotting packages available, CPS-1 by Unjtec, SYMVU by the Harvard

Arundale, Wendy H. (Washington) A DISCUSSION OF SOME MODELS OF CLIMATIC
CHANGE FOR THE EASTERN ARCTIC. Models which use climatic change as their
independent variable have become increasingly important in eastern arctic research. In this
paper, two such models are described and data which contradicts some of their predictions
for environmental change is presented. One implication of this contradictory data is that
alternative models of the processes of demographic change are needed. One such model is
proposed. A second implication is that we need to be using a variety of explanatory models,
including models of subsistence settlement system change if we are to maximize the
productivity of arctic research. (35)

Banks, Larry (Army Corps of Engineers) THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
ACT—CO-ORDINATED. The Tulsa District of the Corps of Engineers has been involved in
archaeological contracting for the past five years, and by May 1974 had an operating staged
program with a built-in mechanism for incorporation of contracting for archaeological
mitigation. As a result, the district began such investigations in almost immediate response
to Public Law 93-291. In addition to a number of on-going preliminary archaeological
investigations, the district is administering fourteen mitigation programs developed from
earlier reconnaissance reports, It is only by these follow-up studies that the quality and legal
sufficiency of the previous reports can be fully evaluated. In most cases, considerable
deficiencies have been observed. In addition, the district has been employing all three facets
of study authorized by Public Law 93-291, which are (1) transfer of funds to the NPS, (2)
direct contracting, and (3) in-house studies. The three methods have varied degrees of
success. Based on results of case histories within the district, recommendations for
upgrading the continuity of an archaeological program as authorized by Public Law 93-291
are: (1) better administration, co-ordination, and responsiveness between contractors and
federal agencies and between federal and state agencies; (2) more critical reviews of reports
by principal investigators and the sponsoring agencies; (3) more critical reviews of budgetary
proposals; (4) a more conscious effort to explore means of mitigation other than excavation;
(5) a concerted effort to make the public aware of archaeological goals through better
communications, publicly oriented publications resulting from technical studies, and
interpretative displays. (1)
Benn, David (Luther College) NOTES ON LATE WOODLAND FABRIC IMPRESSED
POTTERY: A VIEW FROM NORTHEAST IOWA. The fabric impressions on Late
Woodland Madison Ware ceramics are investigated for their structural variations and

indicates the presence of a single fabric sheet. Other regional variations of Late Woodland
fabrics are also considered for their comparisons with Madison Ware. (16)
Bennett, Victoria C. (UCLA) MICROPROBE ANALYSIS AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF

REGIONAL SAMPLING DESIGN: CEDAR MESA, UTAH. The results of a block survey
recently conducted in the Qwi Creek drainage of eastern Cedar Mesa, Utatr, are used to test
the adequacy and predictive power of the quadrat survey designed by W. D. Lipe and R. G.
Matson and undertaken in 1972-75. Several of the Cedar Mesa Project predictions
concerning differential site densities are replicated in the block survey data, while other
results indicate substantial departures from those obtained by the quadrat sampling method.
The initial assumptions of the Cedar Mesa regional sampling design are examined, and the
design held to be inadequate for predicting the degree of variability within the site
population of Cedar Mesa. Although the reliability and precision of the quadrat samples are
good, their relationship to the sampled universe is questioned. (4)

Bettinger, Robert L. (New York) ALTERNATIVE SETTLEMENT-SUBSISTENCE
STRATEGIES IN THE GREAT BASIN. It has been generally held that the indigenous
prehistoric cultures of the Great Basin were uniformly marked by eclectic subsistence
patterns, impermanent settlements, and rudimentary forms of social and political
organization. A growing body of archaeological evidence from a variety of localities,
however, presents a far more complex picture. tn addition to the traditionally recognized
settiement-subsistence patterns, it is mow clear that in some areas highly specialized
subsistence patterns were linked with large, permanent settlements, and surprisingly
complex social and political forms. As previously suspected, the diversity in subsistence-
settlement patterns is related to regional and temporal resource variations, but demographic
factors have exerted a major influence on these patterns as well. (7)

EXAMPLE FROM FORT PELHAM. Faunal materials from Fort Pelham, a mid-eighteenth
century fort located in northern Massachusetts, will be used to examine English foodways as
manifested in military communities. Dietary patterns will be established first by placing the
heavy reliance on domestic foodstuffs evidenced in the Ft. Pelham faunal material in
context with English foodway patterns, and then comparing this data with faunal reports ;
from other eighteenth century British forts. This comparison, which shows a similar reliance
on domestic animals, also demonstrates a considerable variation in the proportions of the
domestic animals used in different communities. A number of variables will be examined to
suggest that these differences are in part the result of differences in local resources and the
logistics of their supply system. Documentary data from Ft. Pelham will be used in 7
conjunction with data from the faunal material to demonstrate that with the combination
of local resources and a reliance on their supply system, dietary patterns within this military
community were essentially English in character, but varied in ways compelled by their
living situation. (5)

FOREST, U.S. FOREST SERVICE, CALIFORNIA REGION, After nearly two years of
effort toward implementation of federal cultural resource management guidelines the U.S.
Forest Service, Modoc Nationa! Forest, has begun to direct its archaeological inventory
program into one which is approaching the concept of conservation archaeology.
Conservation archaeology is viewed in this paper as something more than asystematic,
project-oriented site recordation and evaluation. This dichotomy between conservation and
asystematic recordation is discussed, utilizing examples of such work done upon the Forest.
In conclusion, recommendations toward needed directions to incorporate cultural resource
management into the National Forest Multiple-Use Planning process will be made. (31) .

EXPERIMENT WITH A CENTRAL ARIZONA ARCHAEOLOGICAL COLLECTION.
Pottery from a Museum of Northern Arizona contract project were examined in an
experimental vessel form study designed to permit interpretation of site vessel assemblages
in terms of the ranges of domestic activities which might have produced them. The
experiment employed a general model for the relationship between vessel form and use,
derived from data on céramic vessel use among Southwestern ethnohistoric groups, which
emphasizes the importance of vessel orifice size and shape in determining use patterns.
initial analysis of archaeological rim sherd formal attributes prescribed by the general model
led to the definition of six cross-cultural shape classes and seven size classes, yielding a
classification paradigm of 42 idealized vessel form classes, the difference between which
could be Gijrectly interpreted in terms of differences in associated patterns of use. The
development and testing of the classification framework are discussed, and the result of its
application to an archaeological data set are presented. (11)

HUMAN DIET. Bone strontium can be used to determine the relative proportions of animal
and vegetable matter in the diet by comparing human bone strontium levels with those of
known faunal remains from the same site. Changes in the diet through time will be reflected
in changes in bone strontium in successive skeletal populations. At the Farukhabad site in
iran the human bone strontium level in relation to that of a domesticated herbivore from
the same site remains stable through time. This suggests little change in the proportions of
dietary components. Changes in access to resources due to social structure will also be
reflected In bone strontium content. From the Huitzo site in the Valley of Oaxaca, the
Gevelopment of social classes can be traced by the increase in bone strontium variation
within the population and the disparities between the upper, middie, and lower segments of
the population. (5)
Brown, Betty Ann (iilinois State) EARLY COLONIAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE .
MEXICA MONTHLY CALENDAR. Several Early Colonial manuscripts from the Valley of
Mexico region contain illustrated descriptions of Mexica calendrics. Often, two calendrical
systems are described: the tonalpohualli and the monthly calendar. The monthly calendar is
composed of 18 20-day ‘“‘months"’ and five nameless days, thus totaling 365 days. The
months are often described in the Early Colonial manuscripts as ceremonial periods each |
with a patron deity or deities. There are no pre-Conquest representations of the Mexica ;
months per se nor are there pre-Conquest glyphic notations of the monthly periods from the ;
Valley of Mexico. The post-Conquest descriptions and illustrations of the months vary
greatly, as do the post-Conquest glyphic symbols for the months. Analysis of the Early
Colonial descriptions and illustrations of one month, Tlacaxipehualiztli, demonstrates the
marked inconsistencies in the post-Conquest representations of the monthly calendar.
Moreover, it is found that both the pictorial and textual content of the Early Colonial
descriptions contain paratiels with the European caiendrical tradition. It is suggested that
the Spaniards who wrote the Early Colonial descriptions of the months manipulated the
data they received from the Mexica in order to produce a calendrical system that met their
own cultural expectations and was therefore comprehensible to them. (26, 27)

changes at a site in terms of climatic and environmental changes. However, vegetational
changes can be brought about by land, environmental, or plant modifications carried out by

in terms of distinctive artifact and burial styles, subsistence strategy, and social organization.
it is frequently assumed that interface periods of social-cultural transformation reflect times

unsatisfactory explanation of intra-regional epigenetic variability in temporally sequential

Burtchard, Grea C. (New Mexico) POPULATION PATTERNING: AN ARCHAEOLOG|}-

Canyon, New Mexico, suggests that changes in settlement pattern are determined by changes
in regional subsistence resource availability. In this study, a sequence of population
aggregation, site abandonment, and rehabitation jis discussed. The sequence is related to
nutritional factors such as availability of high-quality protein resources and dietary
consequences of minor environmental changes. The data necessary to examine this
relationship require a regional perspective utilizing both site survey and intensive excavation.
This body of data should include relative size of population units and temporal sequence of
the units. It must also include floral and faunal resources exploited during habitation and
immediately prior to site abandonment. Techniques used to recover these data are discussed
as well as methods of quantitative analysis. This study stresses the importance of considering
nutritional factors relevant to the archaeological investigation of population patterning. (5)

27
, Salmon 1975; Watson et al. 1971, 1974) are premature and obscure the far more
fundamental differences between ongoing archaeological practice and the ideals of natural
science. Association of the new archaeology with logical positivism is mistaken because
natural science represents the fundamental revolution in method engendered by Galileo,
Francis Bacon, and their colleagues rather than just the much more circumscribed dicta of
the “‘Vienna Circle."’ Most archaeological method in use today still reflects the pre-Galilean
position of Aristotelian logic as the way to knowledge. The transition from Aristotelian to
Galilean reasoning must be understood and completed before debates over the merits of
alternate models of Galilean explanations are particularly fruitful. (39)
Chatters, James C. (Washington) THE LONGITUDINAL LAND USE STUDY: A METHOD
FOR THE INVESTIGATION OF CULTURE-ENVIRONMENT RELATIONSHIPS. The
relationship between cultural and environmental change is seldom treated by archaeologists
in a sophisticated manner; that is, if cultural change is perceived to have occurred, the
hypothesis that an environmental event is responsible is often deemed sufficient if the latter
merely correlates with the cultural event. Whether such hypotheses are of the linear form or
are stated in systems theoretic terms, causal links between the environmental and cultural
events are seldom demonstrated, nor are alternative hypotheses considered. A method is
presented which has been designed to improve this situation for the archaeological study of
land use. The longitudinal tand use study method advances a series of alternative conceptual
models against which archaeological, paleontological, palynological, and paleoclimatological
data may be compared. When data have been collected within the constraints of the
method, this comparison constitutes a test of several alternative hypotheses in a single step, :
without extensive prior knowledge of a study region. Results of the application of this
method in the Pahsimeroi Valley of central tdaho are discussed and prospects for more
extensive use of the method are considered. (41)

are defined by context only; no objective, non-contextual measures exist. To provide such
measures, test expectations are abstracted from Schiffer’s definitions and applied to
context-defined refuse from rooms and plazas. This methodological exercise aims at
generating a model for objectively evaluating the status of any given refuse type. At
Grasshopper, this can aid in interpreting the source and types of activities; more broadly,
the model should be applicable to most southwestern pueblo sites. (4)

CHANGE. The biological impact of changes in subsistence base strategies of exploitation, ;

Disturbances of growth in individuals dying between one and four years are a particularly
sensitive index, in that these deaths generally reflect nutritionally mediated disease in
modern primitive groups. A model for these effects is tested using Woodland and
Mississippian skeletal material from the lower Illinois Valley region. Evidence for growth
arrest, growth retardation, enamel defects, and interactions with nutritionally mediated
diseases suggest higher biological costs in the terminal Late Woodland populations of the
region. (6) :

, Croes, Dale R. (Washington State) OZETTE BASKETRY, MATTING, AND CORDAGE.
Ozette basketry and cordage artifacts have been examined on three analytic levels. First,
Ozette basketry and cordage attributes, including construction materials, construction
techniques, forms, and sizes, have been analyzed and defined. Second, the results of the
attribute (mode) analyses have been synthesized into paradigmatic classifications creating
technical/stylistic classes of Ozette baskets, mats, hats, and cordage. And third, these
technical/stylistic classes Nave been utilized in discussing functional categories of Ozette
basketry and cordage as recovered and examined in the Ozette House ! context. Computer
mapping procedures have been used to trace basketry and cordage items of specific
functional categories throughout the House ! area. Utilizing the Ozette analysis as a focus,
prehistoric basketry and cordage from ten other Northwest Coast water-saturated
archaeological sites have been similarly examined. Comparisons of the Ozette and other
prehistoric Northwest Coast basketry and cordage on the three analytical levels provided
information concerning the development of basketry and cordage technologies on the
Narthwest Coast for the tast 3,000 years. These comparisons have provided valuable new
information about the development of, and relationships between, different Northwest
Coast cultural manifestations through time and space. Examining this kind of material also
provided explicit information concerning the activities taking place at different Northwest
Coast wet sites. From the above accumulated information jt is clear that basketry, in
particular, and cordage to some degree will be important analytic artifact categories for
establishing sensitive chronologies on the Northwest Coast and for deriving essential
information for testing hypothetical cultural interrelationships on the Northwest Coast
through time and space. (30)

more, faunal analysis provides hard evidence of food preparation and consumption and fills
in many details of daily life not touched on jin the historical records, details necessary for

Cushman, Kathleen A. (Texas A&M) SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF AN AURIGNACIAN
OCCUPATION FLOOR AT CUEVA MORIN, SPAIN. The Early Aurignacian complex at
Cueva Morin, inctuding burials and the remnants of a structure, offers a unique opportunity
to examine the spatial organization of Early Upper Paleolithic occupants at this Cantabrian
cave. From the analysis of spatial utilization on the occupation floor at Cueva Morin direct
evidence can be obtained for the association of particular tool types with specific areas on
the floor. The association of particular tools with particular areas is evidently not to be
attributed to stylistic influences, but rather to the specific functions for which these tools
were intended, Instead of treating particular tool types as products of special identity-
conscious groups, it would obviously seem to be more valid to view particular tool types on
single living floors as functionally-specific rather than as culturally specific items. (40)
Cyphers, Ann FORMATIVE CERAMIC HORIZON STYLES: DEFINITION AND
SIGNIFICANCE. Styles in prehispanic ceramics which cover broad geographical areas, called
horizon styles, define culture areas. Horizon styles in ceramics indicate a cognitive unity on
the part of the makers of the ceramics which can be inferred to a cognitive and cultural
unity of the part of the users of those ceramics. Recent research at Chalcatzingo, Morelos,
indicates the possibility that there are four ceramic horizon styles definable for the Early
and Middia Formative periods. The importance of these early horizon styles in Mesoamerica
is that they indicate large, culturally unified areas having !ong-distance contacts at a very
early date. The wide geographical extent of certain ceramic styles indicates the extent of the
expansion of West Mexican culture into the highlands, the paths of interaction of the Gulf
Coast Olmec with the highltandeérs, and the development of complex interregional exchange
and communication networks. (23)

Davis, Dave D. (Brandeis) MIDDLE FORMATIVE COASTAL ADAPTATIONS AND
INTER-REGIONAL CONTACTS IN SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA. Middle Formative
occupations along the Pacific coast of southern Mesoamerica are marked by changes in
subsistence emphases as well as in cultural material. Although relatively few occupations of
earlier Middie Formative age are as yet Known from the coastal region, the available .
evidence is sufficient to indicate that this period, in comparison to the Early Formative, was
marked by greater influences from interior Chiapas and the adjacent isthmian region. The
nature of interaction between the coast and interior is discussed. While the early Middle
Formative did not mark major changes in the patterns of Pacific coastal life, increased |
contact with the interior expanded and strengthened coastal subsistence patterns. A greater
reliance on maize cultivation is also indicated for Middle Formative times. (14)
Davis, Emma Lou (Natural History Museum of L.A. County) LATE POPULATION SHIFTS
FROM THE GREAT BASIN-GREAT PLAINS: A HYPOTHESIS. For the past decade, a
hypothesis of a Clovis Conquest of the New World has stood uncontested. This paper
presents an alternative set of cultural events with a proposed time depth of 40,000 years or
more in the Great Basin “‘Lakes Country.” Based on broad spectra of Upper Paleolithic sites
with associated animal and lithic remains at China Lake, we propose the Lakes Country as
one of the New Worid cultural hearths. There appear to have been Late Wisconsin .
migrations from there into the emerging Great Plains. In our hypothesis smafi bands of
PaleoSiberians with maritime cultures and water craft had been drifting into North America
for 50,000 years. By 35,000 years ago, the Lakes Country was thinly populated by
culturally diverse bands of foragers who also bagged an occasional camel, Dison, horse, or .
mammoth. They used implements stemming from Core Tool tradition technologies of
Northeast Asian origins. During much of the Late Wisconsin stadials, the Lakes Country Was
cold steppe with some xeric woodland, while territory east of the Rockies was less
productive. it was boreal forest, parkland, sand and tundra. Therefore the Lakes Country :
and California coasts were preferred habitats and migration routes for humans and the i
Pleistocene megafauna alike. in the basin of Pleistocene Lake China, two lithic traditions
contributed to late evolution of Proto-Clovis and then Classic Clovis butchering tools. After
12,000 years B.P. recent desiccation cycles of the lakes began while at the same time, a
northward retreat of forests opened the emergent Great Plains to advancing grasslands. The
combination produced an eastward flow of Clovis Hunter-foragers and the tast of the
megafaunal grazers. This hypothesis accounts for the late appearance and brief duration of
Clovis hunting patterns east of the Rockies. (34)
Davis, Hester A. (Arkansas Archeological Survey) REAUTHORIZATION OF PL 93-291. It
was the stipulation of the Congress that five years from passage, PL 93-291 was to be
reviewed and reauthorized. There had been questions concerning its workability in several
areas and the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs felt the need for a review of how
and whether the bill was really doing what it was supposed to do. This review will
presumably take place in 1978, two years from now, for reauthorization in 1979. The
National Park Service is required to report to Congress each year on activities under this
legislation, and will, naturally, have major comment at the time of the 1978 hearings. It is
the purpose of this paper to summarize the areas of concern and inquiry which can be
expected from the Interior Committee, and for which archaeologists must start gathering
data now, (1)
Davis, Hester A. (Arkansas) REGIONAL PLANNING AND STATE ARCHAEOLOGICAL
PROGRAMS. Only in rare cases have archaeologists been able to look beyond a single
research problem or a specific geographic area. Recentiy, there has been a healthy trend
toward state archaeological councils in order that some semblance of order might be
maintained |n the light of increased field activity. Federal agencies generally begin planning
on a regional basis. If archaeologists are to maximize the recovery and/or protection of
cultural resources, we, too, must expand our view and our planning process. Cooperative
planning for research on a regional basis will provide direction to state or inter-state research
projects. Regional centers should be able to provide state archaeological programs with the
kind of overview facilities and information necessary for realistic resource management.
States generally cannot themselves support the necessary basic coordination of records and
material. A combination of public, state, and federal support will mean a greater ability to
conserve our cultural heritage. (22)

, DeGarmo, Glen D. (California) SYSTEMATICS OF PREHISTORIC POTTERY ANALYSIS.
Some of the different systematics used for the classification of prehistoric pottery are
discussed. It is argued that these systematics often cause attributes that are not understood
to be arbitrarily selected for inclusion as part of the definitional criteria for the resulting
pottery types. Thus, these types probably do not represent prehistoric sociocultural
phenomena. An alternative approach to pottery systematics is suggested. Data excavated
from a P-II! pueblo are used to illustrate the discussion. (11)
DePratter, Chester B. (Georgia) AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF A PORTION OF

produced a large number of sites located on remnant beach ridges, remnant spits, or modern
accretional barrier Isiands. Since the entire survey area was known to be of recent
(Holocene) origin, distribution of sites during the various occupational phases was studied in
an attempt to understand the paleoecology of the area. Patterning of site distribution
indicates that rates of shoreline progradation, variations of shoreline orientation, and
variation in aboriginal settlement can be determined through the study of archaeological site
distribution in this area. (28)

One major objective of the Hinds Cave excavations was to recover a stratified sequence of

problem was to determine a systematic (yet statistically accurate) system of sampling these 7

Donahue, J. (Pittsburgh) GEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK OF MEADOWCROFT ROCK-
SHELTER. Meadowcroft Rockshelter is located beneath a cliff of Morgantown-Connellsville
sandstone (Pennsylvanian) on the north bank of Cross Creek, a small tributary of the Onio

River. The rockshelter formed during Pleistocene downcutting of the Cross Creek drainage.
Sediments beneath the rockshelter have two sources. Sand and coarser blocks are derived by
attrition from the sandstone cliff. Sediment falling from the cliff is being collected in a
systematic fashion to determine present sedimentation rates from this source. Claysized
material is transported by sheet wash from the upland surface. The colluviail fill at this site

has not been disturbed since deposition except for man's activities. Grain size analysis as

well as oxygen isotope data suggest a warming climate since 14,000 8.C. Chemical analysis

for potassium, Magnesium, caicium, phosphorus, and nitrogen give some information on the

spatial and temporal intensity of site utilization within the sediment column, A detailed
petrographic examination of the sandstone cliff is being carried out. This will allow
determination of the evolution of the rockshelter through the 16,000 year occupational
sequence. During early phases of Occupation, the Wisconsin glacial boundary was less than

150 km, to the north. After 13,000 B.C., the glacial boundary retreated northward. (2)

Dougherty, Bernardo (Smithsonian) AN EARLY POTTERY COMPLEX IN THE WESTERN
FOREST REGION, NORTHWEST ARGENTINA. This paper deals with an ancient pottery
complex ($750 6.C.-A.D. 300) which spread throughout the northern part of the forest
region of Northwest Argentina, and which clearly relates to later cultures developed as far as
Mendoza Province. It is claimed that there are at least two different routes for the spread of

what is currently labeled “Amazonian” or “Tropical Forest" influences in the development

of pottery entities in Northwest Argentina; one is the Chaco Area and the other the San
Francisco Valley Region, which is the main subject of this research. Some time around 750

B.C. the valley was occupied by semisedentary groups which lived in the piedmont forests

and near the river basins, avoiding the hill siopes. Some sites are evidenced by habitation
mounds, while others appear as circular areas from 300 to 1,500 m. in diameter amidst the

forest. Materials recovered are mostly ceramics and very few burials have been found; bones,
human and nonhuman, are poorly preserved. Pottery clusters in two main groups, one
polished and the other unpolished. The former consists of shallow, flat-bottomed bowls and |
small rounded ollas, together with funerary oval urns with modeled adornos and tugs, while

the latter consists of large oval ollas with big vertical handles, Vessels of both groups exhibit ;
thickened lips, a trait rare elsewhere on the Argentine Northwest. Decoration on polished ;
surfaces is by red-on-buff painting, or incision filled with red pigment, or zoned red-on-buff.
Motifs are geometric and rectilinear. The unpolished surfaces may have corrugation on the
exterior, or the necks may bear incised chevrons or finger groovings. This complex appears

to have spread mainiy West and Southward, following the forest environment. Few traces

have been found in the dryer Quebrada de Humahuaca and Chaco areas. A well established

trade with the highlands is indicated by obsidian points and copper rings, which are not of

local origin or manufacture. Some of the pottery decorative traits resermbie those of the
Chiripa culture on the Bolivian Plateau. (18)

selected, unusual natural features of the landscape in which they found themselves (notches

dates in the solar calendar to locate the monuments. Only a combination of astronomy and
natural topographic alignments yields a solution. Neither alone is sufficient. (44) .

Eowerds, Wiliam ©. (U_S. tmtermational University) THE ORIGIN OF CITIES. Towns and
| Cities seem Gest Gefine=s Oy Groportionste specialization. Towns did not originate from '
Nhomogencsous wleess Dy the clustering of landless, Nungry farmers seeking employment, or
through potentia§ erman eftcsency. Gueite Universally interpreted is that farming finally
improved to prodwce 2 surplus, spontaneously Channefed to urban specialists for needed
goods and services. This = fallacious and invalid. Population growth generally presses the
subsistence ceiling excessively (Matthus 1798). Where otherwise primitive farmers tend to
expend surplus productivity mot On extrarura! goods but on additional food consumption
and lieisure time, per capita potential food productivity soon declines as population
increases. Thus there is only an extremely fow correlation between an area's potential
technological and domesticate productivity and the presence and extent of early
urbanization (Southeast Asia, Russia, Mesoamerica). interpreting the origin of cities simply
requires identifying the persuasive-coerciye mechanisms, singly or in combination, for
extracting nonexistant “‘surplus”’ from hungry tearmers. (1) Especialiv in recently settled
34
, areas with remaining potential surplus, farmers may be persuaded or, more reliably, coerced
(Japan, 1603-1868) to exchange work and food for superior farming equipment or useful,
attractive, prestigious luxury (soon ‘‘necessity'’) manufactures of part-time village craftsmen
transformed to full-time town specialists. (2) Hungry farmers may be persuaded to
contribute nonsurplus food to priests specialized in interceding with the supernatural,
thereby establishing ceremonial centers which expand to true towns and cities as political,
military, and economic functions are added (Sumer, Southeast Asia, La Venta to Mayapan).
(3) Political integration and specialists may ensue from the need for organization to
construct fortifications or irrigation systems or from cultural selection advantages of
voluntary (rare) or conquest states, with tribute and taxes to the capital town.
Governmental! coercion has constituted the primary factor in the origin of cities. Taxes, not
“surplus” or farmers’ needs, enabled a few pre-industrial cities (Rome, Tokyo) to achieve
populations of 1,000,000. (39)

association with Desert Culture split twig figurines in order to determine the cultural
affinities of the latter. (2) To obtain a stratigraphic biological record from the cave deposits
to reconstruct a paleo-environmental sequence in Grand Canyon, While 65 figurines were
recovered, all from the upper five centimeters, no other artifacts were found in association.
The author’s earlier postulate that the twig figures were associated with the Pinto Basin
culture remains hypothetical. The biological remains recovered yielded important data
which, when placed in relationship to the radiocarbon dates obtained, extend back more
than 35,000 years. In lower tevels, Pleistocene birds and animals were found in association
with dominant Artemesia and Juniperus, indicating a cooler, more moist climate than exists

climate. (29)

initiated in the proposed Meramec Park Lake in east-central Missouri. The goals for the
initial phase reflect both the needs of the Corps of Engineers and the archaeological
community and will require the application of non-traditional survey techniques. In order to
ensure the utility and applicability of data to 4 regional réseéarch universe, an interdis-
ciplinary research and resource group has been loosely organized. it is anticipated that the
Meramec project will produce data on at least five levels of utility: (1) Corps of Engineers
requirements, (2) intra-Basin requirements, (3) inter-basin requirements within Missouri, (4)
inter-Dasin requirements within the region, and (5) non-archaeological requirements. (49)

Farnsworth, Kenneth B. (Northwestern) IDEAS ON ARCHAEOLOGICAL CURATION
AND ITS ROLE IN REGIONAL CENTERS. Although proper curation of archaeological
data is an integral part of archaeological! research, researchers have given little attention to
this problem. The archaeologist’s respansibilites for curation have increased dramatically in
the past decade as a direct consequence of the growth of contract archaeology. This has
aggravated the already acute problem of curating all forms of archaeological field and
laboratory data. The Northwestern Archeological Program has begun to explore various
aspects of the problem, ranging from a study of the kinds of facilities required to the
definition of specific curatorial roles. This paper will explore the Northwestern experience,
and suggest ways in which curation might be integrated into the total concept of a ‘‘regional
center.”* (22)
Farrand, William R. (Michigan) SEDIMENTOLOGY OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. All
Stratified sites consist of sediments, which are a combination of natural deposits and
products of human activities. They form the physical framework in which artifacts and
bones occur. Although the artifacts or fossils may be absent in a given layer, the sediments :
are always present and provide the greatest possible continuity of record in the site.
Sediment study has two aspects: (a) accumulation of original sediments (processes, sources);
and (6b) subsequent modification of those sediments (weathering, mineralization, etc.).
These studies jead to inferences concerning the physical environment during and between 4
habitations and, under favorable conditions, the paleoclimate that prevailed. (32)
Feder, Kenneth L. (Connecticut) THE GEOGRAPHIC PATTERNING OF TOOL TYPES
AS ELICITED BY TREND-SURFACE ANALYSIS. The use of trend-surface analysis, a least
sQuares regression technique, is suggested for the graphic presentation and analysis of the
geographic patterning of tool types at the Anangula biade site on Anangula isiand in the
Aleutians. Trend-surface analysis provides the archaeologist with an avenue of approach
wherein contour maps are produced by the computer treating number of artifacts of each
type recovered from each X,Y coordinate as the Z or relief value. A series of these maps
aids tremendously in analyzing the mix of activity which occurred at the site. Further,
synthesizing the data from these individual maps can furnish information pertinent to the
reconstruction of tool kits and activity areas, (33)

Smithsonian is described as a possibje model for regional centers. Although the Smithsonian
is Gesignated as the U.S. National Museum, its role in public archaeology at the national
level Nas been largely advisory, and is limited to management of the River Basin Survey and

Fowler, Meivin L. (Wisconsin-Milwaukee) THE PUEBLA PRECLASSIC PROJECT: SITE
SURVEY METHODOLOGY AND SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS. The Puebla Preclassic
Project was designed to examine the change in settiement systems in the late Preclassic as an
attempt to determine the nature of sociopolitical organization before full urban centers
developed. An intensive site survey was Conducted of an area of approximately 150 square
kilometers just east of the city of Puebla. Controlled surface collections were made of over
one hundred sites. Detailed topographic maps were made of eight large sites in the region.
Some small excavations were conducted in four of the larger sites. All ceramic materials
recovered are being coded and the data stored on tape. Various statistical and mapping
programs can be run from these data. Tentative resuits from examining some of these data
indicate that the trend in settlement size and location during late Preclassic into early Classic
was one of reduction of settlement numbers and nucleation of population into fewer and
larger sites. (23)

Four Late Postclassic highland Guatemalan sites (Utatlan, Iximche, Zaculeu, and
Chuitinamit-Atitian), the largest settlements in the highlands at the time of the Spanish
Conquest, are clearly urban in nature. Their growth can be seen as a result of the centralistic
tendencies of militaristic based archaic states, typical of the Late Postclassic period in
Mesoamerica, rather than often cited environmental criteria (e.9., aridity-irrigation,
navigable watercourses, land conscription). (12)

which were occupied by the Makah in their yearly cycle. This study has been an attempt,
based upon test excavations to establish a model for camp versus village occupation, to
Getermine the season of occupation and resource utilization, and to see if differences noted
in the ethnographic literature can be documented from archaeological data. Major emonasis
has been placed on the analysis of faunal material, including mammals, birds, fish, anc

ASSEMBLAGES. This paper discusses the analysis of several thousand antler and bone
artifacts from 27 sites (differentially represented) bearing Magdalenian deposits that occur
today within the two Spanish Cantabrian provinces of Santander and Asturias. in the course
of a study attempting to elucidate the design structure of the engravings on some of these
artifacts, Questions were asked concerning the correlation of certain design structural
Principles, design elements, and design motifs with certain ‘‘types’’ or shapes. It was
predicted that if certain “‘designs’’ were different for different ‘“‘types"’ or shapes, then
where assemblages differ in typological composition, the design variability among such
assemblages should reflect the differences and/or similarities of assemblage composition.
Unfortunately, the extremely fragile and fragmentary nature of bone and antier artifacts :
impedes the identification of most pieces according to the idealized bone typologies
currently available. There wil) be discussion of new directions toward workable bone-antler
typology, and the results of the correlation analysis among ‘'types'' and design features will
be presented. Hypotheses concerning functional sources of yariability among Paleolithic
assemblages will be tested. (40) :
Fréhiich, Bruno (Connecticut) ALEUT SITE SURVEY: ADAK ISLAND AND ATTU
ISLAND. A site survey conducted in 1975 on Adak island and Attu Island in the Aleutian
Chain found 39 definite sites and 32 possible sites. Definite sites are defined as those
yielding occupational material along with clear house structure depressions. |n order to land
and make testpits the survey was carried out by using a 16 ft. inflatable boat. Enough
supplies and equipment to sustain a two man team for 60 days were carried. Aleut
settlements were located in areas having good shore landings, and traces of continuous water
sources. By observing from the sea the presence of rich green yegetation on shore, initial
identification was made in most cases. However, since thick vegetation may also be due to
surface ground water, a location was not recorded as a site Unless housepits were also
observed. Testpits were made in 38 of the 39 definite sites. Testpits measuring
approximately 100 x 100 x 75 cm., yielded occupational material in most cases. Testpits
and ground surveys were also carried out in some areas previously recorded as sites by earlier
investigators which failed to give evidence of human occupation. Our survey included the
size, altitude, geographical pasition, and local geographical, geological, and biological
phenomena in addition to extensive black/white and color photography. The testpits
yielded approximately 250 artifacts, 25 carbon samples, and several samples of faunal
remains from midden material. All samples are currently under investigation at the
Laboratory of Biological Anthropology. The survey was sponsored by the Aleut
Corporation in Anchorage where some of the data has been used in the Native Land Claim
Act. (35)

Gibbon, Guy (Minnesota) MIDDLE-LATE WOODLAND TRANSITION IN EASTERN
MINNESOTA. The paper summarizes the available data from archaeological sites dated to
the general late Middle Woodland and early Late Woodland time span in eastern Minnesota.
Data from Howard Lake, Maimo, and Sorg Middle Woodland phases are presented and
contrasted with data from sites such as Altern and Stumme in the early Late Woodland St.
Croix phase. A co-variation of environmental zones and cultural patterns has been
previously suggested for the Middie Woodland period in eastern Minnesota. These studies
have indicated that: (1) the Carolinian zone was inhabitated primarily by cultural complexes
peripheral to but integrated into the Havana-Hopewell cultural tradition, and that (2)
Carolinian-Canadian zone complexes were more diverse, less integrated as a cultural group,
and much less active participants in the Havana-Hopewell logistics system. In contrast, St.
Croix archaeological material transcends environmental zones, even extending into the
prairie zone in the southwestern corner of the state. Several alternative predictive models are
generated that attempt to explain this transition in settlement patterning and are
integration. (9)
Gilbert, Robert |., Jr. (South Florida) PALEONUTRITIONAL INSIGHTS DERIVED
FROM SKELETAL TRACE ELEMENT PATTERNING. It is Known that some trace
elements are incorporated into bone matrix and vary to some extent by the amount
available from dietary intake sources. The presence of certain trace elements in skeletal
samples may reflect concentrations of these elements as derived from three groups of
foodstuffs (animal protein, vegetative matter, and nuts). Some archaeological and
paleopathological evidence suggests that maize agriculture may have become a substantial
food producing activity of the Middle Mississippian inhabitants of the Dickson Mounds in
southeastern Illinois in contrast to the hunting and gathering (Primary Forest Efficiency)
subsistence pursued by their Late Woodland predecessors. If such a dietary alteration had
occurred, then it should be apparent in differential concentrations of trace elements in the
skeletal remains. The patterning of five trace elements (Zn, Cu, Sr, Mg, and Mn) wes stucied
in tiblataamoles taken from the two culture horizons. |t was found that Zn and Mg offered
the best @iscrimination Detween the two groups and stronaly suggests that the presemedc
adoption of maize (or certainly a decline in animal protein consumption) hac occurred. Tre

Gleason, Paul F. (Washington State) OZETTE WOODWORKING TECHNOLOGY. The
Ozette site with its remarkable preservation of wood materials provides a Startling insight
into the relative importance of wooden artifacts on the Northwest Coast. For the first time, }
it is possible to study Northwest Coast woodworking technology on the basis of
woodworking tools, detritus, preforms, and complete artifacts, all from the same time and
place. The Ozette collections reflect a well developed woodworking technology. Stone
mauls and a large number of various styles of wedges indicate that the Ozettes were j
gathering locally much of the needed raw material. The large woodworking tools, the
straight adze and the D adze, are typical of the southern outer coast area. The large amount
of fine detritus and smali preforms indicate that completion of larger artifacts and the
manufacture of smaller artifacts was done extensively within the house and appears to
reflect various manufacture loci, The large amount of woodworking information gathered
from Ozette has necessitated the development of a nomenclature for Northwest Coast
woodworking technology. (30)
Goff, Linda (Washington-St. Louis) THE JEWEL PERSONAL NAME IN THE MIXTEC
MANUSCRIPTS. This paper will present a general overview and descriptive stylistic analysis
of the jewel personal name as it appears in the pre-Conquest Mixtec screenfolds. The jewel
motif is one of the most commonly represented motifs in the manuscripts by appearing in
association with 173 different personages, and is predominately a fernale name. Analyses of
the manuscripts indicate one main stylistic category of the jewel motif with two substyles:
the full disc and its variation in the half disc and tassie motifs. This stylistic representation
furthermore reflects stylistic and thematic continuity throughout the manuscript histories.
The subject of jewel personal names has potential for more detailed analyses and the
significance of the jewel motif not only within the Mixtec manuscripts but also the social
and kinship systems. (26, 27)
Goldstein, Lynne (Wisconsin-Mitwaukee) CEMETERIES AND CORPORATE GROUPS:
SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN RURAL MISSISSIPPIAN SOCIETY. Using lower IIlinois Valley
mortuary sites, a model for non-urban Mississippian society is generated. Outlying
Mississippian mortuary sites are seen to reflect a generally egalitarian form of social
organization with a communal rather than an individualized emphasis. This communal
emphasis derives from the spatial organization of the site which, it is argued, reflects descent
of corporate groups who contro! crucial but restricted resources. Given the nature of these
specific rural communities, it is further suggested that Mississippian mortuary sites in general
represent the operation of a similar set of organizational principles based on the corporate
group premise, and are merely further elaborations on this structural base. (6)
Gonzalez Echegaray, R. P. J. (Santander Museum) THE CONCEPT OF “FACIES"
APPLIED TO THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC. Thanks principally to F. Bordes, a series of
“Facies have been defined relative to the material culture of the Middle Paleolithic. The
Mousterian does not so much present a vertical subdivision of chronological nature, as a
horizontal subdivision of cultural nature. Interpretations vary, and the so-called ‘“‘American
School” seeks environmental and functional explanations for the different facies.
Nevertheless, the Upper Paleolithic so far presents a vertical structure of chronological
nature. it seems clear that the Magdalenian is not a facies of the Aurignacian, for example. ;
However, within the Surignacian sphere, some of the different techniques recognized, tike a
Perigordian, classic Aurignacian, amc Correzian, which have recently been found mutually
interstratifiec in several sites, might also be interpreted neither as periods nor as cultures,
| but rather as facies with environmental anc functional connotations. (40) ]

Grabert, G. F. (Western Washington State) CENTRAL NORTHWESTERN COAST
PREHISTORY REVISITED: AN APPRAISAL. Archaeological studies of western Washing-
ton, including here the Fraser Delta region and the Straits of Georgia, have produced a
sound culture sequence for the last 3,000-4 ,000 years in the latter two areas. While there are
numerous sites and components that seem to precede this sequence, all but a few are poorly
dated, and represented by sparse, unimpressive artifact assemblages. There have been few
problem-oriented approaches. Yet the latter are significant to problems concerning the
adaptive strategies and cultural developments of the predecessors of the climax cultures of
the Northwest Coast. There have been few attempts to work out a post-glacial climatic
sequence for the region, and these few have been limited in geographic scape. Problems that
might profitably be explored include the nature, duration, and subsistence features of the
Olcott complex, distribution and environmental correlates of flake and cobble tool
assemblages in the region, and the role of sea level changes and forest successions in the
maritime adaptation that characterizes the Northwest Coast cultures. There are other sorts
of problems as well, Results of current ‘.,vestigations suggest that there is intensive
mid-Holocene use of the Pacific slope region and that local cultural variants are explainable
as-Pparts of a larger pattern. it is further suggested that while an Old Cordilleran Culture
concept may be applied, it can be no more than a generalized framework, unreflective of the
dynamics of prehistoric cultures. Recent work jn the Enumciaw area, and in and adjacent to
the Straits of Georgia, suggests a protracted cultural sequence and possibly an older
maritime subsistence pattern than has been supposed. (34)
Grady, Mark A, (Arizona State Museum) CONSERVATION ARCHAEOLOGY,
RESEARCH, AND ENVIRONMENTAL LAW. An increasing concern for the conservation
of cultural remains is leading to the establishment of guidelines directing implementation of
archaeological research within the broader frarmework of land management privrities, and
environmental law. A potential conflict exists in terms of reconciling the needs of this
research with some interpretations of relevant legislation. In particular, [he procedures now
being employed for determining National Register site eligibility and allocating certain
contracted archaeological funds do not follow the intent of the National Historic
Preservation Act of the Archaeological and Historic Conservation Act. These procedures nal
only weaken the broad-based legislative support for archaeology, but seriously constrain
archaeological research flexibility. A complementary approach, integrating the Natianal
Register evatuation process with National Environmental Poticy Act decision-making, is
proposed. Central to this alternative is the acceptance of a usable concept of significance,
and some suggestions are made for defining archaeological significance to better fit research
needs within the parameters defined by due process. (3!)

AND SUBSISTENCE AS SEEN FROM THE ALBANY SITE IN NORTHWESTERN
ILLINOIS. In the northern portion of the region occupied by Middie Woodland societies
with Havana Tradition ceramics, there evolved early Late Woodland societies characterized
by Weaver Ware ceramics. Excavation reports from Weaver sites have produced a variety of
data on Weaver materia! culture and subsistence practices. These data are compared and
contrasted with recently recovered data from test excavations at the Albany site in
northwestern Illinois. Comparisons indicate a variety of cultural continuities and discon-
tinuities in the process of the evolution of Weaver out of Havana. (9)

obsidian, glass, metals, semiprecious stones, etc., is now nearly 20 years of age, and it is time
to examine critically the nature af the information generated, the impact of modern
statistical-taxonomic data handling systems, and the value of this kind of “hard data” to the |
archaeologist. It will be shown that the technique has value in the systematic organization of
archaeological ceramics into groups on the basis of chemical composition; that other kinds
of physical examination (petrographic thin section, x-ray diffraction) yield data which
merge with, reinforce or supplement, but do not replace, neutron activation analysis (and
vice versa); and that in certain instances the techniques, when taken in conjunction with
purely archaeological evidence, can lead to good indications, though hardly proof, of
geographic origin. The pitfalls of the use of this technique will also be explored within the
framework of the probabilistic arguments arising from the multivariate analysis of the
analytical data. Additional, and severe, difficulties owing to non-comparability of data
because of problems of standardization, will also be mentioned. Finally, the effect of

Hill, Frederick C. (Bloomsburg) ARCHAEOLOGICAL AQUATIC FAUNAL REMAINS AS
AN AID TO THE RECONSTRUCTION OF THE PALEOENVIRONMENT. Fish and
freshwater mussel remains found in archaeological sites can provide a wealth of
ethnoecological data if carefully analyzed. Archaeologists should be aware of the types of
data available from these two faunal resources and the methods which must be utilized to
prepare the materials for analysis. Freshwater mussel shells from archaeological sites have
jong been neglected as a source of biological and cultural information. Gross habitat
requirements of the various species found in a site are usually all that is discussed. Shell
morphology, growth rate, and chemical composition, as well as ecological implications of
the species assemblage al! reveal certain facets of the stream environment from which the
fresnwater mussels originated. Season of site occupation is also determinable from certain
freshwater mussel shells. Likewise, fisnh remains excavated from an archaeological site can
provide seasonality and ecological data which can be invaluable in an environmental
reconstruction of an archaeological site. However, in order to study these various
parameters, the shells, bones, or scales must be well preserved and carefully excavated.
Precautions necessary in excavating the aquatic faunal materials as well as specific studies
which have been carried out in my lab are discussed. (25)
Hirth, Kenneth (INAH, Cuernavaca) THE EVOLUTION OF A GATEWAY COMMUNITY:
CENTRAL MEXICAN SYMBIOSIS ALONG THE “OLMEC" TRADE ROUTE. In the past,
archaeologists have stressed the importance of long distance status good exchange for the
emergence of stratified society during the Formative phase of Mesoamerican prehistory.
Although this type of commerce was certainly important, we know extremely little about
its most ater characteristic, its developmental impact on the formation of regional
redistributional economic systems. This is an especially critica) gap in our understanding of
Mesoamerican cultural evolution since we stress the importance of regional symbiosis and
| periodic regional markets for supporting later Classic and Postclassic civilization, It is the
; purpose of this paper to examine the function and importance of tong distance trade for the
| emergence of regional symbiosis in the Central Mexican Highlands. A modet is constructed
within the theoretical embodiment of economic geography which accounts for the interplay
of long distance and regional economies as well as the emergence of market centers and
ports-of-trade. This mode! is then tested with data on the socio-economic evolution of
Chalcatzingo im eastern Morelos, Mexico, a community which maintained an important
position in both longdistance and regional market networks during the first half of the

Houart, Gall (Northwestern) MICRO-STYLE ANALYSIS OF CERAMICS AND THE

IN THE ILLINOIS VALLEY. During Middie Woodland times, communities within the
iNinois Valley participated in the Hopewell interaction Sphere. One aspect of this
involvement is the movement of exotic trade goods and raw materials throughout much of
the Midwest-Riverine area. It has been hypothesized that this interaction was mediated
through a hierarchical series of sites (nodes). In the illinois Valley, relatively stable groups of
communities comprise the basic social unit which would have participated in the Interaction
Sphere. Micro-style analysis of utilitarian ceramics from Middle Woodland sites in this area |
indicates that it may be possible to identify the geographic boundaries and constituent
communities for these hypothesized social groups. (6) |

PLEISTOCENE. Local group sizes are estimated for Basal Pleistocene populations
responsible for the accumulation of 16 debris scatters in Beds | and I! at Olduvai Gorge,
Tanzania, Estimates are obtained using a modification of Nordbeck's (1971) allometric
. growth formula, a log/log regression of area On population (Area = a -population” where a is
a density function and b is a theoretically derived exponent based on the dimensions of the
surface measured). Nordbeck transformed the law of allometric growth making estimation
of populations of unknown size possible when density and area of occupation were known
or could be approximated. Wiessner (1974) subsequently tested Nordbeck's formula with
Yellen's !Kung Bushmen data. Her study confirmed that an allometric relationship also
existed between settlement area and group size for Bushman bands. At Olduvai, total floor
area had first to be estimated for each site, as excavation was seldom complete and no
random sampling techniques were used. Conservative and liberal estimates were made, local
group size computed and expressed as a range. Although plausible results were obtained,
two assumptions built into the procedure limit its usefulness. They are: (1) the use of
Wiessner's constants which, although empirically derived, have not been widely tested; and
(2) the subjective element involved in the determination of floor areas for partially
excavated sites. (40)

THROUGH FAUNAL ANALYSIS. Three major aspects of zooarchaeological research have
been emerging over the last few years. Most prominent are the economic and environmental
studies. However, archaeologists are becoming aware of a third area in zZooarchaeological
research, that of behavioral studies. Basic to archeeclogical interpretation is the theory that
human behavior is patterned and that by studying cuftural remains, at least some patterns of
a culture can be reconstructed. Within Zooarchaemleey, the reconstruction of human
46
q
, behavioral or social patterns is based on the integration and interpretation of data generated
from the economic and environmental studies. The reconstructions (speculations) are
attempts to understand why an activity area or utilization pattern is structured as it is. One
of the most fruitful areas of analysis for reconstruction is the behavioral activities involved
with bison Kil and butchering sites, particularly during the Paleo-indian period on the
Plains. For at least the southern High Plains, size of kill, bone disposal, and butchering
patterns change during this period which reflects a changing behavioral activity responding
to a changing environment. (25)

to suggest ways of solving these problems. Sometimes it is necessary to recall data which
relate to a particular research problem but are contained in separate files—for example, all

King, Mary Elizabeth (Texas Tech) THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL TEXTILES OF NORTH
AMERICA: AN OVERVIEW. When prehistoric North American textile production is
surveyed, patterns begin to emerge and certain hypotheses are suggested. From about 8000
B.C. ta the time of European contact, twining, knotted netting, looping, oblique interlacing
and other non-woven, or non-heddie-loom, techniques are Prevalent in all parts of North
America except the Southwest. Clearly, weaving in the Southwest was introduced from
Mexico, probably about A.D. 700, as has been Previously suggested. Throughout the rest of
the continent there is amazing uniformity, both geographically and temporally. At least
some of the basic techniques used in the textile industry were almost certainly brought from
the old world. (16)

its enactment—at least in its présent, complex form. My misgivings arise largely from the
facts that (a) the Act is used by some federal agencies as a smokescreen behind which
noncompliance with historic preservation procedures can be hidden, and (b) the existence of
the Act tempts some archaeologists to ignore and/or denjgrate historic preservation

Kraft, Herbert C. (Seton Hall) DELAWARE INDIANS ORIGINS IN THE DELAWARE
VALLEY. Previous interpretations which characterize New Jersey sites in terms of New
York State typologies as "‘Owasco"’ or “lroquois-like’"’ have deprived the Lenape Indians of
any substantial heritage, and tended to show them as recipients of, rather than active
contributors to, the prehistoric cultural diversity of the Northeast. A decade of intensive
archaeological excavations of deeply stratified sites, coupled with numerous radiocarbon
dates, have now demonstrated that the Lenape (Delaware Indians) and their ancestors had a
long developmental history in the Upper Delaware Valley and contiguous areas. Moreover,
this history is demonstrably different from that of the Owasco and/or troquois, although
there are similarities in ceramics, masking complexes, and other phenomena in the two

Krinsiey, O. HH. (Queens, CUNY) APPLICATION OF SAND GRAIN SURFACE-
TEXTURAL ANALYSIS TO ARCHAEOLOGY. Certain sediment analysis techniques
which permit the recognition of ancient environments are or could be of use in archaeology.
A relatively new technique, the analysis of the surface textures of quartz sand grains with
the scanning electron microscope (SEM) is discussed with examples taken from geology and
archaeology. The surface relief observed on quartz sand grains is either physical or chemical
in nature; it may be the result of action by wind, running water, or glaciation if physical. .
Occasionally, more than one environment can be observed on a single grain of sand,
permitting a great deal of information to be obtained. Quartz grains from a number of
localities at the Meadowcroft archaeological site at Avella, Pennsylvania were studied and
compared with grains collected from a cliff above the site. Radiocarbon dates at the site area
were available and thus it was possible to study the changes with time that occurred on sand
grain surfaces. Minute post-depositional changes in the sediment were therefore available for
examination. None of the grains at the site was affected by wind, water, or glacial transport.
The deposit is colluvial in nature. At the present time, chert artifacts are being studied with
the SEM and compared with chert from various outcrops within a wide geographic area. it
should be possibile to determine the original location of many chert tools by observing
surface variation at high magnification. (2) 4“

21-22. Since 1880 numerous unsuccessful efforts have been made to explain the joining of
one apparent Calendar Round marked by 52 year-bearer days in regular sequence, with an
enigmatic sequence among the Nine Night Lords. Caso has described these failures at length
(1967:112-29), without offering a solution of his own. The connection that was intended
. by the Precolumbian scribe, however, is a simple one, It is best explained by supplying proof
that the puzzling sequence of the Nine Night Lords becomes a repeating series after the
completion of two periodic expansions of the apparent Calendar Round. All conditions of
| Mesoamerican calendrical computation are satisfied by this solution with the use of but one
assumption of continuity (proven by J. E.S. Thompson in 1929 for the Maya series of Nine
Night Lords). The solution proposed here for these two pages in Codex Borbonicus gives rise
to no further problems intrinsic to the connection of the expanded Calendar Round with
the Nine Night Lords, nor is the solution contradicted by any other primary source now
known to students. (26, 27)
| Kurjack, Edward B. (Western Illinois) PRECOLUMBIAN POLITIES AND COMMUNITIES
IN NORTHWEST YUCATAN. Urbanism and state formation in the Precolumbian Maya
lowlands can now be examined in light of new information on community form and
distribution from northwest Yucatan, Mexico. Analysis of aerial photography has elucidated
the nature of Maya community form and distribution, two traditional concerns of
settlement and community pattern research. Changes in political structure through time can
be studied by inspecting the spatial distribution of energy expended in ancient construction;
| this procedure is a departure from the usual strategy of settlement research. Small pyramids
erected in late Formative times dot the landscape, but larger Classic architecture is
concentrated in fewer locations. This evidence from Yucatan suggests that the crucial aspect
of state formation involves increased centralization of authority, including development of
mechanisms by which the resources of household units are marshaled for use at increasingly
distant locations. (3)

a background for the discussions of settlement and subsistence systems. The settlement and
subsistence data for the Late Woodland of the Kaskaskia are examined and models are
presented to account for the observed patterns, their relationship to each other, as well as
their articulation with the reconstructed environmental! system of the valley. From the
models of settlement and subsistence that are constructed, a proposed model of Late
Woodland social organization is derived and presented. It is designed to account for the
settlement pattern, its relationship to the natural environment, and the reguiation and

Lavine-Lischka, Leslie (Colorado State) DUALITY IN ANCIENT MAYAN ECONOMICS. A
dual economic system manifests itself in present-day Mesoamerica, especially in aréas
designated as Indian. This Guality can be described as localized trade and long-distance
trade. The localized trade areas consist of groups of villages each specializing in one or more
products, intergependent om each other for specific products and interspersed with
non-specialized wiliages ali focusing on a local market center. The long distance trade
exchanges a different set of tems, mecessary items not found locally, and exotics, The social
units involved are targer than the village units. It is proposed that this duality of the
economic system existed in Precolumbian times and can be substantiated and geographically
specified by astute use of the archaeological record and future archaeological fieldwork. The
work at hand is to identify local trade areas and the products exchanged and to determine
the number of long-distance trade units amd their social interactions. (12)

Magnus, R. W. (Banco Central de Nicaragua) THE PRE- AND POST-CONQUEST
CULTURAL ECOLOGY OF THE ATLANTIC COAST OF NICARAGUA: A CONTRAST.
The presently available archaeological data for the Atlantic coastline of Nicaragua suggest an
entirely different subsistence pattern than is seen in ethnohistorical documents and among
the modern peoples of the zone. Rather than having a very strongly marine oriented
economy, the pre-Conquest peoples were abparently poorly adapted to the rivers, sea, and
lagoons and exploited them as a secondary food source. In fact, it appears that they lived
somewhat inland and that their ecology was based primarily on agriculture. They seem to
have traveled ta the lagoons and sea irreguiarly for hunting and fishing. Cultural and
| ecological data will be presented to substantiate this hypothesis. Finally, some elements will
be suggested which could have induced this change from agriculture to fishing as a primary
food source. (14)

Mesa Project in the eighth field season of its continuing work on Black Mesa, Arizona.
Flotation samples from three sites (two Dinnebito phase sites—A.D, 875-1000, and one
Wepo/Lomoki transitional site-A.0.1000-1050) will be discussed in terms of seasonality,
paleoenvironment, and differential cultural adaptations. An extensive survey of the modern
vegetational regime will be utilized to provide input into the seasonal! and spatial availability
of various botanical resources and to reconstruct the environment of the Kayenta &nasazi.

Mitchell, Robert (Southern Illinois-Edwardsville) NEW PERSPECTIVES ON PUEBLO
MINERAL UTILIZATION, Little attention has been focused on mineral utilization among
the pueblos, particularly with respect to cultural interaction (j.e., gathering and/or mining
and dispersal through trade or reciprocity). This study attempts to establish correlations
between sites and known mineral deposits. Obviously, geologically Known deposits and
those that were aboriginally exploited do not necessarily correspond; some deposits may
have been totally exploited while others may be presently unknown. Available information
supports a number of positive conclusions concerning the data. Finally, the study affords
suggestions for data collection techniques which will improve the potential for positive
correlations in future studies. (29)

IN THE UPPER DELAWARE VALLEY OF PENNSYLVANIA, This paper presents new

Delaware Valley af Pennsylvania during the Late Woodland period (ca. A.D. 1600). Data
collecteat by flotation of sojl from natural bands within features at the Faucett site in
Busbkill provide evidence of a floodplain occupation commencing in mid-summer and
terminating in fate fall. These data suggest intensive processing of seasonally abundant wild
Plants and, to a lesser degree, animals. Possible causes of data skewing and the formulation
of a modified research design for confirmatory evidence are also discussed. (36)
Montet-White, Anta (Mansas) VARIABILITY OF LATE PALEOLITHIC OF SOUTH

stations occUpied for no More than 2 few days; a probable workshop. A system mode! is
used to analyze and Gispray the variability within and between artifact assemblages from
these sites. The system goals are (1) to determine patterns associated to “‘properties'’ or
characteristics of the sites; (2) to recognize the elements characteristic to the late pateolithic
tradition in the area. (40)

ARGENTINE PASS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE IN CENTRAL COLORADO.
An archaeological survey of the right-of-way of a Public Service of Colorado transmission
line indicated unusual site density in high mountain valleys on both approaches to Argentine
Pass. Fifteen sites containing artifactual materials representing the Paleo-Indian, archaic, and
late prehistoric periods were found. Specimens were primarily flaked Guartzite and |
chalcedony, with ground stone coming from one site and Plains affiliated ceramics from
another. Some sites are interpreted to be short term, probably functionally specific sites for
tool reworking and game preparation. Others are single component or multi-component
occupation sites, reflecting seasonal harvesting of floral and faunal resources. (45)

Mulinski, Thomas (Arizona) THE USE OF FETAL MATERIAL AS A MEASUREMENT OF |
STRESS AT GRASSHOPPER PUEBLO. While demographic investigations are becoming |
more prevalent in studying the dynamics of prehistoric society, it is also becoming clear that
conceptually there are two ways of approaching population size, structure, and distribution,
j.e., demographic variables can be viewed as either dependent or independent. This paper
argues that demographic variables are indeed the result of environmental (physical,
biological, and socio-cultural) factors and can serve indirectly as measures of environmental
stress. Furthermore, a series of hypotheses concerning the aggregation and abandonment of
a large prehistoric southwestern Pueblo, Grasshopper Ruin, in east central Arizona will be
considered using data specifically on population composition, The major emphasis here is
not to attempt a thorough examination of these hypotheses but to show the feasibility of
using information of fetal individuals as well as other subadults and incidentally to point out
the utility of other biological measures in assessing a population response to stress. With
respect to Grasshopper Puebio, of 530 individuals analyzed so far in preliminary fashion
only, 37 (6.9%) of them are the remains of fetuses; another 20 (3.7%) are either late term
fetuses or neonate; all of the subadults combined account for 64.1% of the skeletal sample.
The percentage of fetal individuals present suggests rather adverse environmental conditions.
However, these data alone do not seem to support the idea, as suggested by the floral and
faunal evidence, that there was more stress earlier in the occupation of the site than later.

Muller, Jon (Southern Illinois) KINCAID SITES AND SOUNDINGS: ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RESEARCH, 1967-76. The research program of the Black Bottom Project of the Southern
iHinois University Field Schoo! in Archaeology has resulted in an unusually complete
picture of settlement during Mississippian times in the lower Ohio Valley. The first phase of
the project, which still continues, is aimed at achieving virtually total site location survey for
the Kincaid site environs, The survey is virtually complete for the Black Bottom surrounding
Kincaid, but survey is being continued with a sampling of areas farther away from the
central site. A second phase of research is beginning to test ideas about the nature of the
relationships of the inhabitants of the various sites around Kincaid to each other and to the
central mound group inhabitants. Surface survey and test excavations at numerous
small-to-medium size sites suggest that Mississippian population size in the Kincaid
community was similar to the societies described by the first European explorers elsewhere
in the Southeast. (42)

indeed, this may extend to more than the mere computerization of the data but to the
integration of the various sources of the data. A systems approach is taken in the analysis of

O'Brien, Patricia J. (Kansas State) KANSAS CITY AREA SETTLEMENT PATTERNS. This
paper compares the settlement patterns of two drainages of the Missouri River within the
Kansas City area. Brush Creek, at present a tributary of the Missouri, has 50 prehistoric sites
while Camp Branch, a tributary of the Little Platte River—20 miles in from the Missouri, has
nine prehistoric sites. Brush Creek has occupations of Archaic (40%), Kansas City Hopewell
(17%), Late Woodland (13%), and Steed-Kisker (30%). Camp Branch has Archaic (73%),
Kansas City Hopewell (14%), and Steed-Kisker (7%) occupations. These data suggest the
Camp Branch area-—an extreme upland forest-prairie boundary zone -was occupied most
densely by peoples who were thought to be hunters and gatherers. The tater agricultural
Steed-Kisker people seem to prefer the tributaries nearer to the Missouri! River and its
resources as did the Late Woodland populations. (45)
O’Connell, Barbara Heminger (Northwestern) ADAPTIVE EFFICIENCY IN THE LOWER
ILLINOIS VALLEY: FLUCTUATING ASYMMETRY AS A MEASURE OF DEVELOP-
MENTAL HOMEOSTASIS. The fluctuating asymmetry of various bilaterally measurable
metric and non-metric skeletal traits offers a potentially useful means for assessing the
adaptive efficiency of paleopopulations. The use of fiuctuating asymmetry as such a
measure is adapted from developmental genetics research, where asymmetry is used as an
indicator of developmental homeostasis. !t has been demonstrated that fluctuating
asymmetry is greatest and therefore development teast stable during periods of environ-
mental change with subsequent adaptation to the new environment resulting in a
stabilization or canalization of development and corresponding symmetry. This study
investigates the patterns of asymmetry in Woodland and Mississippian populations from the
lower Iilinois Vailey. (6)
Otsen, Stanley J. (Arizona) DOMESTICATED ANIMALS IN PREHISTORIC SOUTH-

DOG. Two animals were domesticated by inhabitants of the prehistoric southwestern
United States. These were the turkey (Meleagris gallopavo) and the domestic dog (Canis
familiaris). Three groupings of dogs of differing sizes and proportions are recognized from
archaeological sites in the southwest. All of these are well defined Gomesticates and are in
no way the ancestral types, as yet undiscovered. The possible ancestry of the domestic dog
in the New World and the taxonomic position of these later more advanced forms are
compared and discussed. The turkeys were well established as domesticates from at least
carly Basketmaker times. Eggshells, poults, and pens indicate the importance of this bird to
the early inhabitants of North America. (25)
Osborn, Alan (New Mexico) ACONITE AND OLD SLATES: A SUGGESTED EXPLANA-
TION FOR CHANGES IN LITHIC RESOURCE UTILIZATION. As early as 187! Oluf
Rygh pointed out the striking similarities between ground slate lithic assemblages of
northeastern North America and Scandinavia specifically Norway and Sweden. Since that
time archaeologists have found similar slate implements in Labrador, Alaska, the Northwest
Coast, the Aleutian Isiands, Eastern Russia, China, and Lake Baikal in interior U.S.S.R. Most
of the discussions concerning these slate too! assemblages have focused upon the problem of
“origins’’ of the slate grinding technology and its subsequent diffusion throughout the
Arctic. Relatively abrupt changes in lithic resources involving a shift from siliceous or
igneous raw materials to siate have generally been attributed to either diffusion of
technology, invasions of Eskamoan groups, or to exhaustion of local raw materials. The aim
of this paper is to present an argument for the shift in lithic materials and assemblages based
upon the exigencies Of early sea Mammal hunting by hunter-gatherers living between 40°
and 70 north latitude and the use of plant alkaloid poisons such as aconite. (40)

Otero, Lorraine M. (Americas) OPHIDIAN CHARACTERISTICS AS A CLUE TO
UNDERSTANDING OLMEC ICONOGRAPHY. This paper proposes that the general
acceptance of an early based Jaguar Cult and its evolution into later serpent/feathered,
serpent/rain cults obscures the role played by the reptile in Olmec iconography. By assigning
a developmental sequence that begins with the jaguar and explaining later deviations from
the basic jaguar form as progressive abstractions, we are oversimplifying the case. The
appearance of various reptilian elements in contexts previously assigned to the jaguar
suggests that further analysis is needed. It is therefore hypothesized that by isolating those
elements which are purely ophidian in character and demonstrating their iconographic use,
it can be shown that the reptile was an integral as well as a separate part of the Olmec belief
system. The depiction of ophidian fangs, with the inclusion of the poison canal and poison
duct, appear on monumental sculpture, reliefs, and portable objects. The assignment of
fangs with poison canals or ducts to the jaguar repertoire is therefore erroneous, and limits
our understanding of the significance of both the jaguar and the serpent motifs and their use
in Olmec belief systems. (23)

Parmalee, Paul W. (Tennessee) THE AVIFAUNA FROM PREHISTORIC ARIKARA SITES
IN SOUTH DAKOTA. During an approximate 15-year period trom about 1950 to 1965,
numerous anthropologists representing at least a dozen institutions were periodically
involved in archaeological salvage of Plains sites in the Middie Missouri Valley. !m most
instances, the cultural aspects of subsistence and the utilization of native fauna in general
were not of primary interest, and the vast quantities of then-available midden fauna were
not adequately sampled. Nevertheless, some animal bones were salvaged, and this discussion
involves the study of the avian remains from 42 prehistoric Arikara sites along the Missour;
River in South Dakota. Approximately 2,700 bird elements, representing about 60 species,
were identified. Although mammals, especially the bison, elk, deer, and pronghorn, provided
the greatest quantity of meat in the diet of these people, birds were also of special
significance as supplemental food (e.g., waterfowl, grouse) and because of the part they
played in the cultural and ceremonial activities of the Plains Indian. The predominance of :
remains of such groups as eagles, hawks, falcons, owls, and ravens in these sites is indicative
of their special cultural significance; in some instances, such as eagle trapping by the Hadatsa
and Mandan, they can be correlated with ethnohistoric accounts dealing with the utilization
of birds. (25)

precise identification of mineral and/or organic constituents found in the pottery allows the
researcher to suggest various archaeological explanations for the variation observed. The
presence of grog tempering in the Mississippi River valley provides a wealth of data for
speculations regarding the reuse of pottery as temper. A shift to shell tempering is viewed in
its functional aspects and points to a technological innovation by prehistoric potters;
allowing them to utilize a wide variety of muds for paste with less fear of failure.
Experimentation with fired test tiles of local mud sources has been useful in reconstructing
the possible materials used by prehistoric potters of the St. Louis area. (11)

data, twelfth century pueblos and a medieval Moroccan town. Three basic principles are
advocated to maximize potentially interpretable information. (1) The state of the
archaeological record was caused by a series of semi-independent behavioral variables.
Archaeological material exists in a form that can be recorded according to numerous
semi-independent attributes. Consequently, information should be recorded and analysis
proceed so as to maintain the diversity of information, i.e., patterning should be first sougnt
at the attribute level and only subsequently should these attributes be clustered into types
and the patterning of types delineated. (2) Wherever feasible, the attribute values should be
organized into a nested system. (3) The various categories of information must be collected
in a compatibie format so that analysis can combine artifactual, architectural, and
depositional data, as well as Integrating unit by unit tallies with item by item attribute
studies. (33)
Reed, Nelson (Washington-St. Louis) VERIFICATION AND STRATEGIES IN EXPERI-

experimental replication. Various degrees of limitation must be accepted, depending on the ;
complexity of the artifact or process under study, and these limitations are in inverse ratio
to the level of verification that can be reached. An interaction with other subsystems of the
material culture are a necessary but complicating factor. These arguments will be supported
by examples of work done on digging tools, pottery, and basic resources. (21)

MISSISSIPPIAN EXAMPLE FROM THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY A.D. Three partially-
excavated Mississippian sites have been racdiocarbon-dated to approximately 4.D. 1200. No
sites in the Black Bottom except Kincaid retain any surface evidence of large-scale
construction, which at Kincaid is believed to postdate 1250. if nodal centers existed in the
settlement system before monumental construction marked them, then it is hypothesized
that the presence of significantly larger proportionate amounts of pottery fashioned along
lines dictated by other than utilitarian needs will identify such nodal sites. Results of inter-
and intra-site ceramic comparisons, employing the chi-square Statistic, tend to confirm the
hypothesis. (42)

Rubertone, Patricia E. (SUNY Binghamton) INTERACTION IN A COMPLEX SOCIETY:
INFERENCES FROM CERAMIC ATTRIBUTE ANALYSIS. The nature of interaction and
ways of measuring these processes in artifact assemblages are critical to the explanation of
cultural behavior. In its most genera) sense interaction involves an interchange of energy,
information, goods, and services or the movement of people. These processes may take place
on a variety of levels: between individuals; between multiple groups; between communities;
or in other cases between regions. It is possible to identify the type of interaction and
delimit the entities involved by focusing on the variability within classes of ceramic
attributes- morphological, technological, decorative, and metrical, and their jnterrelation-
ships. This analysis will focus on the medieval port-fortress of Qsar es-Seghir and examine
patterns of interaction as they are reflective of the demographic and organizational
variability within the population, Ceramic analysis includes detailed morphological attribute
recording systems which along with alternate lines of data will be used to infer interaction
processes. (33)
Sackett, James R. (UCLA) UPPER PALEOLITHIC ASSEMBLAGE VARIABILITY IN THE
PERIGORD IN SOUTHWESTERN FRANCE. Excavation in more than 150 of the
Perigord’s rich cave and abri shelter sites has established the world’s most elaborate and
complex succession of Upper Paleolithic industries. This paper reviews the history of
thought regarding the significance of assemblage variability in this regional succession, laying
special emphasis upon recent evidence and argument concerning the apparent con-
temporaneity of certain assemblages which differ considerably from one another in terms of
the established systematics. In addition, it summarizes the results of new excavations of
open air sites in the region, which~aside from the valuable information of intra-site
variability provided by their broad and highly structured occupation surfaces are highly
relevant because their many novelties indicate by contrast that an appreciation of Upper |
Paleolithic variability based upon the shelter evidence alone must inherently be skewed and
incomplete. (40)
Sanger, David (Maine) MAN AND PALEO-ENV!IRONMENTS IN CENTRAL MAINE. Man's .
access to and movements within Maine were primarily controlied by the distribution of
glacial ice, land, and sea in early post-glacial times. By at least 12,000 B_P. the land was clear
of ice and covered with a tundra vegetation. The few fluted points are presumed to be
associated with the tundra. A dramatic shift in vegetation occurred at 10,000 B.P. with
increasing amounts of pine, birch, and oak. Sea levels rose from -60m. to 6m. By 3000
B.P. with high tidal amplitudes in the Guif of Maine after 4000 B.P. Following a jong period
of low human activity, there was an infiux of a Laurentian-related culture about 5000 B-P_, .
coincident with an increase in deciduous taxa. A shift in pollen to modern conditions was
accompanied by a replacement of the indigenous cultures by @ Susquehanna-related |
population by about 3700 B.P. From that point until the historic the cultural record
suggests populations adapting to essentially modern coastal and interior environments, (28) '

Woodland skeletal samples from Michigan and Southern Ontario with an emphasis upon

higher frequency of gross linear enamel hypoplasia, and possibly a ijower life expectancy

differences is the interaction between the Native Americans and European traders. Such an
explanation is consistent with both historic and recent accounts of contact between
industrialized peoples and non-industrialized populations around the world. In light of this
evidence, a model is presented which attempts a general reconstruction of pre- and

Scheick, Cherie (Arizona) A CASE OF THE BOSTON TEA PARTY: 1976. In an effort to
ensure “professional standards,"' an archaeological register has been proposed. The authors
suggest that the proposal is premature unless the senior members of the profession accept
the responsibility of encouraging, promoting and guiding junior members in attaining those
standards. As a representative body of the profession, the Society for American
Archaeology has the potential for establishing a precedent ajlang these lines By actively
seeking junior member participation in Society affairs. Specific proposals for participation
in the various functional levels are suggested. This paper is a call for legitimization of junior
professionals through active involvement and for cooperation and communication between
all facets of the profession for ensuring professional standards. (31)

sequence, four of which relate to the Mississippian Period. Paieoecological reconstructions
are not provided as inadequate control data reduces any such reconstruction to something

Shafer, Harry J. (Texas A&M) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF HINDS CAVE: A
PRELIMINARY REPORT. During the summer of 1975, major excavations were begun in :
Hinds Cave, a large, dry rockshelter site in southwest Texas. The objectives during this first
season were to obtain stratigraphically controlled samples of plant macrofossils and human
coprolites from deposits dating back to at least the Early Archaic (ca. 5,000 B.P.) period. At
the same time, a second objective was to recover an equally well-controlled sampte of
material culture elements from these same deposits. These objectives were more than met,
since over 1,000 prehistoric human coprolites were collected from a stratified sequence of
lenses dating from approximately 1,000 B.P. to older than 8,280+60 B.f. Excetient plant
macrofossil and material culture samples were also secured. An intensive series of

Sidrys, Raymond (UCLA) STANDARDIZATION OF MESOAMERICAN FIELD DATA.
The testing of processual cultural hypotheses in the Mesoamerican culture area is hindered

Without such units it is unlikely that significant intellectual progress can be achieved in a

data. As appendices in Mesoamerican site reports, such tables would facilitate the testing of

Skirboll, E. (Pittsburgh) FLORAL REMAINS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER,
The floral assemblage from Meadowcroft Rockshelter, as derived from dry and wet
screening procedures, includes thousands of plant remains ranging from tree banches and
limbs, with and without bark, to minute seeds, seed coats, roots, and rootlets. The floral
remains span nearly the entire occupation sequence and include both non-domesticated and
domesticated plants. The character of this assemblage is detailed, and changing patterns of
Plant exploitation through time are discussed. By far the most common plant remains
recovered at Meadowcroft (both in the screens and flotational samples) are charred and
uncharred seeds of the hackberry (Celtis occidentalis) or dwarf hackberry (Celtis
tennuifolia). Charred and uncharred nut shells, notably walnut (Juglans spp.) and hickory
(Carya spp.), are common throughout the deposits as are seeds of Chednopodium (spp.),
Vaccinium (spp.), and Rubus (spp.). Interestingly, some nut shells as well as charred
chenopod seeds have been recovered from Stratum ita, though not on the lowest
occupational floor. Domesticated plants recovered at Meadowcroft include corn (Zea mays)
from the latest levels and squash (Cucurbita pepo) from Stratum IV and above. The limited
Gata currantly at hand suggest that the principal materials exploited for consumption at
Meadowcroft were hackberry, chenopods, and, to a somewhat lesser extent, nuts and other
berries. (2)

Similarly, a beginning has been made on an understanding of ethnonutrition, i.e., human
physiological adaptations to available foods. Much of the southeastern U.S. was covered by ;
a climax forest of hardwoods with an intermixture of softwoods which provided an
adequate harvest of plant and animal foods for a limited population. Change to a diet
incorporating cultivated foods occurred slowly and was not complete at the time of first
European contact. Central Mexico, with a severe dry season, had a primary vegetation
ranging from semi-open desert habitats to evergreen forests dispersed in an altitudinal
banding. Change to a diet incorporating cultivated food plants and animals associated with
cultivated plots was both early and complete. (5)

simple methods are usually sufficient for some soils, they may be ineffective for soils which '
contain considerable amounts of clay. Clay colloids, in particular, adhere to botanical
material, retard buoyancy, and complicate the recovery process. Clearly, a method which ;

it is argued that there may exist information of value in the form of horizontal distributions
of various categories of artifactural materials which, if investigated using appropriate field
techniques, could be preserved. Single component sites, especially those which represent
limited activity loci, should be systematically investigated. Several suggestions are made as
to the method of investigation appropriate to such situations. An example is given of the

Strauss, Lawrence G. (New Mexico) NEW LIGHT ON THE UPPER PALEOLITHIC OF
SOUTHWESTERN EUROPE. There is growing evidence that many traditional subdivisions
of the European Upper Paleolithic are functional assemblage variants, and that their strictly
temporal nature has been greatly exaggerated. Individual manifestations of the same |
subdivision are often radiometrically non-contemporaneous. Universalistic stage classifica-
tions based on single stratigraphic sequences are misleading, as demonstrated by new C-14 |
Gates, detailed statistical comparison of assemblages, and new contradictory finds. There is
considerable assemblage variability within single stages, but similarity among particular
assemblages assigned to different stages. Some of this variation and similarity is related to
patterns of faunal exploitation and site jocation, as suggested by data from Cantabrian
Spain. (40) .
Struever, Stuart (Northwestern) CLINICAL TRAINING IN ARCHAEOLOGY AS THE .
DISCIPLINE GROWS MORE COMPLEX. A halimark of modern archaeoslogy is the
proliferation of new field and laboratory techniques. In addition, more and more
archaeological research is conducted within an interdisciplinary tramework. Added to these |
is the sharp increase in the number of long-term, large-scale archaeological projects that .
require careful research design and effective management of human and financial resources.
Accordingly, the professional archaeologist today is required to Know more things on more
subjects than ever before and requires longer training in any specific methodological aréa
before claiming competence. These developments have made the patron-client, tutorial
relationship an inadequate basis for training archaeologists. This paper explores two
programs of the Northwestern University Archeological Program as a means of meeting the
new demands for clinical training in archaeology. (8)

DECIPHERMENT OF HIEROGLYPH T1114.16624 © THE MAYA SIEROGLYPHIC

— a
, ’
CODICES. Verbal hieroglyph 1T114.166:24 is limited to occurrence to the Madrid Codex,
although morphologically similar giyphs appear in Codices Paris and Dresden. These .
linguistically related hieroglyphs are restricted to three clearly distinguishable semantic
contexts within the manuscripts: (1) on Oresden 45b, in a divinatory almanac dealing with ;
the problems of farmers; (2) on Madrid 40a, in a divinatory almanac devoted to the hunting
of deer; (3) on Madrid 107 c (six times), in a divinatory almanac concerned with an aspect of
beekeeping. These diverse environments provide narrow semantic boundaries which are
advantageous for the phonological decipherment of hieroglyph 1T114.166:24, since any
hypothetical reading must meet the requirement that it be consistent with all of the
contexts in which the glyph occurs. A reading of A/a) is proposed for grapheme T114
which—-like -el/hel sian T188/612—may or may not be aspired. Grapheme T1166, used to
denote the syllable i/z- in the glyph for the Maya aoe ltzamna (Knorozov 1967 :85), is
believed to correspond to the closed monosyliable XJtz, with the vowel (x) varying
according to the principle of vocalic harmony. The reading of hieroglyph 17114.166:24
seems to correspond to a form of the verbal root hafz’, meaning: (1) to clear a field in
preparation to sow; (2) to wound; (3) to transfer [bees] from one hive to another. These
significances are strongly supportive of the reading, for they are Farmonious with the known
semantic dimensions of hieroglyph 7114.116:24. (26, 27)

Thomas, Prentice M. (Americas) THE PRODUCTION OF UTILITARIAN IMPLEMENTS
AT BECAN, CAMPECHE. Recent attempts have been made to delineate craft specialities
present among the Lowland Maya of the Classic period (cf. Adams 1970; Becker 1973). For
example, it now seems clear that specialists, versed in the production of obsidian blades,
were practicing their craft during the Classic period, and the same is true for the
manufacturers of obsidian and chert eccentrics. It remains unclear, however, whether the
production of utilitarian artifacts, fashioned from tocally available chert, was a craft
specialty or a home industry. Recent surveys at Becan in southeastern Campeche revealed |
the presence of numerous mounds composed predominantly of chert nodules, the native
material from which utilitarian stone tools were chipped. These concentrations of nodular
chert are not large workshop areas as would be expected if craft specialists were involved,
but seem more like stockpiles of the raw material. In other sectors of the site small
workshop areas have been tentatively identified on or adjacent to several residential plazas,
and chipping debitage was common around most house units. On this basis, it is proposed
that the manufacture of a targe proportion of the utilitarian implements was a household
task, and was not in the hands of a select group of specialists. (3)

as stylized earth-masks—also show clear affinities with the sacred masks and related articles

examination of the historical commemorative scenes in their cosmological contexts indicates
that the inhabitants of Tenochtitlan not only held the universe as sacred, but also modeled
their social order after the structure of the cosmos, and correspondingly validated the

enacted in cosmic settings. (26,27)

CULTIVATION IN NEW YORK STATE. Plants metabolize carbon dioxide photosyn-

C-3 type: C4 plants are primarily grasses adapted to hot, arid environments. Since C-4
plants have a higher '*C/'?C ratio than C-3 plants, animals and humans with a significant
C-4 plant food-intake will have higher '°C/'?C ratios as well. Maize is a C-4 plant, hence
maize cultivators living in C-3 plant environments should show significant tsotopic
differences from hunter-gatherers in their skeletal remains; the importance of maize in their
diet should also be measurable. The practicability of this method is Gemonstrated for New

southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec, trace element analysis by x-ray fiuorescence spectroscopy
is employed to identify their original geologic procurement which sometimes extended over
300 miles. Changes in the network from Early Prectassic through Postclassic times are then
examined and an attempt made to relate them to external economic developments and
political events throughout Mesoamerica. Finally, some possible functional explanations for

Zurel, Richard L. (Georgia) TEMPORAL CHANGES IN OCCUPATION INTENSITY AND
SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS ON THE GEORGIA COAST: EVIDENCE FOR THE ACQUISI-
TION OF AGRICULTURE AND SUBSISTENCE VARIABILITY. The results of a recent
survey on Skidaway Island by DePratter is examined in light of an extensive survey in the
pine barrens region of the coastal plain. Prehistoric ceramic sites in the inland region are
proposed to be seasonal settlements of coastal peoples. An occupational intensity index
tsites/duration of phase) is computed for the two survey regions. There is a general trend of
en increase in land use intensity and population after A.D. 650. The data are interpreted as
representing hunting and gathering systems which exploit the pine barren region (Stallings
island and Deptford) which changes with the advent of maize agriculture during the
Wilmington phase (A.D. 650-1150). The subsequent Savannah phase is a period of social and
economic readjustment with the protohistoric Irene phase (A.D. 1475-1550) emerging with
large settlements near the salt marsh cultivating maize and exploiting estuarine resources.
