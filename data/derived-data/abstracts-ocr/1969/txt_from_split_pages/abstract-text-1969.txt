NUTS FOR HOPEWELLIANS

It has been suggested that differential ewvironmental productivity and
redistribution between residential groups were important economic
bases of Hopewellian social organization. This paper examines this proposition
by focusing on the productivity of edible nut trees, the methods of
preparing nut meats, and their biochemical properties. A model is presented
showing how Hopewellians in the lower Illinois River valley employed a mixed
strategy for procuring this important food resource.

STRUCTURAL RELATIONS BETWEEN DESIGN ELEMENTS AS INDICATORS OF

INTENSITY OF SOCIAL INTERACTION: SOME ARCHEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF

AN ETHNOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS

Variation in painted pottery style, defined here as the design
arrangements used in the village studied, is a sensitive indicator of the
degree of communication between painters. An analysis of decorative
style as a multi-level phenomenon with hierarchic structure leads to
a more precise examination of the manner in which such variation reflects social
interaction and facilitates the choice of accurate indicators from variables
that might be abstracted from a complex design structure.

The present study is based on observations of the patterning of painters'
interaction, diffusion of stylistic elements, and distribution of shared
design features made during 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork in a small
Tarascan village in Michoacan, Mexico. Interaction between painters
followed one of two patterns; 1) most painters worked alone, rarely watching
other people paint or discussing design elements with them; but 2) one
group, comprised of all the painters in one nuclear family, painted together
and exchanged a large amount of information about design. The painters working
together as a group used a distinct substyle; intense interaction within |
this painting group was reflected by the high degree of cohesion exhibited
by the substyle. Using the hierarchic organization of design as a
framework, the features that distinguish this substyle are discussed, Some
implications of the analysis for archaeological studies of decorative styles |
exhibiting similar structures and variability are discussed, |

PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF THE HOGUP CAVE COPROLITES

In a preliminary study of the Hogup Cave coprolites, 27 specimens were
examined for contents. The samples are soaked in an aqueous solution of
trisodium phosphate and screened through graded sieves. The recovered
materials are dried and separated into meal components which are weighed.

The specimens are in 3 temporal groups; group I- prior to 4,000 B.C.
(strata 3-5), group II- centered at 2,000 B.C. (strata 8), and group
ITI- post 1,000 B.C. (strata 11-15). The groups are representative of
2 major prehistoric cultural manifestations, the Desert Archaic (groups I
and II) and the northern variant of Fremont (group III).

Little dietary change is seen during Desert Archaic times when the
major vegetal foods were cactus and chenopod seed; however, significant
relationships exist between components which are consistant with
Desert Archaic food preparation techniques.

. Dietary change is apparent during the Fremont occupation as demonstrated
by a marked drop in the utilization of cactus and chenopod seed and an
increase in fibrous foods.

EVIDENCE OF EARLY MAN IN THE CENTRAL GULF COAST AREA

Several converging lines of evidence indicate pre-projectile point
Lithic Stage occupations in areas of south Louisiana, Mississippi, and
Alabama. Distributions of Paleo Indian .index points suggest that Paleo
Indian hunters roamed throughout the area. Recent stratigraphic studies
and radiocarbon dating of loess deposits contribute to a better inter-
pretation of the human pelvis found in association with extinct animal
bones near Natchez, Mississippi. Radiocarbon dates from undisturbed
core samples have now established a probable date of 9,000 to 10,000
years B.C, for the bed at the Salt Mine Valley site on Avery Island,
south-central Louisiana, in whéch bipolar tools and bones of extinct
vertebrates have been found. Lithic sites near Dothan, Alabama, have
produced copious quantities of chipped artifacts believed to represent

pre-projectile point occupations. Archaic assemblages in the terracelands
of the study area are based on a long tradition of pebble-tool utilization.

CULTURAL DYNAMICS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ONEOTA LIFE-WAY
IN WISCONSIN: AN HYPOTHESIS
An evolutionary and ecological approach is used in defining the causes

DIFFUSIONIST VS DEDUCTIVE EXPLANATION OF THE ORIGINS OF

AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE NORTHERN SOUTHWEST

The development of agricultural settlement systems in the northern
Southwest, beginning about A.D. 500, has. traditionally thought to have been
initiated by "diffusion" or "influences" from regions farther south. It is
argued that explanation by reference to diffusion is not explanation at
all and that we must reorient our research to discover the selective pressures

operating on a cultural system which favor such a development. It is
proposed that increasing population numbers produced enough pressure on natural
resources that more efficient means of subsistence were aan
these means being horticulture coupled with facilities for preservation,
storage, and reconstitution of maize,

ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CENTRAL DES MOINES RIVER VALLEY: A PRELIMINARY

SUMMARY

For the past five and one half years, Iowa State University has been
engaged in the investigation of archaeological manifestations in the central
Des Moines River valley. These investigations have been part of the
salvage program in Red Rock and Saylorville Reservoirs undertaken in
cooperation with the National Park Service.

Surface collections suggest the presence of Paleo-Indian and Archaic
complexes in the valley, but excavated samples cannot yet demonstrate
this occupation. Woodland manifestations, both camp sites and burial
mounds, are present throughout the region. Ceramics are reminiscent of
Havana and Weaver wares, and possibly Black Sand.

South of Des Moines are found sites attributable to Oneota. Four
excaVated components, plus additional test and surface collections, have been
tentatively assigned to the Moingona Phase. North of Des Moines, there
appear to be no Oneota materials, but rather the presence of Great Oasis
manifestations. Two excavated components plus a number of surface
collections have been assigned to this complex.

Historic sites, marking the White settlement of the valley between ca.
1840-1890, have also been investigated. Particularly significant are
the pottery kilns which are associated with coal mining and other early
commercial activities along the Des Moines river.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS OF AIRBORNE INFARED SCANNING IMAGERY AND
PHOTOGRAPHY
In the last decade techniques for obtaining thermal maps of terrain have
been developed by the aerial use of infared scanning devices and infared
color photography. The use of these devices at relatively high altitudes
in Northern Arizona’has resulted in the discovery of prehistoric agricultural
plots and habitation sites. Some of these cultural features are invisible
on inspection from the surface or on conventional black and white photographs.
The utilization of these thermal maps as a tool for archaeological
survey holds great promise. The technical application, advantages, and
disadvantages of these scanning and photographic techniques will be discussed.

A NEW FIGURINE COMPLEX FROM GUERRERO, MEXICO
A series of crude, hand-modeled pottery figurines were noted from
two sites during archaeological survey near Iguala, Guerrero. One
form previously reported, appears to represent the human female in a
pregnant condition. An unusual feature of this variety is that each has
a vertically oriented incision in the thorax portion, which gives rise
to the hypothesis that a Caesarean section may be represented, Other
varieties, not previously published, appear to represent non-pregnant
females, males, or are indeterminable as to sex.
Somewhat similar figurines have been reported in the literature from
other localities in Guerrero, and a unique series in the national museum
of Mexico may be related to this complex. Preliminary indications from
architectural and ceramic associations suggest a post-classic dating for
this complex, perhaps as late as the Aztec period.

ARCHITECTURAL AND CERAMIC STYLES AT LAS HALDAS, PERU
Studies and excavations at Las Ilaldas on the coast of Peru resulted
in a map of the site, an architectural sequence hased on radiocarbon
dates, and a tentative ceramic sequence. The architecture can he related
to buildings on the Central Coast and northern Highlands of Peru. The
ceramics begin with a style which is similar to Kotosh Waira-jirca,
| followed by Chavin style pottery. Inferences about the extent of the pre-
Chavin and Chavin cultural areas are drawn.

NEW OLMEC PAINTINGS FROM GUERRERO: DESCRIPTION AND INFERENCE

Although Olmec art has been archaeologically known since the mid-
1800's, a new facet of Olmec art has only recently come to light:
paintings. The first discovery of Olmec paintings was in 1966, with
the identification of the paintings of Juxtlahuaca cave, Guerrero, as
Olmec. In November, 1968, I investigated a cave near Chilapa, Guerrero.
This cave contained a large quantity of paintings, the majority of
which I have identified as Olmec, The cave, known locally as Oxtotitlan,
is about 15 miles south of the Rio Balsas, and 20 miles north of
Juxtlahuaca cave. Three different types of paintings occur, black
monochrome, red monochrome, and polychrome. The polychrome paintings
occur on the cliff face in front of the cave, and are quite large. The
best preserved of the two major polychrome murals is placed nearly 30
feet high on the cliff and covers an area of about 35 square feet. This
mural depicts an elaborately dressed human figure seated upon a jaguar-
monster head, The second polychrome mural, at the base of the cliff,
covers nearly 100 square feet, but is in poor condition and therefore
difficult to completely interpret. Within the north area of the cave
are at least 10 other Olmec paintings, generally black monochrome. These
paintings include a standing Olmec human figure beside a semi-standing
jaguar, several reptilian creatures which are similar to cipactlis,
and several Olmec baby-face heads. A possible date glyph and a speech
scroll also occur with these Olmec murals. The paintings in the
southern area of the cave are stylistically different; they are
painted in red, usually in simple geometric or linear designs. Several traits
within the various red paintings indicate that they are probably post-
Olmec, possibly even Postclassic. The iconography of the various
Olmec murals is primarily suggestive of an interpretation of fertility ,
water, and rain. Stylistically the paintings appear most closely
related to the bas-reliefs from Chalcatzingo and the art of La Venta. The
location of Oxtotitlan seems to strengthen the "trade route"’ theory
of Olmec presence in central Mexico. Several pre-Hispanic textile fragments
found in the cave during our investigations are probably Postclassic.

APACHES OF EL QUARTELEJO

The remains of two houses, which clesely resemble the Dismal River
Apache houses of western Nebraska, have been excavated in western Kansas
and are attributed to the Quartelejo Apaches. These two houses are located
about a quarter of a mile from the seven room pueblo of "El Quartelejo"
, 21
which is generally thought to have been built by seventeenth century Taos
and/or Picuris refugees who fled to the Plains to live among the Quartelejo
Apaches. Although excavation in and immediately around the pueblo have
been undertaken a number of times since the late nineteenth century, no
other structures had previously been found in the vicinity. Interpreting
the archaeological data in the light of ethnohistorical information
raises various interesting questions.

DISTRIBUTION OF MAMMAL REMAINS FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES ALONG THE
LOWER SNAKE RIVER OF WASHINGTON
Big game mammals, particularly pronghorn antelope and bison, appear
to exhibit a predictable geographic pattern of distribution in archaeological
sites along the lower Snake River of Washington. Deer, elk, and
pronghorn were apparently plentiful throughout prehistoric times. Bison
’ occupied a shorter time range, but were apparently common between 1200 and
2500 years ago.
In extreme eastern Washington, bison remains are present in most sites
containing sediments between 1200 and 2500 years old. Bison remains
are uncommon in the Columbia Basin except in some pit house sites.
Pronghorn exhibit essentially the reverse distributional pattern, being
abundant in sites in the Basin and less common in sites to the east. The
apparent bison-pronghorn boundary is also reflected by a change in
distribution of certain rodent species and by significant differences in
vegetation.

EXCAVATIONS AT TUKUTO LAKE, NORTIIERN ALASKA
Tukuto Lake is located in the Etivluk River drainage, Brooks Range,
northern Alaska. Excavations there during the summer of 1968 were
supported by the National Science Foundation. The site consists of 120 late
prehistoric/early historic Eskimo houses and more than 400 cache pits.
The house types represented include deep semi-subterranean "typical"
houses, shallow semi-subterranean houses, "half" houses, shallow
oval tent floors and circular tent floors. Seven houses and a considerable
portion of the deep midden were excavated. A preliminary analysis of the
recovered artifacts suggests the major occupation of the site was between
A.D. 1800-1900. This was a critical period in terms of culture change in
northern Alaska.

LATE DORSET ESKIMO ART FROM NEWFOUNDLAND

An analysis of art-forms in bone and ivory from the Dorset site known
as Port aux Choix-2 , in northwestern Newfoundland, dating from the
period 100-600 A.D. The carvings include realistic animal sculptures in the
round, and highly abstract derived forms. Comparison of material
excavated from twenty different house pits indicates the essential

-  velationship of this local genre with ancestral Dorset culture in Foxe
Basin and the surrounding region. Newfoundland Dorset art also demonstrates
the evolution of provincial style in a context of strong cultural
conservatism.

CLOVIS OCCUPATION OF THE SAN PEDRO VALLEY, ARIZONA

Mammoth hunters using Clovis projectile points occupied the San
Pedro Valley of Arizona between 9500 and 9000 B.C. Two of the five
buried sites have been radiocarbon dated and the other three are believed to
be of similar age on the basis of geological correlations.

The Murray Springs Clovis site has yielded new data especially about
temporary hunting camps. Similar data can be expected at the Lehner
site when excavations are extended away from the banks of the ancient
creek.

No occupations earlier than Clovis are known from the valley in
spite of extensive investigations of abundant deposits containing
numerous fossil localities of Rancholbrean game animals,

A cultural hiatus exists between the Clovis occupation and sites of
the Chiricahua stage of .the Cochise culture of approximately 4,000 B.C.
Buried sites of the Sulpher Springs stage are not known in the San Pedro
Valley, but a surface find indicates the presence of Plano projectile
points with Cochise affinities.

The relationship of early man sites to geomorphic surfaces and late
Quaternary deposits of the valley is sufficiently well understood to guide
prospecting. Geological and archaeological investigations are continuing.

ANALYSIS OF A CLOVIS BISON KILL SITE AND PROCESSING AREA AT MURRAY

SPRINGS, SAN PEDRO VALLEY, ARIZONA |

During 1968 excavations at the Murray Springs site in southern
Arizona the concentrated remains of six extinct bison, five young cows
and a two year old of indeterminate sex, were encountered on a deeply
buried erosional unconformity or occupation surface, Associated with these :
remains were Clovis projectile points, edged tools, cobble hammers, a
, 23
zone of lithic debris, and two hearths. A radiocarbon determination of
11,230 + 340 years for a charcoal sample collected elsewhere on the site has
been geologically correlated with this occupation. Analysis of the
materials has proceeded by three stages. First, an assessment was made of
the loss, removal or disturbance of cultural debris by natural processes.
Next, each item of debris, including bison skeletal elements, tools,
lithic waste and other debris, and each feature were studied and
probable functions in on-site activities identified. Finally, with
precise distributional :data from excavations, the spatial relations of all
remaining and identifiable evidence, specific inferences were drawn about
the nature of localized cultural activities, Conclusions reached
through this analysis are important increments to knowledge of Paleo-
Indian subsistence ecology in these respects: (1) bison as well as
mammoths were efficiently exploited in pre-Folsom times in Arizona, (2)
multiple bison kills were achieved with selection of desirable animals,
(3) bison processing and associated technology are adduced with some
conficence as a result of preservation of context of cultural remains,
and (4) a high level of organization of the hunting unit is strongly
. implied.

DERIVATION OF PREHISTORIC MARRIAGE PATTERNS FROM ARCHAEOLOGICAL
EVIDENCE
Archaeological and ethnohistoric data pertinent to the historic
Missouri, Ioway and Oto tribal units is utilized in derivation of non-
technological cultural practices of these groups. Archaeological sites
identifiable as occupation places for the Missouri and Ioway tribes have been
isolated and the non-perishable remains are subjected to intensive
analysis. As a result of the analyses, some suggestions pertinent to
the suggested marriage patterns of these groups can be made with a fair
degree of confidence. Suggestions of preferred marriage patterning
among Chiwere-speaking peoples are discussed in terms of causal factors
and substantiating ethnological data,

ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE OF THE BELLA BELLA REGION, BRITISH
COLUMBIA
As a result of an initial season's survey, approximately 100
archaeological sites were located in the Bella Bella region of British

as salmon traps, petroglyph panels, pictograph panels, and burial caves. Test
excavations conducted in two of the middens suggest that cultural materials
are similar to those of the San Juan phase in the Puget Sound region. The
project is to continue for two additional years with a field school supported
by the University of Colorado and research funds provided by the National
Science Foundation.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE ARCHEOLOGY OF SOUTHERN TEXAS

In recent years, detailed studies of surface materials and other
archaeological data from most areas of southern Texas have been carried
out. Prior to this, the region had received only passing attention from
archeologists. Using the recent studies, some general concepts of the
area's prehistory can be formulated. It is apparent that an Archaic-
style lifeway existed in the region from Late Paleo-Indian times (or
earlier) until historic contact. In some areas, however, marked changes in
the cultural inventory may reflect some alteration of the subsistence
pattern in late prehistoric times. Much of the southern Texas coast
has not been adequately studied; however, in at least one region, it seems
that nomadic groups from the interior periodically visited the littoral
to exploit marine resources.
James N. Hill (University of California, Los Angeles)

PROBLEMS AND DATA: THE RELEVANCE OF OBSERVATIONS

It is often maintained that archaeologists should not allow their
research problems to govern the kinds of data they collect; they should
instead collect as much data as possible, in the hope that all data relevant
to subsequent analyses will be recovered. Otherwise, it is said,
valuable information may be overlooked and results will be biased, This
view is unrealistic and unworkable; efficient research requires not only
the prior formulation of problems, but also the formulation of specific
hypotheses or propositions (and a listing of the pertinent data to be
collected).

USES OF ETHNOHISTORICAL TECHNIQUES IN IDENTIFYING PONCA ARCHEOLOGICAL

SITES

&

During the past few years the speaker has assembled all available
materials bearing upon the location and description of known village
sites of the Ponca Indians. Five principal sources of information have
been utilized: standard published historical accounts; archival
materials; the J.0. Dorsey "Omaha" map; oral testimony gathered from
Ponca informants in connection with the Omaha land claims case in 1912
and 1914; and information secured by the speaker from Peter Le Claire,
the Ponca historian, and other Ponca informants. |

Thirty-one separate villages or camps were located in this manner, |
21 of which are named in either Degiha (the Indian language) or English.
Archaeological work has been done at five of the sites. At two of the |
sites this work has yielded materials of the Redbird focus, estimated to
date between 1600 and 1700 A.D., and materials at two others are not
, 25

inconsistent with a Redbird Focus identification. The fact that two
Redbird Focus sites have been independently identified as long-standing
villages of the Ponca tribe, with associated native names and traditions,
together with other data on Ponca village locations and dates, tends
to confirm the identification of the Redbird Focus as the
archaeological remains of the Ponca Indians. It is suggested that
rigorous ethnohistorical research of a similar nature might shed light on
the tribal affiliation of other late prehistoric or early historic
archaeological manifestations in this and other parts of North America.

EXPERIMENTS IN THE THERMAL TREATMENT OF FINE GRAINED SILICEOUS

MATERIALS

Experiments in flint knapping and independent analyses of
archaeological materials have established that some considerable proportion
of prehistoric chipped stone objects were thermally treated prior to manufacture.
New evidence concerning this problem is now available through experimentation
to determine the nature of the physical-chemical alterations responsible
for the observed changes in heated material. The two kinds of
experiments conducted involve 1) a determination of weight loss through
water loss and concomitant change in absolute hardness; 2) an
examination of possible micro-crystalline alteration through X-ray
microscopy. The results of these experiments are outlined and the known
occurrence of heat treated materials in prehistoric sites in the United
States is discussed.

THE 1967 MIMBRES VALLEY SURVEY: PRELIMINARY RESULTS

From January to May of 1967 a survey was conducted in the Mimbres
Valley and adjacent areas of Southwestern New Mexico. Collections were
made from about 330 sites, including 20 previously reported in the site file
of the New Mexico Laboratory of Anthropology. About 200 of the sites
, 26

discovered by the survey yielded samples in excess of 200 sherds and appear
to represent relatively permanent campsites or villages.

At least four ceramic phases are represented in the collections,
each with particular settlement patterns and distributions. In general,
it appears that the highest elevations in the Mimbres area were abandoned
earliest and latest settlement was confined to a few consolidated
villages in the southernmost reaches of the Mimbres drainage. More
detailed results of the analysis of these distributions and the temporal
and geographical distribution of ceramic types are presented in this paper.

CULTURAL CONTINUITY IN EASTERN KANSAS

Data derived from recent archaeological investigations in eastern
Kansas suggest a hypothesis to explain certain aspects of the human
occupation of this Prairie-Plains border region during the ceramic ‘
period. Initial ceramic-bearing cultures , labelled Kansas City
Hopewell, seem to represent a western movement from the Illinois River
valley, which began about the time of Christ. The Kansas City Hopewell
complex apparently coesixted with local Archaic complexes until approximately
A.D. 500, Recognizable Kansas City Hopewell occupation ended at about
A.D. 500 as a result of a southward movement of Plains Woodland groups,
which resulted in a cultural syncretism of Hopewell: and Woodland elements.
A localized development of the Central Plains tradition, divisible into
two periods, developed from the Hopewell-Woodland syncretism.

LATE QUATERNARY COASTAL EOLIANITES AND PALEOSOLS: AN

ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND PALEOENVIRONMENTAL APPRATSAL

Interdisciplinary studies of Late Quaternary coastal eolianites and
their contained paleosols often yield valuable archaeological and paleo-
environmental information. Artifactual and other human evidences are
common in coastal eolianites which function as natural sedimentary traps.

Reconstruction of past environments is made possible by 1) presence of
micro-and macrofossils such as pollen, fossil vegetation and peat, mammalian
and other vertebrate remains; and 2) eolian cross-stratification and other
sedimentological features. Evidence of sea level changes is shown by
eolianites and paleosols submerged below present sea level.

Coastal eolianites and paleosols are concentrated in Australia,
South Africa, and the Mediterranean, but also occur along the Persian Gulf
and Atlantic Moroccan coast, as well as on such islands as Madagascar, the
West Indies, Bermuda, the Hawaiian group, and the insular parts of southern
California.

EVIDENCE FOR KATUN WORSHIP AT THE CLASSIC MAYA SITE OF TIKAL, GUATEMALA

In 1963, the author conducted a five-month program of excavation in
the "twin-pyramid Groups" in the Classic Maya site of Tikal in Guatemala.
There are some suggestions in the form and dating of these groups that
they housed ceremonies of worship directed to the gods of the 13 Katuns.
A katun is the Maya period of twenty 360-day years. In Tikal, a new twin-
pyramid group was built every katun for six consecutive katunms during the Late
Classic. At least two of the groups were destroyed or transformed during
the Late Classic. Thus it is likely that use of the groups shifted from
old to new group every katun, similar to the practice of katun-god

; worship reported in the 16th Century Yucatan by Bishop Landa. Furthermore,

the names of the katuns (the period-ending days) are emphasized in the
hieroglyphic inscriptions of the groups. Concerns with the four world
directions and with ritual numbers also appear in the twin-pyramid groups
and in the later practices. It would appear that katun worship was as
important to the cohesiveness and welfare of the commmity of Tikal as it
was to the 16th Century Yucatecans.

CERAMICS, CULTS, AND CULTURE CHANGE IN CHALCHIHUITES CULTURE

We now have fairly complete records of ceramic types and the
changing decorative styles represented for more than a thousand years of
the cultural development known as the Chalchihuites Culture in Zacatecas
and Durango, Mexico. Throughout much of this period decorative designs
Clearly reflect Mesoamerican ceremonial concepts, and hence appear to
represent religious cults. A detailed period by period study of shifts in
design, decorative technique, vessel form, and apparent cult
representations yields a significant insight into the mechanisms of
cultural change involved.

POLLEN ANALYSIS OF HUMAN COPROLITES AND CAVE FILL, HOGUP CAVE, UTAH

Conditions within Hogup Cave were favorable for the preservation of
pollen. Coprolites and cave fill samples from the major stratigraphic
units were analyzed for pollen. Most were dominated by pollen of
Chenopodiaceae. Pollen percentages of other probable economic plants
indicate varying use of secondary resources centered around a generally
stable subsistence pattern that emphasized the Chenopodiaceae throughout
most of the time of cave occupation. The pollen data is in agreement
with plant macrofossils from cave fill and coprolites which indicate
extensive utilization of pickleweed (Allenrolfea occidentalis),

ANARANJADA DELGADA AT TBOTIHUACAN

Anaranjada Delgada (Thin Orange) pottery, a major ceramic ware of
the Classic Period Found in the highlands of Mesoamerica, has received
considerable attention in the literature (Linne 1942; Armillas 1944;
Kidder, Jennings and Shook 1946; Tolstoy 1958, etc.) Typological
analysis of extensive collections, derived from excavations and surface
survey in the Teotihuacan Valley, have resulted in the ability of internally
phase the ware in regard to paste, color, form and decoration (methods
and motifs). Technological studies have suggested that Thin Orange is
not entirely a trade ware from south-central or eastern Puebla, and that
much of it was produced locally at Teotihuacan.

LITHIC TRADITIONS IN THE PLEISTOCENE OF SOUTH AMERICA

At least seven different technological/typological traditions can
be recognized in the Pleistocene lithic assemblages of South America. They
have different temporal and spatial distributions and, in all probability,
different origins. The four earliest traditions often occur in pure form
and probably originated as discrete industries brought into the continent
by different groups of migrants. Characterized by their dominant artifacts,
they are:

1. Edge-retouched: Peru and Chile;stratigraphically beneath biface

tradition in Peru,

2. Burin: Ecuador, Peru and Chile.

3. Biface: Andean, Venezuela to Chile and Argentina; beginning ca.
14,000 B.P. in Venezuela, ending ca. 10,000 B.P. in Peru.

4. Side Scraper: eastern, Venezuela and Patagonia; present before
11,000 B.P.; intrusive into Andean regions in post-Pleistocene
times.

Although North American and perhaps Asiatic origins can be suggested
for these early traditions, reasonable antecedents are known so far only
for the biface tradition, and these are not adequately dated either in
North America or in northern China.

The three later traditions are found only in various combinations
with each other and with derived elements of the earlier traditions. All
of them can be dated to the very end of the Pleistocene, probably after
ca. 11,000 B.P. Two of them (again named for their dominant artifacts)
have clear cut North American antecedents:

5. Ribbon-flaked projectile point: Venezuela, possibly extending to

Ecuador,

6. Fluted point: eastern, Panama, Brazil to Patagonia, with post-
Pleistocene intrusions into Andean regions.

The remaining tradition (7, blade) has numerous Old World convergences,

but was probably indigenous to northern Chile, whence it spread briefly
to Peru and Argentina in terminal Pleistocene times,

THE TRANSMISSION OF SHIPIBO-CONIBO ART STYLE: STYLISTIC SIMILARITY

AND THE STRUCTURE OF HOUSEHOLDS

The extended family is a clearly recognized social unit among the
Shipibo-Conibo of the tropical forest of eastern Peru. The make-up
of such families is variable, and a mmber of general principles must be
invoked to explain their adhesion, growth, and dissolution. The degree
to which the ceramics produced within such extended families are stylistically
similar is also highly variable. An examination of the ceramic production
of a number of such families suggests that the co-residence of biological

sisters may lead to a high degree of stylistic uniformity. It is doubtful
if these Shae factors would have been hypothesized in the absence of
detailed ethnographic data. The question is raised whether any
archaeological analysis of stylistic variation is a sufficient basis
for an adequate model of a defunct society.

BUFFALO AND BEANS-CULTURAL ECOLOGY OF THE PLAINS VILLAGE TRIBES

The Mandan and Hidatsa serve to illustrate the fact that the Plains
village tribes developed a unique native American ecosystem. These
groups were sedentary horticulturalists, and there is reliable evidence
that their economy depended heavily on the produce of their gardens. There
is equally good evidence that it depended at least as heavily on hunting
big game animals, particularly the bison. The dual reliance on
cultivated plants and large animals, which was developed as early as A.D.
900, cannot be duplicated anywhere else in aboriginal North America. It
is, however, analogous to the agricultural-pastoral economies of the
Old World.

The Missouri River trench is an ecological niche which was the
primary focus of Mandan and Hidatsa culture. Archaeology and ethnohistory
show that the villages themselves were located there. The flood plain
was the only zone of cultivation, and the wooded bottom lands were the
main source of timber. The river provided water, driftwood, carcasses of
drowned bison, fish, and probably some shellfish. Uncleared bottom lands
were a source of woodland game animals.

The grasslands, which stretch vast distances from both lips of the
Missouri trench, were a heavily exploited hinterland. They provided the
bison and antelope which were essential for food and for raw materials
such as hides, sinew, and bones which were fashioned into artifacts.
Secondary geological deposits outside the trench seem to have provided most
of the stone for tool making.

The Mandan-Hidatsa resource base was an extremely rich one in most
respects, and the native technology was adequate fer exploiting it in
both prehistoric and historic times. Archaeo-demographic studies suggest
, 30
however, that the total population never approached the apparent
carrying capacity of the environment. The explanation for this is
still a matter for speculation, but possible causes may include minor
changes in a marginal climatic situation, local exhaustion of a crucial
resource such as timber, or one of several socio-political factors.

THE CHRONOLOGY AND CONTENT OF A LATE PINEDALE (WISCONSIN) ARTIFACT

ASSEMBLAGE FROM THE GRANITE POINT LOCALITY, WASHINGTON

Excavations at the Granite Point Locality (45WT41) produced an
assemblage of 412 artifacts which are contemporaneous with the last
deposition of gravel on the middle bar of the Snake River bar sequence.

The middle period of bar formation is considered to be of Late Pinedale
(Wisconsin) age, and is dated approximately between 9,000 and 13,000 years
ago. The cultural material is probably no more than 10,000 years old and

is conservatively estimated to be about 9,000 years old. Age estimates based
on geologic and archaeologic comparisons conflict with a single radiocarbon
date of 14,000 + 1160 B.P. Several lines of evidence suggest that the
radiocarbon date is too old.

The artifact assemblage is characterized by a variety of stemmed
projectile points, some lanceolate projectile points, large knife-like
implements, burins, prismatic blades and abundant utilized flakes. Rone
implements are not numerous, but include atlatl spurs. Lithic technology
and some artifacts suggest a degree of relationship with the Lind Coulee
assemblages. The associated fauna includes only elk and rabbit.

EXCAVATIONS AT THE ENGLEBERT SITE, SOUTH CENTRAL NEW YORK

Highway salvage excavations were carried out during the summers of 1967
and 1968 qt the Englebert Site, a large, multi-component Archaic and Late
Woodland site located on the Upper Susquehanna River near the southern
boundary of New York State. The Archaic occupation is referable to the
Lamoka culture; the Late Woodland occupation appears to consist of
late @wasco, prehistoric Iroquois, and early historic Susquehannock
components. The most striking characteristic of the site was the large
number of human burials, all of the Late Woodland period. Remains of
approximately 140 individuals were recovered. In addition, over 500
Late Woodland pit features were excavated and a predominantly Owasco hillside
midden trenched. The skeletal material is being analyzed by Dr. Audrey
Sublett of Florida Atlantic Universaty; the cultural materials are under
study in the archaeology laboratories of State University of New York at
Binghamton.

SPECULATIONS ON THULE CULTURE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE

The development of Thule culture in the Canadian Arctic is seen as a
series of responses to changing environmental conditions. It is suggested
that an ameliorating climate at approximately 1000 A.D. was reflected in
changes in the seasonal distribution of sea ice and of sea mammals. Changes
in hunting patterns, developed in response to these new conditions, may
define the beginning of Thule culture and may have promoted the movement of
Thule people eastward from North Alaska. Specialized regional variants of
Canadian Thule culture are separated by environmental boundaries. The
development of these regional variants of Thule culture into the regional
tribes of historic Eskimo is in accord with varied responses to a harsher
climatic regime which culminated between the 17th and 19th centuries,

AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY - 1865-1900

During the third of a century following the Civil War, there was
a remarkable increase in archaeotogical activity in the United States.

This activity was sponsored by several agencies of the U.S. government,

rare private institutions and dozens of historical and scientific societies.
This period withessed the founding of the Bureau of Ethnology, the Peabody
Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, the American Antiquarian and Oriental
Journal, the Washington Anthropological Society and its offspring, the American
Anthropological Society and its journal.

Although the eastern half of the United States received the overwhelming :
portion of archaeological research during this period-mainly based on
attempts to identify the makers of the widespread earthworks, the 1870's
and the 1880's saw the beginnings of archaeological investigation in the
Far West and in Alaska. The germinal questions concerning the origins
of the American Indians, the identity of the Mound-builders, the age of
man in the New World, the New World "paleolithic", prehistoric technology,
and socio-cultural implications of prehistoric architecture, settlement and
burial patterns were being pursued.

Knowledge of the discoveries of European prehistorians related in such
publications as the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution and
the American Antiquarian stimulated the search for fossil man and his
cultures, and other parallels in prehistoric development. Concepts and
approaches such as the culture area, ethnographic analogy, cultural
ecology, and historical linguistics began to be employed in archaeologically-
based reconstructions while at the same time archaeological field techniques
remained very primitive.

In spite of the antiquarian and salvage nature of much of American
archaeology in the latter one-third of the nineteenth century, it formed
the major part of the discipline from which the Golden Age of American
Anthropology emerged.

MARSHES ON THE DESERT: POST PLUVIAL HISTORY OF WATER AVAILABILITY,

HOGUP CAVE, UTAH

The only known permanent water supply for Hogup Cave is a nearby
spring that feeds a small salt marsh. The distribution of salt marsh
species reflects water quantity and quality. Pollen and seed analysis of
cores from the Hogup Spring salt marsh give a history of species distribution
patterns, allowing inferences about the past water availability.

The results of these analyses and their relations to human occupation and
subsistence patterns and to the post-pluvial climatic history of the Great
Salt Lake area will be discussed.

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF AGE, SEX, AND TIME OF BURIAL IN THE

INTERPRETATION OF THULE ESKIMO BURIAL PATTERNS

Excavations at Five sites in the northwest comer of ltudson Bay,
but concentrating upon the two large villages of Silumiut and Kamarvik,
produced data on 336 Eskimo burials, the great majority of these
representing the Thule culture of Arctic Canada. (The first 105 of these
burials were excavated in 1967 and described at the SAA Meeting in 1968) .
The position of the rising sun on the day of burial was found to play

. an important role in the orientation of the dead and several features

associated with this role were identified. The age and sex of the
deceased were also found to affect orientation and regional variations
in patterning were noted along more than 250 miles of Roes Welcome
Sound coastline.

Situated on the edge of the Eastern Cordillera in the transition
zone between the extreme northern interior plains and the MacKenzie
lowlands, the Fisherman Lake area has provided a sequence of twelve cultural
complexes extending from the late Pleistocene to the present. The
earliest two complexes , Hughes and McLeod, are each defined from single
excavated components with geological provenience of considerable
antiquity. The artifact samples, while relatively small, can be compared

PLASTER SCULPTURES AT LAMBITYECO, OAXACA

Although modelled clay and plaster had been used as architectural
decorations in Oaxaca at least since the times of Monte Alban I, only
fragmentary examples had been found. In late 1968 several examples were
discovered at Lambityeco that show, in addition to artistic merit,
iconographically novel elements. They contribute also to the scanty
body of calendric inscriptions in the Monte Alhan tradition, and their state
of preservation is good to excellent in most cases. In the opinion of
Alfonso Caso they constitute an addition of the utmost importance to
knowledge of art, architecture, and calendrics in the Monte Alban tradition.

ASYMMETRY: A MAYAN ARCHITECTURE PLANNED MEMORY DEVICE AT UXMAL

The "Cementerio" section of the Archaeological Zone at Uxmal,
Yucatan, Mexico contains a stela-like stone monument with a feature
that is unusual and strikingly different from any observed in the
Yucatan home of the ancient Maya Indians. Research, and conversations
with the chief archaeologist of the zone reveal that, along with its
uniqueness, the position it occupies bears a relationship to the
positions occupied by the uncovered tzompantli, and round columns.
These constructions, so familiar to the Maya, are so oriented about the
major and minor axis of the sector as to suggest a deliberate conceptualization
of disarrangement by the architect for a telling and lasting purpose.

THE ACASTA LAKE SITE, N.W.T., CANADA

Located 80 miles SE of Port Radium, Great Bear Lake, the Acasta
Lake site (LiPk-1) has yielded a rich assemblage of early northern
Plano artifacts. Early point types from the site have previously been
described by Dr. R.G. Porbis (1961). Full-scale excavation of the site this
past summer revealed that it had been a major quarry locale as well as a
sizeable habitation. Over an area of 850 excavated square feet, 105 buried
hearths were recorded. The site is homogenous, yet has been reoccupied
by the same group. A carbon date of 5020 B.C. has been obtained from

| one of the hearths, and marks one of the earliest Indian penetrations
into the central sub-arctic region of MacKenzie District.

VALLEY FOCUS MORTUARY PRACTICES

Valley Focus is a Plains Woodland manifestation located in Kansas and
Nebraska. Taylor Mound, a site overlooking the Missouri River about
five miles south of White Cloud, Kansas, is a product of this culture and
gives us important data on the burial practices of these people.

The mound was about 80 feet in diameter and located about 10 feet
south of the E-W center axis laying on the original ground line was a
limestone slab stone cist into which were placed the bundled remains of at
least eight individuals. The cist was ca. 3 x 7 feet and was oriented on a
N-S axis. The remains consist basically of long bones and skulls. The
skulls formed two rows running N-S, on the west side were three and on the
east side of the cist were four, but one of that four was deeper and under
the NE most skull so that when excavated it looked at first as if there were
two rows of three each. Placed between the rows of skulls were three bundles of
long bones resulting in a laddered effect of skulls and long hones. On the
central long bone bundle was the eighth skull; it was facing north
and just in front of it was a greenstone celt (the only grave good).

Ceramics from the fill of the mound indicate this burial complex is
Valley Focus in affiliation. There was also some evidence that the top
fill of the mound had been used by Nebraska culture people, but much of that
data was apparently destroyed by relic hunters over 50 years ago.

ARMOR IN COLONIAL AMERICA

Body armor of various types was in use by explorers to the New World
from the landing of Columbus , through the Spanish explorations of the
southeastern and southwestern United States. Armor was also brought to
this hemisphere by the English colonists who settled the eastern coast,
Very little identifyable material has been recovered to date from
archaeological sites. This is due, in part, to the types of armor used.
The various kinds of armor are illustrated and discussed as well as the

QAXACA AFTER MONTE ALBAN: SOME NEW DATA

By definition, Monte Alban IV is a period whose nature cannot be
defined through work at Monte Alban itself; it is the survival of the
Monte Alban tradition elsewhere after the abandonment of the capital. After
years of fruitless search, we have found at Lambityeco a site that serves
to define plainly what seems to be early Monte Alban IV, and we have 5
radiocarbon dates placing it around A.D. 700. There is close correspondence
with other dates from other Oaxaca Valley sites, dated in other laboratories
and derived from materials excavated by other workers, but highly similar
to the Lambityeco remains. Occurrence of Balancan Fine Orange pottery, |
as well as greca decorations in architecture, suggests contemporaneity
with Puuc Maya; and we are confronted with the same phenomenon observed
by Andrews for Dzibilchaltun, Uxmal, Palenque, and the Puuc sections of
Chichen Itza; Puuc seems to be 2 or 3 centuries earler than we thought
it was, There are some connections with the Valley of Mexico also, and
important implications for the Monte Alban sequence and for the late
florescence in Oaxaca that followed (in Monte Alban V) the decadence
of Monte Alban IV.

This paper is an attempt to relate a large body of archaeological

basic validity and utility of this important ethnohistoric source; b) to
elucidate the main cultural processes of the Early Postclassic period
(ca 700-1100 A.D.) by means of a synthesis of complementary ethnohistoric
and archaeological information; and c) by extrapolation to a more general
level, to suggest new perspectives on the type and quality of information
that Mesoamerican ethnohistoric sources can most reasonably be expected to
provide fer students of prehispanic social organization.

WINNEBAGO CULTURAL ADAPTATION TO THE FOX RIVER WATERWAY

Lake Winnebago Focus site distributions indicate a primary adaptation
to the Fox River Valley in terms of their subsistence economy. A high regional
density of waterfowl, fish, deer, and wild rice was critical to the subsistence
base of the Winnebago. In addition to the native flora and fauna, corn
agriculture flourished in this environmental setting. The application of
Mississippian technological innovations to this environment led to
a regional cultural dominance in relationship to neighboring Woodland
tribes.

In addition to a more productive food technology, the Winnebagos

. controlled an important transportation route for the flow of regional

products between various tribes. They may have benefited economically
from trading with adjacent tribes who exploited different environments.

FROM BASKETMAKER TO PUEBLO: A PROCESSUAL ANALYSIS

The transition from Basketmaker to Pueblo culture in the prehistoric
Southwest was defined in detail and explained by A.V. Kidder. Kidder's
successors have given primary attention to increasing the detail of his
definition and to defining the temporal boundaries of his stages. The
fundamental explanation for the transition is still Kidder's. Recent works
have focused attention on the role of ecological variables in the transition
and on its fundamentally economic nature. The paper presents an explanation
for the transition in terms of economic and ecological variables. A
processual model based upon historic cases of economic growth is shown to
account for many generalized aspects of the transition as well as the
original trait changes that Kidder detailed.

AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO THE FUNCTION OF CLASSIC MAYA CHULTUNS

Mayanists have long speculated on the function of subterranean
chambers called chultuns, constructed by the Classic Maya. Consideration of
the chambered variety, found only in certain parts of the deeply forested
portions of the southern Lowlands, has produced a number of alternative
hypotheses. Experimentation, as a technique, has proved to be an
invaluable supplement to excavation data for hypothesis testing. It has lead
to the rejection of most of the alternatives, including water storage,
and the confirmation of only one- the storage of the farinaceous seed of the
Tamon tree.

THE CERAMIC SBQUENCE AT TRINIDAD, TABASCO

Excavations were conducted at Trinidad, Tabasco, on the lower
Usumacinta River near Emiliano Zapata, in the course of a ceramic survey of
the Palenque region. Although Trinidad lies only 30 miles from Palenque,
ceramic patterns are notably different, usually having stronger affiliations
with pottery from the Peten and other more centrally-located portions of the
Maya lowlands than with Palenque. A pit over five meters in depth provided
mojor stratigraphic information at Trinidad. Four Preclassic ceramic
complexes are recognized, three from the Classic period, and one from the
Early Postclassic, These complexes are represented in varying
strength in the Trinidad materials, Middle Preclassic and Late Classic
pottery being most abundant. The rise of fine-paste cream, black and
gray wares, in times equivalent to Tepeu 2, is a particularly notable
development, Unlike the situation in the Peten or at sites up the
Usumacinta drainage such as Piedras Negras, Altar and Seibal, the fine paste
developments are rooted stylistically in the Tepeu polychrome tradition.
However, rapid cultural changes toward the close of the Classic period
brought about the emergence of localized styles having a basically
Western Maya rather than a Peten Maya orientation.

Late Intermediate Period occupation sites are fortified along the

| SYSTEMATIC INTENSIVE SURFACE COLLECTION AS A MEANS OF GENERATING

ARCHAEOLOGICAL HYPOTHESES

Archaeologists would agree that the cultural debris lying on
the surface of a site in some way reflects what is buried below.
However, few attempts have been made to discover just how closely one can
predict from detailed knowledge of surface distributions what he will
find if he digs.

In October-November, 1968, surface collections based on statistical
sampling techniques were made by the Prehistoric Project, Istanbul-
Chicago, at two mounds near Diyarbakir, Turkey. The tabulated data were
put into the form of contour maps. We found that study of these maps--
singly or in combination as overlays-- immediately suggested numerous
hypotheses which could be formulated much more precisely than those
derived from the usual intuitive method based on simple inspection
of the site surface. Soundings were made to test some of these major
hypotheses. The results of the soundings plus subsequent
statistical analyses suggest that intensive, systematic surface
collection can be an extremely useful technique not only for determining
where to dig, but also for generating highly provocative hypotheses
relevant to the total interpretation of the site.

PHYTOGEOGRAPHY AS A SURVEY TECHNIQUE IN WISCONSIN

During the spring and summer of 1966, in the course of implementing
a program of archaeological pollen analysis, a body of data was collected
regarding plant associations at archaeological sites in north-central
Wisconsin. Analysis of the results indicates that the character of the components
at a site correlate with the character of the existing vegetation to a
remarkable degree, Further survey work in the area may thus be aided by
comprehension of the vegetation, with predictions being made about
where sites will be found and the probable components to be recovered

' at sites supporting certain forms of forest growth. Given certain

cultural assumptions, it is also possible to use this data to justify
paleoecological hypotheses of relevance to culture historical
reconstruction. These hypotheses may later be tested by techniques of
paleoecological research.

guides to archaeological data collection and inferences. This paper
briefly reviews several of these consequences: reasons for movement,
total community configuration, economics, technology, social organization,
and religion. This material is then examined as a base for the development
of an archaeological research design related to cases of prehistoric

types as they relate to archaeological inference are discussed.

PRELIMINARY REPORT: CALICO MOUNTAINS ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT

Since November, 1964, archaeological excavations have been conducted in
a Pleistocene alluvial fan extending eastward into Lake Manix Basin from
the Calico Mountains in the Mojave Desert of California. These excavations
are conducted under sponsorship of the San Bernadino County Museum, and
under the direction of Dr. L.S.B. Leakey,

Two major pits have been excavated into the early building period
of the fan. Average depths currently are 15' and 25'. From these pits
both tools and significant technical flakes have been recovered at depth.
That these specimens are man made is accepted by those in charge of the
, 42

project and by numerous visiting scientists. However, some scientists
still feel unable to accept the specimens as evidence of human activity.

The lithic assemblage is primitive in appearance and character, as
would be expected in view of the probable antiquity of the locality.
Geologists and geomorphologists agree with Project Geologist Dr. Thomas
Clements that the age of the alluvial fan and the specimens it contains is
at least 40,000 years old, based on studies carried out to date.

excavation at the Sam Kaufman site which is located on the Red River in
Texas uncovered evidence of the hanging on of the Cult until about A.D.
1500’%on the northwestern periphery of the Caddoan area. The evidence from the
site includes a circular shaft burial pit containing eleven individuals
with associated artifacts which form a pattern similar to that previously
recorded and attributed to the Southern Cult in adjacent areas, The
presence of this late holding on of the Cult will be related to
activity in surrounding areas and to the Caddoan way of life.

Southwest between A.D. 1050 and 1400. Although archaeologists have
suggested a number of hypotheses concerning the causes of this event, there
is a considerable debate about what is the primary cause. The
difficulty seems to be methodological. The hypotheses have also not been
tested sufficiently to determine their validity. Several archaeologists
have recently proposed a deductive procedure for the testing of alternative
hypotheses, Applied to the problem of abandonment, this procedure
yields much more positive results than was previously possible. It
supports the hypothesis that abandonment was an adaptation to a minor change
in physical environment.

A MIDDLE WOODLAND SITE ON THE COAST OF MAINE

The Grindle Site offered an unusual combination of characteristics
for a Maine site. It is not located directly on the coast, but rather
on the shore of a salt water pond about one and one half miles from
where salt water rushes in and out of the pond with the tides. The site has
some of the characteristics of inland Maine sites, and although it is not
, 43
a shell midden, a relatively high clamshell content has counteracted
a normally high acidity of the soil and has permitted the preservation
of ordinarily perishable artifacts. Maine Prehistory is complicated by
a number of local micro-environments, particularly along the coast, The
prehistoric occupation of the Grindle Site appears to have been
influenced by relatively minor sea level fluctuations in addition to
changing techniques of economic exploitation. Findings at this site have
significance for the interpretation of other sites in northern New
England and the Maritimes.

MISSISSIPPIAN EXPANSION INTO THE SAGINAW VALLEY, MICHIGAN

The presence of shell-temperad ceramics has long been known in the
Valley, and in 1952, Quimby writes; "Surface collections from sites in the
Saginaw Valley of eastern Michigan have revealed the presence of shell-
tempered pottery decorated in several ways... I suspect that this
pottery shows relationships with the types found along the Mississippi
and west of the Mississippi.'' Recent excavations, and surface collections,
in the Saginaw valley, Michigan have brought to light the presence of
a large number of Mississippi related sites.

This paper will deal with several of these sites with respect to
size, ceramics, lithic industry, and relationships, both inter and
intra-Valley. The most important of the sites discussed will be the
Malone Site, Michigan. This site suggests an agricultural village of
perhaps 30 to 50 acres in size. There is one C 14 date of A.D.

1410 + 100 for the Oneota-like component which is well represented at this
site.

RECENT EXCAVATIONS NEAR POINT BARROW ALASKA AND THEIR SIGNIFICANCE

ON ESKIMO PREHISTORY

Archaeological investigations at the site of Walakpa during the summer
of 1968 revealed a stratigraphic continuum spanning from Arctic Small Tool
Tradition to Modern Eskimo. The earliest known Walakpa level contains an
assemblage which may be transitional hetween Denbigh and Choris cultures.
Artifacts and other remains from this level included perishable materials
and characteristic burins, microblades, along with other micro-tools.

The stratigraphic occurrence of Birnirk-Eastern Thule, Western Thule leads
to speculation on the origins of modern Eskimo culture,

HOPI TEWA POTTERY MAKING: STYLES OF LEARNING

This paper presents data from a preliminary study of Hopi- Tewa
pottery making which attempts to analyze some of the factors of
transmission and learning of a pottery style, and their correlation with
social organization units of the society. The Hopi and Hopi-Tewa
potters interviewed were those who make a white-slipped pottery which
is comparatively rare, of relatively recent origin, and easily distinguished
from other Hope wares. Manufacturing techniques are briefly discussed; and
also methods of teaching, and choice of pupils.

First season interviews allow us to trace the style from about 1920,
at which time whiteware was produced by at least two related Hopi-Tewa
women (one of the Bear clan, and one of the Kachina clan), who
worked together. Descendants of the Kachina clan woman are now recognized as the
outstanding potters of this style, and they are teaching both their
consanguinial and affinal relatives, including members of at least three
Hopi-Tewa clans, and one or more Hopi clans. Thus one pottery style may
be manufactured by Hopi and Hopi-Tewa women of four to five clans, the
women living in Keams Canyon, Polacca, and three villages on First
Mesa (Hano, Sichomovi, and Walpi). Among the modern Hopi-Tewa, then, a
pottery style is not limited to members of a single clan or lineage, nor
manufactured in but one village or locality.

PREHISTORIC MAHAMAES CULTIVATION IN THE VIRU' VALLEY, PERU

Recent interest has been focused on the initiation and utilization
of sunken cultivation plots (pukios or mahamaes)in certain Peruvian
coastal valleys during the iran storic period. Several viewpoints have
indicated that technological problems or difficulties arising out of
the maximum utilization of available land and water resources were
responsible for the adoption of this new technique by the inhabitants of
the Viru' Valley. This present analysis suggests that the appearance of
mahamaes cultivation during the Middle Horizon in the Viru' Valley can he
understood within a framework implied by the concept of the ecosystem
and emphasizing certain aspects of social dynamics.

FUNCTIONAL ANALYSES OF LATE WOODLAND PERISHABLE ARTIFACTS

Perishable artifact remains in the Northeastern United States are
primarily limited, except for rare instances, to bone and antler
implements. Since many of the lifeways of prehistoric peoples can be
interpreted only through perishable remains, it is critical for
ethnohistory that these artifacts be carefully studied to determine their
utilization within the total culture pattern. This paper evaluates the
methods that can be employed in analysing perishable artifacts, such as
cordage, leather, and wood, as well as hone, in order to arrive at a
greater understanding of their cultural implications. The methodology
hopefully will result in a more complete ethnohistoric reconstruction of
prehistoric populations.

PALEOANTHROPOLOGY OF THE LINDENMEIER SITE

Current analyses of collections from the Lindenmeier Site are
yielding results which permit statements about the probable nature of
Paleo-Indian sociocultural life to be made, Occupation was repeated,
probably on a seasonal basis. Stratigraphic separation of components
is clear. There appears to have been, in each case, simultaneous
occupation by at least two distinct social units. Analysis of the
lithic assemblages associated with these social units is discussed.
Activity specific areas are delineated and variations in stylistic and

SOUTHWESTERN ALASKAN CROSSTIES WITH THE BERING SEA REGION

Archaeological cultures of three different technological traditions
occupied contiguous areas in southwestern Alaska throughout much of the
millennium on either side of A.D, 1. Two of these, the Cachemak tradition
of the Gulf of Alaska and a technology characteristic of the western
Alaska Peninsula-eastern Aleutians, are indigenous to the ice-free
North Pacific Ocean, while the third, represented by material from the
Bering Sea shore at the base of the Alaska Peninsula, is related to the Norton
culture of more northerly provenience.

A recently completed study of a large number of artifacts from the small
North Pacific island of Chirikof documented the presence of a number of
distinctive artifact types which occur hoth north and south of the Alaska
Peninsula in several or all of the cultural contexts enumerated above. These
types are regarded, insofar as a shaky and emergent chronology permits, as
markers indicative of culturally significant connections between these
basically different cultural spheres. In this paper I will present
evidence for the occurrence of some of the more important and
distinctive of these types. Existence of these long-standing connections
between cultural provinces, and across ecological barriers are seen as
significant for our understanding of the prehistory of southwestern Alaska
during the second millennium A.D, when the Bering Sea influences were
intensified in the greater Kodiak area.

OJIBWA CULTURE HISTORY ALONG THE NORTH SHORE OF THE UPPER GREAT LAKES

The application of the direct historical approach to some of the
Ojibwa bands along the north shore of the Upper Great Lakes has been successful
in tracing regional culture histories back as far as the 10th century. In
order to give meaning to these archaeological sequences, however, it has been
necessary to rely upon inferences concerning social structure, subsistence,
and settlement pattern. Although the data are far from adequate, a picture
is emerging of small, local, conservative bands gradually developing over
a considerable period of time into the historic Algonkian-speakers of the region.
Throughout these developments culture change appears to have been very slow
despite continuous, although spatially variable influences from outside.

TWO LATE TOMBS AND OTHER RECENT DISCOVERIES AT CHINKULTIC,CHIAPAS ,MEXICO
Preliminary excavations at Chinkultic,Chiapas, Mexico, by the BYU New
World Archaeological Foundation, cooperating with the Milwaukee Public Museun,

have exposed details of an imposing ceremonial complex. One of the major
constructions is a so-called temple at the summit of ah-180 feet high
terraced platform overlooking the 'Blue Cenote' investigated hy the
Milwaukee Public Museum.

Discoveries to date include two tombs, one belonging to the Late
Classic and the other to the Early Postclassic periods. They are thought
to represent the ultimate architectural stages of the site. The discovery
of Late Preclassic or Protoclassic stelae fragments and abundant early
potsherds suggest however that earlier architecture will also be foun-.

MEDIA LUNA CAVE: A LATE PRECLASSIC SITE IN CHIAPAS, MEXICO

Explorations made during March and May of 1968 in a large dry limestone
rockshelter in the Rio La Venta of Chiapas, resulted in a discovery of a
small terraced masonry pyramidal platform with a multi-room wattle and daub
superstructure.

Offerings were excavated containing whole vessels, folded palm boot nads,
copal balls and what is apparently human hair.in front of and to one side
of the masonry platform. Small palm-boot wrapped offerings associated with
three burials contained small copal balls,small lengths of cord, beans,
squash and a small quantity of very small spherical seeds.

Several small pieces of textiles, many knotted cords and a few pieces of
woven palm mats are only some of the many artifacts of perishable material
recovered.

Pottery evidence inside the platform, of Chiapa IV types (450-250B.C.),
is thought to date the construction of this structure, while a large burnt
cache of several hundred pottery vessels of Chiapa V-VI types (200 B.C.)
stacked against the side of the platform and in front of the burials
effectively mark the end of the most intensive occupation of the rockshelter.

POTTERY MAKING, RESIDENCE AND "DESCENT'' IN AN EXTENDED FAMILY OF

POTTERS IN TICUL, YUCATAN

Genealogical and residence data of five generations of an extended
family of potters in Ticul,Yucatan, Mexico are examined, These data
reveal that pottery making is learned within the household unit. Both men
and women are potters and they learn the skill within their natal
households (from either or both parents) or within the respective house-
holds into which they marry. A study of the residence data reveals that
the households of potters are localized in a relatively small area within
the city; the residences of the extended family under consideration also |
tend to occur together within this area. It appears then, that the
learning of pottery making and the post-nuptial residential choices of
potters are both influenced by kinship (cognatically and affinally
defined in this case), but not determined by any simplistic system of
‘descent' such as the -four-fold classification of patrilineal, matrilineal
bilateral or double-descent.

RESEARCHES ON GREAT PLAINS PHASE SITES IN SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO 1968-9

Otero Junior College continued its second year of summer field
training and research involving undergraduate students. The late
prehistoric occupation in this area is well represented along the southern
tributaries of the Arkansas River. Current excavations have produced
information suggesting that these people were more nomadic and marginal
than earlier researches have indicated. Occupation seems to have been short
term, widespread and of a hunting-gathering nature. Game animals were
probably an important and preferred source of protein yet the more
consistent presence of gathering implements would suggest the collection
and processing of wild vegetable foods was the main source of survival.

A tentative analysis of the stone tools recovered would suggest
that the knives and scrapers were rarely refined (flaked) into
distinctive shapes but merely used in the form of unretouched or
partially shaped flakes. The total archaeological picture suggests the
presence of a marginal existence of small groups (bands?) ranging in size
on the average, between five and ten family groups. The widespread presence
is obvious in rock shelters, on terraces and defensive bluff positions. The
sudden appearance, short term occupation and sudden disappearance
presents some interesting possibilities and enigmas regarding ecological
and cultural changes in the late prehistoric period.

CERAMIC TRADITIONS IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN OKLAHOMA
A review of pottery from the Oklahoma Plains and comparison with
published descriptions of specimens from adjacent regions suggest that two
major ceramic traditions are represented in central and western Oklahoma.
One tradition is characterized by wide-mouthed jars with direct rims. Some of
the vessels in the wide-mouthed tradition, particularly those from western
Oklahoma, resemble Harlen Cord-roughened ware of western Kansas and Nebraska in
having more or less conoidal bases, straight rims which are often
slightly out-turned near the lip, and over-all exterior cord-roughening
with the cord impressions vertical and parallel. In central Oklahoma the
vessels in this tradition often have attributes suggestive of influence
from the Caddoan area, such as flat bases and partial or complete
obliteration of the cord-roughening. The wide-mouthed tradition is characteristic
of the Pruitt site for which there are radiocarbon dates of A.I), 690+ 90
and A.D, 810+ 90. The second ceramic tradition in central and western
Oklahoma is characterized by jars with constricted necks and vertical
to flaring straight rims. In western Oklahoma the constricted-neck
tradition is represented by both cord-roughened and smoothed vessels, the
latter sometimes having loop handles, rim tabs, and shoulder nodes. Caddoan
influences, such as smoothed surfaces, slightly flattened bases, and certain
decorative techniques, increase in frequency toward central Oklahoma
and at relatively late sites. The constricted-neck tradition is characteristic
of sites assigned to the Washita River focus for which there are several radio-
carbon dates ranging from A.D. 1010 + 150 to A.D. 1385 + 50. Pottery
from both the wide-mouthed and constricted-neck traditions occur together |
at some sites, particularly in the Custer focus of western Oklahoma. The |
traditions appear to merge at the Mouse site for which there is a radio-
carbon date of A.D. 950 + 100. It is Suggested that in central and western
Oklahoma there is a relatively early, wide mouthed ceramic tradition of ca. |
A.D. 500 to 1100 and a relatively late, constricted-neck tradition of ca.
A.D. 900 to 1600, |

PROGRAMMED TYPOLOGY AS PREHISTORIC ETHNOSCIENCE: AN EXAMPLE FROM
CAHOKIA BURIALS
Caches of stone projectile points excavated by Fowler from burials
at Cahokia Mound appeared by inspection to contain more or less
discrete groupings or types (Fowler, 1967). This rare case where the
prehistoric Indians were thoughtful enough to arrange specimens in types seemed
an ideal test sample for the general algorithm I have suggested (Benfer, 1967)
for the solution of archaeological taxonomies.
Specifically, a large number of measurements and observations were
taken on each speciman, and the intercorrelations among characteristics
were factor analyzed to locate nonredundant dimensions. In this example
the culturability, or percentage of cultural determination was not
available, so all factors were treated as of equal cultural significance.
A hierarchical grouping analysis by nonredundant characteristics was performed
and the specimens were arranged into types. Comparisons of these
statistically generated types with the actual archaeological or
paleoethnoclassification produced very close agreement. Apparently the
method of factor analysis is sensitive to slight differences among very
similar specimans and typed these points successfully by the criteria
established by the prehistoric pallbearers.

THE PREHISTORY OF THE CHILEAN ARAUCANEAN AREA
We consider the Araucanean area the Central-South part of Chile,
more or less equivalent to the Central valley of Chile from Santiago

sequences, especially for the so-called "'Picunche" area and partially too,
for the Mapuche area. For the Huilliche area is even less clear the
picture.

We could show now, through pottery types and other artifacts,
Similarities that the early ceramic cultures from the Mapuche area, by
sure the early agriculturalist in that zone and probably a kind of pre-
or proto- Araucanian culture has, coming from or through the Northern .
areas.

THE TURKISH POTTER IN SOUTHERN MUGLA VILAYET

This paper summarizes information obtained in preliminary studies
in the summer of 1968 with a grant from the Canada Council. Two centers
of pottery production in the province of Mugla, Bodrum and Ula, have been
investigated. In Bodrum three potteries are in operation while in Ula
there are, at present, four potteries, A comparison of data from the two
centers indicates that there are many Similarities in all aspects of modern
pottery production, and it is therefore possible to abstract a model
of pottery production representative of southern Mugla Vilayet. The
discussion is at this level of abstraction except where otherwise
indicated.

The general discussion of the production model describes; the
organization of space in the pottery shop, the accumulation of the
necessary raw materials, the basic techniques and tools of production, the
shapes and types of decoration of pottery, the distribution and marketing

| of these wares. Factors which seem to effect pottery production are location
of the pottery, location of markets, means of transportation, sources
of competition, and sources of innovation. Some data is available
which makes it possible to discuss the potter's training, his attitudes
about his work and products, and the social position of the potter.

There is evidence that innovation occurred in the recent past:
in the last thirty years there has been a complete change-over from the
use of a hand wheel to the use of a kick wheel; more recently
new shapes and decoration have been introduced- all of these apparently
on local initiative.

Thus this study provides evidence for variety and change both
in pottery production techniques and in the pots produced.

This evidence, in so far as it related to the range of variation

of pottery shapes and designs produced by a Single pottery or potter, the
potter's idea of significant variation, and the realtionship between means
of transportation and the distribution of a potter's wares, may well be
of relevance to archaeology.

achieving aims that are defined by theoretical propositions.

The possibly significant age of this burial, the variety of

FARLY LOWER UPPER PALEOLITHIC MAN ANI) LATE UPPER MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC
TOOLS
The appearance of Homo sapiens in Europe, the Near East and Africa

must represent either an in situ evolution of Neandertals or a migration.

Those who suggest the latter claim a sudden replacement of Neandertals

by Homo sapiens. However, the ‘evidence’ actually cited claims only the

Tisai ves accent of Middle by Upper Paleolithic industries.

We criticize the migration explanation on two groupnds.

1. There is no ‘sudden replacement’ of Middle Paleolithic by Upper
Paleolithic industries, but rather a gradual change in the
frequencies of already present tools. Numerous sites in these
areas exhibit transitional industries.

2. Even if there were a 'sudden' replacement of industries, this
would not be relevant to the problem at hand. There is no
absolute association between Homo sapiens and Upper Paleolithic
industries. Rather, the evidence Clearly shows that early
Homo sapiens is a late Middle Paleolithic local phenomena.

AN EXAMINATION INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE "QUIMBAYA'' GOLD
STYLE AND CERTAIN CERAMIC STYLES OF THE MIDDLE CAUCA VALLEY, COLOMBIA
Examination and study of museum and private collections of artifacts
from the Middle Cauca Valley, from the cultural area generally called
Quimbaya, during the summer of 1966, revealed many new facts about the
cultures of that area. One of the results of this study was an amplification
and clarification of the ceramic style that Wendell Bennett* called
the Brownware Incised style. This ware was not only more clearly
defined, new categories were added to it and other shapes were discovered
to be related. The study of a tomb group belonging to this pottery group
and interviews with persons who had seen the tomb or who know the excavators
added to the corpus of information available on this very distinctive group of
1 ceramics. Not only was a much amplified and detailed definition of the style
possible, but an admittedly tentative area of distribution was drawn up and
one of the many tomb types reported from the Middle Cauca was definitely
associated with this pottery group. The style of anthropomorphic
decoration associated with this pottery style is rather unique in terms of
representational art styles of this area and bears certain strong
resemblances to the gold ornaments and receptacles of anthropomorphic form
and decoration which are commonly called Quimbaya. An examination point for
point of stylistic features shows so many points of similarity or identity
that the relationship between the ceramic style and the gold style seems certain.
Points of difference can be explained by the use of different media and the
differing functions of the vessels and ornaments; differences in distribution by
the apparent difference in function and by the prevalence of a strong
tradition of commerce with other tribes in the Cauca valley.

CERAMIC STYLES AND LATE WOODLAND CULTURAL DYNAMICS IN NORTHWESTERN
MICHIGAN
Archaeological survey and excavation in the northwestern portion of
Michigan's Lower Peninsula shows that Late Woodland villages of the region
are confined to a narrow coastal zone called the Traverse corridor. This
corridor is almost ten miles wide but extends approximately 100 miles
from Grand Traverse Bay in the south to the Straits of Mackinac in the north.
Radiocarbon dates indicate Late Woodland occupation of the corridor
from Al) 800 to the time of Furopean contact. Preliminary analysis of
ceramic assemblages of five large sites indicate strong cultural influences
of northern origin prior to AD 1000, The next few centuries are characterized
by locally developed and rather stable ceramic styles which are only
slightly influenced from both the south and the north, After AD 1300
northern influences again predominate.
Southward cultural influences into the Traverse Corridor may correspond
to periods of climactic deterioration.

In the course of development, many cultures face periods os -
increasing population during which the subsistence economy is subjec y+
stress. In this situation, a variety of adaptations are possible. Some, oo
such as hydraulic agriculture, involve large scale cooperative labor.
Others may involve only small scale measures such as soil conservation,

PALEO-CLIMATE AND PREHISTORIC CULTURAL INTERRACTION IN THE EASTERN
ARCTIC
The movement of cultures in the Eastern North American Arctic is seen
as the result of fluctuations in climate. Climatic changes effectively
limited travel and caused alternate periods of cultural homogeneity and cultural
diversity across wide geographic expanses during the prehistoric period.
These fluctuations in climate and cultural interraction are discussed.

THE PASGAH CULTURE: A PRELIMINARY STATEMENT ON A LATE PRENTISTORIC
MANIFESTATION IN TIE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
A distinctive archaeological culture, termed Pasgah, can be defined
for a portion of the southern Appalachian Mountains in the period c A.D.
1350-1550. It can be demonstrated that this culture was the product of
a long sequence of local development, as well as of a complex process
of interaction through time between mountain cultures and those of
surrounding regions. It also can be shown that this late prehistoric
phase contributed significantly to the development of the historically-
known Cherokee culture.

THE SUSQUEHANNA TRADITION IN SOUTHFASTERN NEW ENGLAND .
The Susquehanna Tradition has been recognized as a discrete entity among
the Late Archaic cultures of New England. Three phases have been
defined within the tradition, extending through time from 2000 to 1000 B.C.
The phases- Atlantic, Watertown, and Coburm- will be briefly described
and their characteristic artifacts illustrated. The appearance of the
Susquehanna Tradition in the Northeast, its subsequent developments and
ultimate assimilation in the Orient phase will be analyzed in terms of |
cultural, historical and social processes.

NEW EVIDENCE ON THE END OF THE MOCHE STYLE

The Moche style, which flourished on the north coast of Peru during
the first millenium A.D. was replaced by a Huari-related style originating
in the southern sierra. Recent excavation has yielded a fascinating
glimpse of the mixture of these two great styles as reflected
in ceramics and a large structure with a series of polychrome murals. The
mixture of these two styles was to have Significant consequences in the
formation of the subsequent Stylistic tradition of the north coast.

GEOLOGIC EVIDENCE OF FREQUENT CLIMATIC CHANGES ENDURED BY IDAHO

PALEOINDIANS

: The three-part subdivision of post-Pleistocene climate and time in

Western United States developed by Antevs was suited to then-existing
knowledge and served its purpose well. Now, new studies by Bryson
and his associates have shown that in many areas there were several shifts
of climatic parameters and that these were not necessarily parallel from
place to place.

Indication of at least local frequency and magnitude of post-glacial
climatic variations is provided by a highly unusual exposure in a coliapsed
lava tube situated on the Snake River Plain 30 km west of Idaho falls.
Excavations by the Upper Snake River Prehistoric Society, directed hy
Butler, revealed a 3 meter section of laminated silts, The lower layers are
deformed by involutions indicative of permafrost activity. Continuity of
layers is interrupted by V-shaped intrusions of sediment marking former
positions of ice wedges. There are at least six well-defined horizons below
which ice wedges developed, each horizon marking a former cave-floor surface.

Each generation of ice wedges probably formed when mean annual |
air temperature was below -6°C, and Ground temperature of below -15 C for
a period of years, Each successive generation of ice wedges melted and
sediment casts formed during warmer periods. Overlying sediments were
introduced mainly by wind, during a third kind of climatic regime,
Radiocarbon dates indicate that three of these tripartate climatic cycles
occurred between 7900 and 6600 B.P. Scattered artifacts and a layer of
butchered bones show that man was at least occassionally present during
this interval.

THE ROLE OF THE FRONTIER IN CULTURAL TRANSMISSION

The frontier zone between two autonomous cultural systems forms an
area in which change is much more prevalent than in the hinterlands of
either of the systems. When such a zone extends over a long distance, it
, 12
becomes a corridor along which new ideas may spread rapidly and
sporadically due to the greater receptivity to change. Such zones might
help to explain peculiarities of distribution which frequently
trouble archaeologists. Ultimately the zones result from a combination
of ecological and cultural factors. An example is drawn from Mississippian-
Late Woodland relationships in the eastern United States,

TOWARD A PREHISTORY OF THE NA-DENE

Arguing chiefly from the occurrence of microblades, Borden has
hypothesized that ancestral speakers of Na-Dene, present in Alaska

| in the terminal Pleistocene, spread through the corridor between the
Rockies and the Coast Mountains of British Columbia into the Pacific
Northwest, where they arrived by 5000 B.C.

Based upon the distribution of Na-Dene languages and the occurrence
of side-notched projectile points in northwestern North America, two additional
hypotheses are added to that of Borden:

1. Once they occupied territory from Alaska through British Columbia,
Na-Dene people provided the means for the spread of side-notched projectile
hlades from the continental United States to Alaska before 4000 B.C., and a
northward population shift hy them during the Hypsithermal accounts
for the relative geographic positions of Haida, Tlingit, and Eyak.

2. After the Hypsithermal, a further dispersal south and east from
Alaska served to spread the specifically Athapaskan languages.

FAUNAL AND FLORAL REMAINS AS INDICATORS OF NEOTHERMAL CLIMATES AT

HOGUP CAVE

In 1948, Antevs proposed the name Neothermal for that period of
warming temperatures follewing the Pleistocene glaciations. Based largely
upon phenomona from the Great Basin of North America, he divided the
Neothermal into three major ages, Anathermal, 7,000-5,000 B,C.; Altithermal
5,900-2500 B.C., and the Medithermal, 2,500 B.C. to present.

The 16 layers excavated from Hogup Cave had been dated by carbon 14.
As concerns time, layers 1-3, 4-8 and 9-16 closely parallel the Anathermal,
Altithermal and Medithermal ages respectively. Faunal and floral remains
from each of these layers have been carefully studied with reference to
extent of occurrence and varying amounts of the different kinds.

The faunal and floral remains from Hogup cave do not lend themselves

|
, 13
well in support of Antevs' thesis, At best, they appear only to depict
certain trends in numbers and occurrences of the several kinds. Twenty
eight species of plants were recorded from the 16 layers. With some
minor exceptions, all are still present or not far removed from the
immediate area,

Based upon the osteological remains of 3418 mammals, it is evident
that the mammalian fauna of the area throughout the Neothermal was
remarkably similar and is the same as that foynd there today. This indicates
that with’some fluctuations, there existed a certain Similarity in
environmental factors throughout these past nine millenia. Interpretations
of the data lead us to consider that the climate of the Ilogup area during
the Neothermal was cooler in early Anathermal, then hecoming gradually
warmer reaching a moderately high temperature during the Altithermal and
then gradually cooling until the present.

These data seem to confirm that if the Altithernal age was a reality,
then its appearance in the western segement of the Bonneville Basin
was not marked and possibly was of short duration.

PLEISTOCENE EXTINCTIONS AND THE FIRE-DRIVE

If climate or parasites did not effect megafaunal extinctions, what
mechanism did sparse, primitive hunters employ? Perhans the 200 genera
were extinguished by the widespread fire-drive, which was the most
efficient (per man hour) technique available, with selective removal
of larger, slower prey, less securing of cover. Yet fire-drives,
typically feasible only seasonally or irregularly, are highly variable in
productivity. Additional fires might compensate, but would largely
preclude territoriality and long-term man- land equilibrium. Furthermore,
fire drives scarcely account for megafaunal survivals in the American arctic
and subarctic, for European temperate and the African and Asian tropics, or
for thorough extinctions in American rain forests and swamps. Despite some
advantages of forest undergrowth and grassland burning, megafaunal fire-

drives are unneeded and inefficiently wasteful of game, with lower
human density and resultant selective disadvantage in interareal competition.
Also perhaps significant are Plains bison, flourishing despite fire-drives.
A postulated rapid wave of exterminating fire-drive hunters, advancing
eee the Americas, lacks a corroborating abrupt faunal er cultural
break.
Apparently, progressively efficient (with likely occasional fire-

drives, especially for small mammals) and therefore sparse hunters were

| in equilibrium with prey, few if any species of which succombed until a

. broadening economic base effected extinctions.

THE USE OF THE HELICOPTER IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY

Helicopters are coming into increasingly greater use as archaeological
survey vehicles. This paper discusses their advantages and limitations
with particular reference to the nature of the reconnaissance, types of
terrain traversed, visibility, and aerial photography.

BRAZILIAN ARCHAEOLOGY IN 1968: AN INTERIM REPORT ON THE NATIONAL

PROGRAM OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH

Brazil can be divided into two geographical areas: the Coastal
Strip and the Amazon Basin. Coordinated systematic survey and testing on
the Coastal Strip between 1965-8 shows the Preceramic Period to have lasted
until about A.D. 500 except in an enclave on the Bahia Coast, where the
Periperi ceramic tradition dates from the 9th century B.C. Although a
variety of preceramic complexes has been recognized particularly in the
south, primary attention has been placed on the ceramic period. Several
regional ceramic traditions have been identified, which appear to be generally
contemporary with the area-wide Tupiguarani tradition. The latter
is divisible into three subtraditions, the earliest of which emphasizes
painted decoration, the second corrugation, and the most recent brushing.

Subsequent to European contact, a Neo-Brazilian ceramic tradition developed,
in which aboriginal and European traits are amalgamated.

Although the archaeology of the Amazon Basin is more poorly known,
none of the existing data shows any evidence of contact with the occupants
of the Coastal Strip or vice versa. The strength of the ecological
barrier between the two areas is reflected in the affiliation of complexes
on the upper Rio Xingu, on the ecological border, with the Amazonian
Incised and Punctate tradition and the total lack of any features suggesting
contact with cultures of the Coastal Strip.

SOME ASPECTS OF MAYA CEREMONIAL ACTIVITIES AT TIKAL, GUATEMALA

Evidence of a Maya ceremonial event is occasionally found in the form
of residual ritual material, including pottery incense burners, left in
situ at the conclusion of the ceremony. Usually, however, the ritual |
material is no longer to be found in such primary contexts, and the more |
abundant material in secondary contexts must be made to yield its quantitative |
and qualitative data to provide a broader picture of ceremonial activity at
the site.

An investigation of the on-site distribution of incense burners, their |
patterns of association with buildings, monuments, and other features, and :
the nature of the contexts in which they most commonly occur, provides
information bearing upon the nature, purpose, and prevalence of certain )
ceremonial activities at Tikal.

EXCAVATIONS AT MIAMI FORT, HAMILTON COUNTY, OHIO
The department of Sociology and Anthropology of the University of
Cincinnati conducted archaeological investigations in and around the
prehistoric site of Miami Fort during the summers of 1965,1966 and 1967.
Miami Fort is a large ridgetow enclosure in southwestern Hamilton County, Ohio.
The primary objectives of these investigations were to learn when the
earthworks were constructed, what prehistoric group undertook such an
extensive construction project, and, finally, why. Carbonized material from
the lower portion of one of the defensive embankments yielded a radio-
carbon date of 270 A.D. + 130 (M-1869). Cultural material recovered in
the excavation of a habitation area within the eastern portion of the
enclosure seems to substantiate this date. Although the artifacts recovered
in the habitation area represent a Middle Woodland phase, none of the
attributes usually associated with the Hopewell culture are present. An
: intensive survey of the surrounding area has resulted in the discovery
of numerous small Middle Woodland terrace sites. These sites can be
assigned to the ‘Miami Focus' on the basis of a distinctive projectile
point type found within the Miami Fort enclosure. Investigations at Miami
Fort would seem to support Olaf Prufer's Suggestion that the ridge-top
enclosures represent 'general refuge positions, rather than true fortifications’
and that the construction of these enclosures was the joint effort of
a number of small related hamlets.

SCHEDULING IN A SHARED ENVIRONMENT: LATE WOODLAND LAND USE IN THE
SAGINAW VALLEY, MICHIGAN
During the Late Woodland period, prehistoric Michigan was occupied
by groups with three distinctive environmental adaptive patterns. Fach
pattern was marked by an internal ‘scheduling' for the maximum use of
available resources. Because of its wide variety of resources and
geographical position, the Saginaw Valley of Michigan was incorporated into
the scheduling of groups representing all three adaptive patterns.
Archaeological and historical evidence Suggests that the Valley was shared
on a seasonal basis until the Middle Historic period,
