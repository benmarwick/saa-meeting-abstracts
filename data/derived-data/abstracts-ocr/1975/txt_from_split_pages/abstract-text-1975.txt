!
Guatemala zone. The participants have been chosen to insure coverage of important topics
and to reflect different points of view. Their papers will illustrate the range and variety of
information that may be obtained from both pre-Conquest and post-Hispanic documentary
materials, as well as show how these sources may be integrated with one another and with
other data to reveal new aspects of ancient Mesoamerican culture.
(16, 22) PREHISTORIC ADAPTATIONS IN THE CHIHUAHUAN DESERT. The
Chihuahuan Desert covers a large area of south-central North America and evidences a long
post-glacial occupation by peoples having largely extractive technologies. Archaeological
and, when available, ethnobotanical data from Frightful Cave in Coahuila, sites in
Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, Chihuahua, southern and southwest Texas are synthesized. Basic
problems which can be used to frame future research are outlined and together, emphasize
the archaeological resource potential of the Chihuahuan Desert for the study of
hunter-gatherer and horticultural adaptations to arid and semi-arid lands.
(17) ARCHAEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT AT DIRTY SHAME ROCKSHELTER,
SOUTHEAST OREGON, Dirty Shame Rockshelter, in the Owyhee Uplands on the
northeastern edge of the Grant Basin, was occupied from before 9500 B.P. down to historic
times. The symposium reports the results of environmental and cultural studies based on
data from the sheiter, and tentatively defines a sequence of cultural/environmental change
and stability spanning Holocene time in the region.
(18) ARCHAEOECONOMICS—PART !: GOALS, THEORIES, AND MODELS, Archaeolo-
gists are increasingly involved in economic anthropological research where they benefit from
a data set reflecting tong term, repeated socio-economic interactions, both on a regional and
local scale. In recent years the use of sophisticated techniques to establish the origin of raw
materials and artifacts from archaeological sites have permitted the delineation of
prehistoric trade relationships. However, the identification of processes affecting the
stability and change of prehistoric economic systems remain a vexing problem. This
symposium will explore the potential directions of archaeological research on economic
systems by defining new theories and models commensurate with archaeological data.
(19) DYNAMICS OF CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT. The newness of conserva-
tion archaeology has caused a revolution of ideas among professionals and government
stewards alike that has led into reactions not yet well thought out. Government agencies
have not firmed up interpretations of public laws and executive orders but are attempting to
do so. The profession does not know what is specifically required to fulfill environmental
impact statements. We must recognize limits of trained man power, availability of funds,
ideals for research, facilities, requirements of industry, and economic factors, tt is
imperative that clear guidelines be formulated involving agency requirements, the issuing of
permits, quality of work, and long range conservation goals.
(21) ADVANCES IN ARCHAEOMETRY AND ARCHAEOCHRONOMETRICS, This
symposium reports on advances and developments of new analytical and dating methods
and new approaches and resuits from existing methods. Papers include reports from
different groups working in amino acid and obsidian hydration dating as well as a progress
report on the fluorine diffusion dating of chipped lithic materials.
(23) INFORMATION THEORY: MODELS AND MEASUREMENT OF ARCHAEOLOG|I-
CAL SYSTEMS. Information theory, developed in the fields of communciation theory,
Se and mathematical statistics, has recently proven useful in the quantitative
analysis of archaeological data. Several such applications are explored in this symposium,
ranging from questions of coding theory to quantitative tests of cultural laws and
measurement of organization in social systems. The data bases considered, which include
ceramics, stone tool assemblages, and mortuary patterns, indicate the diversity of
contributions which information theory can make to the quantitative analysis of
archaeological systems.
(24, 25) APPROACHES TO FAUNAL ANALYSIS IN THE MIDDLE EAST. The purpose of
this symposium is to serve as a forum for discussion of different approaches to faunal
analysis as dictated by differing sites, their problems, and the orientation of both excavator
and analyst. Participants will be individuals presently engaged in the analysis of faunal
materials from Middie Eastern sites. Emphasis will be placed on methods and approaches
and not on the results of investigations, It is hoped that the inclusion of both zoologists and
archaeologists trained in bone analysis will serve to promote a productive discussion of

| present concerns and of future directions for research.
(26) WILDERNESS AND CULTURAL VALUES. Wilderness legislation and current studies
to increase the number of acres of Wilderness land both have implications for the

| management of cultural resources (both historic and prehistoric) within Wilderness areas.
This symposium explores the conflicts with and benefits to our cultural resources as a result
of Wilderness legislation and management practices.

| (31) EXPANSION OF THE INCA STATE: A PERSPECTIVE FROM ARCHAEOLOGY
AND ETHNOHISTORY. Several recent archaeological and ethnohistorical studies have
focused on socio-political and economic expansion of the Inca state into coastal and

16
, hightand areas of the Central Andes. The theme of expansion provides the basis for
arguments of relevance to substantive aspects of state development; for example, changing
functions of the political system, economic participation of subjugated territories,
population movement, resource use, and urbanization. Toward that end, the participants of
this symposium present papers containing different kinds of data gathered from different
parts of the Central Andes. In general, the aim of this symposium is to contribute to the
broad framework in which we can organize our knowledge for the formulation of
hypotheses regarding the development and spread of the Inca state.
(33, 34) EARLY MAN IN THE NEW WORLD: A VIEW AS WE APPROACH THE
SEMI-CENTENNIAL OF THE FIRST PALEO-INDIAN DISCOVERY AT FOLSOM, NEW
MEXICO. The program is designed to bring to light information on new sites in the
Paleo-indian field, as well as new developments related to old sites. Regional summaries and
discussion of aspects of lithic technology are also included.
(35, 41) QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF INTRASITE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS. The
symposium deals with quantitative approaches to the analysis of spatial distributions on an
intrasite level. Given increased but diffuse interest in statistical manipulation of spatial! data,
the session will draw together scholars with shared interests and hopefully will facilitate
exchange of ideas. On the theoretical level, the symposium should provide answers to
questions which turn on the behavioral correlates of spatial associations. On the
methodological level, it should provide a forum in which individuals can discuss the various
analytical techniques currently in use (e.g., nearest neighbor analysis, dimensional analysis
of variance).
(36) RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL WORK IN AFRICA AND THE NEAR EAST.
Preliminary reports are presented of recent fieldwork undertaken in the Near East and
Africa. Emphasis is on Paleolithic studies, including local dating and specific site
investigations.
(37) REGIONAL SURVEYS IN THE SOUTHWEST: RESULTS AND PROBLEMS. A
number of regional survey projects in the Southwest have been underway for several years.
Previous symposia have caught many of these projects in early stages, and have emphasized
research design, research prospects, and preliminary results. The time is right for taking
stock of these projects at the mature stage of development they have now reached.
Emphases will be on substantive results and evaluations of the advantages and problems
found to date in the various research designs. Formal and informal discussions will provide
opportunities for comparsion of archaeological and methodological results.
(38) UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY. The current status of underwater archaeology is
explored. Recent projects are discussed as well as developments in methodology. Topics
include survey, excavation and interpretation of drowned prehistoric sites and shipwreck
sites.
(42) NEW WORLD LITHIC ANALYSIS: REGIONAL EVALUATIONS. The last decade has
seen a continuing increase and focus on lithic studies in the New World. Although much of
lithic analysis is stil! concerned with using traditionally derived typologies of selected classes
of artifacts for creating regional chronologies, many new and exciting analytical approaches
and techniques are also being utilized to answer different kinds of questions. This
symposium evaluates lithic analysis in the New World for the last decade, focusing on (1)
the problems and questions being studied by lithic experts in each region; (2) the methods
and techniques used for analysis in each region—and what has succeeded and what has
failed; and (3) an evaluation of the present and future contribution of specialized lithic
studies to the archaeology of each region.

ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS
Ackerman, Robert E. (Washington S) CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY AND ARCHAE-
OLOGICAL RESEARCH: THE NORTH TONGASS NATIONAL FOREST, SOUTHEAST
ALSAKA, During the latter part of the 1974 field season, an archaeological survey of
proposed timber harvesting areas on Chichagof and Baranof Islands (northern Alexander
Archipelago) was conducted for the U.S. Forest Service. As part of a multiple-use planning
team, the author, as an archaeologist, was asked to play the roles of resource management
planner, educator, and ethnographer-politician, in addition to the familiar role of research
investigator. These new role relationships are briefly explored in terms of a developing
program of archaeological research studies in Southeastern Alaska. The report concludes
with a discussion of the prehistoric and historic cultural relationships of the northern sector
of the Alexander Archipelago. Data from the 1974 survey and the 1971 and 1973 research
studies in the Icy Strait region are utilized and interpreted in the light of previously reported
and new geomorphological and site chronological information.(28)
Adovasio, James M. (Pittsburgh) THE EVOLUTION OF BASKETRY MANUFACTURE IN
NORTHERN MEXICO AND TRANS-PECOS TEXAS. Systematic, attribute oriented,
comparative analyses of virtually all of the extant basketry collections from Northern
Mexico and Trans-Pecos Texas permit the delineation of detailed developmental sequences
of basketry manufacture in both areas. These 9000+ Year sequences are presented and
compared in terms of origins, technical affinities, and principal developmental trends.(16)
Adovasio, James M., R. Andrews, and R. Carlisle (Pittsburgh) PERISHABLE INDUSTRIES
FROM DIRTY SHAME ROCKSHELTER. The manufacture of basketry, sandals, and
cordage at Dirty Shame Rockshelter is discussed in terms of process and product. The
evolution of these industries throughout the occupational sequence is detailed and
compared to developmental! sequences elsewhere in the Northern Great Basin. Utilizing the
Dirty Shame perishable data in conjunction with data from other sites in the region, a
general developmental sequence for all of the industries in question is generated for the
entire Northern Great Basin.(17)

Aguilera, Carmen (Consejo de Historia, INAH, Mexico) SPEECH SCROLLS IN THE
FLORENTINE CODEX. The so-called ‘‘speech scrolis"’ appear in prehispanic codices and
murals at least since Classic times, to denote basically two human actions: speech and
singing and/or poetry. In Colonial times the functions and shapes of ‘‘speech scrolls’’ change
in a way similar to some types of speech indicated in comic books. This phenomenon can be
exemplified by the examination of ‘‘speech scrolis"’ in the Florentine Codex. Here the
designs of the “speech scrolis"' vary widely, in some cases because of the function, in others
because of the style of the artist.(12, 13)
Aikens, ae (Oregon) EARLY OCCUPATION WEST OF THE ROCKIES: AN
OVERVI . A review of the early and putatively early finds in western North America
(excluding the Southwest) shows that no credible geologic, radiometric, or typologic
support exists to adequately demonstrate human occupance of the region prior to the time
of the fluted point horizon. Surface finds of fluted points have now become sufficiently
numerous throughout the western United States that the presence there of a Liano-like
Paleo-indian horizon can no longer be reasonably doubted, though its precise character
remains unclear. A lithic complex characterized by large modified lanceolate/foliate point
forms (San Dieguito, Windust, Milliken), widespread in the western Intermontane region by
at least 10,000 years ago, is hypothesized as derivative from a western fluted point horizon;
an analogy is drawn with the Liano-Plano transition on the Great Plains.(33, 34)
Ajikens, C. Melvin (see Minor, Rick)(17)
Allsburg, John B. Van, and Denise E. King (Michigan S) SHAPE ANALYSIS: A NEW
APPROACH TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA. Shape discrimination analysis, a quantitative
technique developed by geologists, expresses the shape of an object in terms of harmonics.
The computer program approximates the shape of the object through comparison of the real
shape with a Fourier series. We will apply this technique to a collection of scrapers from the
Finch site in California. The purpose of this research is to: (1) determine if shape analysis
soives a basic problem of attribute measurement; (2) compare taxonomies that exclude
quantitative measures with a taxonomy that includes shape; and (3) to evaluate this
technique of analysis.(14)
Anawailt, Patricia (UCLA) DIFFERENTIAL USE OF AZTEC MILITARY GARMENTS: A
TEXTUAL ANALYSIS. In the course of research on pan-Mesoamerican costume patterns
18
, three classes of Aztec military garments could be distinguished: the warrior costume,
tlahuiztli; the quilted armor, ichcahuipilli; and the tunic worn over the ichcahuipilli, ehuatl.
It is the purpose of this paper to present a descriptive and functional analysis of these three
types of military garb, drawing data from relevant codices and sixteenth century documents.
The attempt is made to ascertain the social or situational context which determined the
class of costume utilized, as well as the rank and status of the wearer.(43)
Anderson, Duane C. (see Shutler, Richard, Jr.)(33, 34)
Andreson, John M. (lilinois) and Raymond Sidrys (UCLA) OBSIDIAN SOURCES IN THE
MAYA AREA. Our purpose is to standardize the existing data on the eleven obsidian
sources in the Maya area. New data are also presented from a month-long survey during
January 1974. The size and location of outcrops are emphasized, although quarry artifacts,
hydration dates, and chemical characterization are also discussed.(43)

Arnold, J. Barto Ill (Texas Antiquities Committee) NEW MARINE MAGNETOMETER
SURVEY TECHNOLOGY FOR UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS.
instrumentation including proton magnetometer, radio positioning, and caliculator-plotter-
data recorder system was assembled for an inventory of the shipwreck site resources off a 25
mile segment of the south Texas coast. Hardware and software interfaces were developed for
this instrumentation system as well as software programs for the vessel track plotter,
calculating and recording Universal Transverse Mercator Grid coordinates for the position of
each magnetometer reading and a rough plot for field analysis of data. Other programs were
written for transfering data from cassettes to one inch magnetic tape, editing and finally the
production of computer drawn contour maps of the magnetic data for final analysis. This
marine magnetometer survey system was successfully utilized in locating numerous sites for
further investigation through test excavations.(38)
Aten, Lawrence E. (Nati Park Service) COORDINATION OF FEDERAL DATA
RECOVERY ACTIVITIES. Cultural resources include archaeological, architectural, and
historic objects, structures, sites, and districts. To illustrate the federal government's policy
with regard to these resources, four related papers are presented. The first deals with the
foundation of laws upon which these procedures rest. The second discusses the resource
management procedures that have evolved in response to these laws. To further jllustrate the
law-policy relationship, the third paper deals exclusively with the National Environmental
Policy Act, and the development and synthesis of cultural resource data which must be
prepared in compliance with it. The fourth paper summarizes the integrated federal
approach to historic preservation and resource conservation.(19)
Ayres, James E. (Arizona) CULTURAL VALUES IN THE WILDERNESS: THE CUL-
TURAL PERSPECTIVE. Most Wilderness areas contain cultural resources with both
prehistoric and historic values. Because of the unique character and special status of the
Wilderness areas, they create special problems and concerns for the resources located within
them. An assessment of current legislation, activities, attitudes and events surrounding
archaeological and historic sites in Wilderness areas are the subject of this discussion.(26)
Bada, Jeffrey L., and Pat Helfman (California-San Diego) FURTHER EVIDENCE OF THE
ANTIQUITY OF MAN IN NORTH AMERICA DEDUCED USING ASPARTIC ACID
RACEMIZATION REACTION. Recently published aspartic acid racemization ages for
several California Paleo-Indians have suggested that man was present in North America at
least 50,000 years B.P. Because of the important implications of these dates, we have carried
out further analysis on various parts of one of the skeletons (Del Mar Man) in order to test
the reproducibility of the earlier results. The results show that all bones from the skeleton
yield the same D/L aspartic acid ratios, e.g., 0.50. Also, we have analyzed several other
California Paleo-Indian skeletons and have found additional examples of fossil hominids
which have ages of 50,000 years or more. We believe these results provide additional
evidence that man was present in the New World earlier than originally thought.(21)
Baird, Ellen Taylor (New Mexico) EUROPEAN ELEMENTS IN BOOK |X OF THE CODEX
FLORENTINO, Bernardino de Sahagun’s encyclopedic work, the ‘‘Historia general de las
cosas de Nueva Espana,"' has often been used by scholars for the information it contains on
pre-conquest Mexico. However, the last complete version of the manuscript, the “Codex
Florentino,"’ was completed approximately 60 years after the conquest. Although the
subject matter of the manuscript is predominantly pre-Columbian, the influence of the
Spaniards is evident in the numerous European elements of style and form that appear in
the illustrations. This paper analyzes the European pictorial elements in Book IX of the
gs with particular emphasis on their significance, sources, and possible authorship.(12,
)
Baker, James G. (Dallas, Texas) THE INTRODUCTORY GLYPH—OLMEC AND MAYA. A
careful study of this hieroglyph reveals much about culture change in the proto-classic
period. tn the Maya lowlands (Tikal) early introductory glyphs are identical in form and
function with the one recently found in the Olmec area on Stela C at Tres Zapotes,
Veracruz, Mexico. Changes in the glyph as it was used on early highland Maya monuments
19
, indicate Olmec influence was weaker there than in the lowlands. The glyphic evidence
argues for direct cultural transfer from the Olmec area up the Usamacinta River to the
Peten. The irregularities in highland glyphic texts rule out the highlands as the route for
Oimec culture to diffuse to the lowland Maya. What we find in the highlands is infiuence
from the Olmec, not the direct movement of Olmec peoples as we have in the lowlands.(43)
Baker, Vernon G. (Brown) VINYL-TOPPED AUTOMOBILES AND ARCHAEOLOGY:
RESEARCH DIRECTIONS FOR THE AMATEUR AND ACADEMIAN. A study of vinyl
tops on General Motors Corporation automobiles is presented to further emphasize the need
for above-ground archaeology. Also, the study of current material culture is suggested asa
possible means of enhancing communication between amateur and academic archaeologists.

Bannister, Bryant, and William J. Robinson (Arizona) ADVANCES IN TREE-RING
DATING IN ARCHAEOLOGY. In recent years the applications of tree-ring dating have
greatly expanded in geographic coverage and in scope. The rapid growth of European
dendrochronological efforts has resulted in the establishment of absolute tree-ring
chronologies and the dating of historical and archaeological structures across northern
Europe from Ireland to western Russia. Development of long floating tree-ring chronologies
in Europe and the Near East gives promise of significant future advances. in North America,
particularly in the American Southwest, tree-ring controls have also been extended in time
and space and special attention has been focused on the development of new concepts and
techniques for archaeological interpretation. Broader applications of dendrochronological
data include recalibration of the radiocarbon time scale and reconstruction of paleoclimatic
conditions.(21)

Bellis, James D. (Notre Dame) TIME CONTROLLED SURFACE PICKUP ON THE
MOUND HOUSE SITE IN THE LOWER ILLINOIS RIVER VALLEY. In recent years, a
number of efforts have been made to bring better controls to surface survey methodology,
The efforts have dealt with spatial controls as well as various efforts to contro! the sample
taken from these spatial units. At the Mound House site in the Iilinois River Valley an
experiment was conducted with time-controfied surface pickups. It was demonstrated that
in terms of the percentages of classes of raw materials present on the surface, the first 30
minutes’ pick-up was as accurate an indicator as a total surface pick-up which could take up
to four hours.(14)

| Benfer, Alice (Missouri-Columbia) NORTHERN MESOAMERICA. Lithic studies in
Northern Mesoamerica have, until recently, been few, and generally based on unexcavated
or poorly provenienced data. The few published studies are morphological descriptions
and/or typologies based on tool morphology. These typologies were generally constructed
| for forming regional chronologies or to be used as chronological markers. Recent research

has been focused in the Central Basin and surrounding areas and has been on excavated
materials of good provenience, ranging in time from Early Classic to Post Conquest. With
the advent of C-14, 6bsidian hydration dating, and better excavation controls, interests have
shifted away from chronologies and toward other kinds of questions. Whole assemblage
analysis to,produce models of prismatic blade and core production; microwear studies of
tools to determine function; assemblage description in terms of technological and functional
rather than morphological attributes; the use of trace analysis to determine source areas and
trade routes; and the study of craft specialization in obsidian industries are among the new
approaches in lithic studies that are discussed, along with the traditional approaches.(42)
Berdichewsky, Bernardo (Texas, Austin) THE INCA CONQUEST OF THE PICUNCHE OF
CENTRAL CHILE, AND THE CORRESPONDING MODIFICATIONS OF THEIR MODE
OF PRODUCTION. The intention of this paper is to analyze the Mode of Production of the
Picunche Indians of Central Chile (or Northern Araucanians), before the Inca Conquest, and
how it was transformed by that event. When the Spaniards arrived in this region, the
Picunche had been transformed in a short time, from one Tribal Economic-Social Formation
to another of a Chiefdom. The presentation uses the archaeological and ethnohistorical data
available for that area and period.(31)

Berge, Dale L. (see Matheny, Ray T.)(19)

Berger, Rainer (UCLA) ADVANCES IN RADIOCARBON DATING. Experience with
collagen radiocarbon dates has shown that reliable dates can be obtained using the
appropriate chemical purification techniques. This is based on a comparison of collagen and
charcoal-based radiocarbon dates from different environments and age ranges. Moreover,
radiocarbon dates compare favorably with amino acid racemization dates which can be used
for calibration purposes if independent temperature measurements are available. Conversely,
radiocarbon measurements can be employed to calibrate amino acid racemization dates.
Bones have also been dated using the carbon dioxide located within the apatite structure. A
number of magnetic intensity measurements have shown that the secular variations during

20
, the last 50,000 years are not in excess of the variations during the last 10,000 years
although there may have occurred a major magnetic excursion during the early part of the
third decamillennium.(21)
Berger, Rainer (see Ericson, Jonathon E.)(21)
Betram, Jack (New Mexico) THE LAWS OF MAMMALIAN SPECIES DIVERSITY:
IMPLICATIONS FOR PALEOECOLOGY, SUBSISTENCE THEORY, COMPARATIVE
ANTHROPOLOGY, AND THE OVERKILL HYPOTHESIS. Empirical regularities in the
distribution of mammalian species numbers, density, and biomass, when coupled with
biogeographical theory, can be used as estimating equations for the evaluation of
paleoclimatic variables. Predictions are made concerning past distributions of diversity; these
predictions are tested using paleontological data. The empirical regularities so determined
have surprising implications for the overkill hypothesis, as well as for the dynamics of
human subsistence strategies under changing population pressure. Data from the late
Pleistocene in the American Southwest, the African Vilafranchian, and from ethnographical-
ly known hunters and gatherers, are considered.(27)
Bishop, Charles A. (SUNY Oswego) THE OJIBWA COLLECTIVE-ATOMISTIC
ARGUMENT RE-EXAMINED: ECONOMIC MODELS APPLIED TO HISTORICAL AND
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA. The collective versus atomistic argument for the Ojibwa and
other northeastern Algonkians has persisted for several decades without adequate resolution.
Although the supporters of aboriginal collectivism have utilized ethnohistorical evidence to
support their view, conceptual bi-polarization has distorted interpretation. A more accurate
analysis involves the use of more refined models for evaluating both the early historical
evidence and the prehistoric materials via a direct-historical-analogy model, avoiding
over-generalization of the intricacies of economics and the way this is reflected in social
organization. Modes of production, exchange, and ownership are here examined in terms of
the range of possibilities between the extremes. While the collectivists tend to be
“generally” correct, there are a number of areas in which the term collectivism is a
misleading conceptualization. The analysis resulted in a more elegant and accurate
description of the late prehistoric Ojibwa socio-economic system.(10)
Biackman, Crawford H., Jr. (Mississippi S) THE MACROSCOPIC APPROACH TO THE
IDENTIFICATION OF CHERT SOURCES. It is proposed that the use of macroscopic
lithologic traits is a practical and acceptable alternative to the use of some recent, more
sophisticated techniques of lithic source identification, if the macroscopic method of
classification is applied within the framework of a known geological context and of explicit
assumptions about the nature of human cultural behavior.(14)
Bokonyi, Sandor (Archaeological Inst of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, Budapest)
CULTURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL DIFFERENCES IN THE FAUNAL SAMPLES
FROM FIVE EARLY NEOLITHIC SITES IN SOUTHWEST ASIA. The paper compares the
animal bone samples of five sites—Umm Dabaghiyah, Tell es-Sawwan, Choga Mami in Iraq,
Labweh in Lebanon, and Sarab in |ran—from the sixth millennium B.C. Each site represents
a different environmental type. The animal bone samples of these sites can be divided into
two sharply different types. In the first type (Umm Dabaghiyah) the domestic ratio is very
low (just above 10%), in the second one It is very high (73% to 89%). In all of the sites the
caprovines are the most important domestic species (54% to 97.5% of all domestic animals).
Also, domestic pig and dog bones occur in each site, though they are very rare, On the other
hand, bones of domestic cattle are probably not present in Sarab. The composition of the
wild fauna depends completely on the environment of the sites. While in Umm Dabaghiyah
no forest animals can be found (on the other hand, the onager, this typical step species,
represents 66% to 70% of the wild animals), in the fauna of Labweh, Tell es-Sawwan, and
Choga Mami there occur some forest elements, first of all the fallow deer, and a whole series
of forest species (red deer, roe deer, wild swine, leopard, wild cat, brown bear, badger,
beaver) represent a considerable ratio besides the step animals in Sarab.(24, 25)
Boone, Elizabeth Hili (Texas-Austin) TWO PAINTING STYLES IN THE CODEX
MAGLIABECHIANO. The Codex Magliabechiano is a sixteenth century pictorial manu-
script from Central Mexico and is assumed to be a copy of a now lost pictorial prototype.
Although the derivative nature of the paintings in the Codex Magliabechiano preciudes great
irregularities in composition and iconography, two separate painting styles are apparent in
the manuscript. One style appears to be especially close to the indigenous Indian tradition
of graphic representation, while the other incorporates European pictorial elements. These
two painting styles are defined and analysed in terms of line, color, form, proportion, and
composition and their relative occurrence in the Codex Magliabechiano are discussed.(12,

Brand, Donald D. (Texas-Austin) SOME PERSISTENT MYTHS IN THE ETHNOHISTORY
OF WESTERN MEXICO: MESOAMERICAN ETHNOHISTORY—CODICES AND MANU-
SCRIPTS. Western Mexico, i.e., the northwestern portion of Mesoamerica, has had more
than its share of erroneous concepts concerning the history of its peoples just prior to the
Spanish conquest. Among the most persistent “‘myths'’ in the ethnohistory of Western
Mexico are the following three. Despite little evidence in favor and considerable evidence
against, it is still popular to claim that the Mexican (“Aztec”) state extended to the
21
, |
southwest as far as Zacatula and the mouth of the Rio Balsas. A sequence of local historians
during the last hundred years have developed a fictitious political geography of the
Nayarit-Jalisco-Colima region on the basis of an invented Chimalhuacan Confederacy. A
blind reliance on a seventeenth century Spanish Franciscan chronicier has resuited in a
general acceptance of the only origin and migration tegend from the region, as provided by
Pantecatl through Tello. Apparently the origin and persistence of such errors in Western
Mexico can be attributed chiefly to the fact that Western Mexico was conquered by the
Spaniards from a base in the Nahuatlan Valley of Mexico-Puebla region with a resultant
Nahuatlan bias, and because all of the records of the conquest and early contact period were
housed outside of Western Mexico.(12, 13)

Breternitz, David A. (Colorado) THE MESA VERDE: CULTURE AND/OR AREA? The
available citable literature on that portion of the San Juan Anasazi designated as the Mesa
Verde emphasizes investigations within the confines of Mesa Verde National Park, Recent
and current research permit us to reevaluate the Mesa Verde and to look at population
dynamics and environmental/climatic factors involved with Mesa Verde cultural evolution.
Conclusions reached include: that the Mesa Verde Proper lies on the eastern margin of the
Mesa Verde Culture “‘area”; it was initially occupied later than surrounding ‘‘lowlands"’; and,
also, later than adjacent localities which show more contact with the Chaco and Kayenta
Anasazi. The results of recent excavations, inventories of surface manifestations, and
ancillary studies is utilized to emphasize these propositions, as well as to comment on the
problem of abandonment of the entire Mesa Verde region.(20)

tions at Les Tambourets (Couladere, Haute-Garonne) documented the presence of a rich
Chatelperronian occupation level that had been known previously from surface collections.
Results of sedimentological analyses by Henri Laville are summarized. A small series of

Brockington, Paul, and Anta Montet-White (Kansas) MASS DISTRIBUTION AND SHAPE
VARIATION IN ARTIFACT ASSEMBLAGES. A Comp-U-Grid Graphic Digitizer System is
used to record sets of metrical attributes describing (1) the shape and symmetry of the
artifacts, and (2) the distribution of mass on either side of an artifact’s long axis. The
hardware is most effective in calculating perimeter and surface areas of the whole artifact as
well as the surface area of portions of the artifact. Analysis of test samples from several
assemblages are presented. In a final section, the paper discusses the significance of the
above mentioned attributes for the study of lithic technology.(3)
Broilo, Frank J., and Charles A. Reher (New Mexico) RESEARCH AND MITIGATION
CONSIDERATIONS IN THE REGIONAL CONTRACT SURVEY. Archaeological investiga-

| tions conducted under the auspices of federal and state legislation regulating cultural
resources should be implemented efficiently and in a manner congruent with contemporary
professional research standards. Several recent articles (King 1971; Gumerman 1973; Lipe
1974) have focused on the difficulty of integrating theoretical, problem-oriented research
designs with contract obligations, yet have emphasized the necessity of doing so if we are to
collect datasamenable to current explanatory concerns and successfully fulfill contract and
legislative requirements. It is suggested that an inventory survey based upon an
explicitly-defined, theoretical, interdisciplinary research design should culminate in an
efficient and economical mitigation program. The systematic collection of comprehensive
cultural and environmental data during survey should provide a data base which permits
sampling strategies to be employed in succeeding mitigating action. These considerations for
reaional or sub-regional surveying methodology were recently operationalized for the Coal
Gasification Project Survey, a contract survey of approximately 70 square miles in
northwestern New Mexico which yielded over 700 sites. Hypotheses on the nature of
Paleo-Indian, Archaic, Anasazi, and Navajo settiement-subsistence systems were generated
and tested. The resultant explanatory devices allow relatively precise predictions of site
locations and site densities, and provided the basic understanding of archaeological
manifestations necessary for an elegant mitigation design.(9)
Bronitsky, Gordon (Arizona) TRADE IN THE UNITED STATES SOUTHWEST: A
CONSIDERATION OF MODELS. A major trend in recent archaeological thinking has been
the development of the concept of culture as the primary means of human environmental
adaptation. The numerous mentions of artifacts and materials recovered from archaeological
sites which originated at great distances from the site, as well as the extensive trade
networks known to have linked historic local communities with each other and regions as
distant as California and New Mexico, suggests that Southwestern populations in the United
States may have employed trade as one mechanism to cope with environmental stress. This
paper examines the use and non-use of the trade concept in the archaeological literature
dealing with sedentary agriculturalists in the Southwest. A model of trade based on concepts
derived from ecology and anthropology will then be proposed and tentatively compared to
existing data.(27)

, Brooks, Alison S. (George Washington) FORMAL ANALYSIS OF AURIGNACIAN STONE
TOOLS IN SOUTHWEST FRANCE. Excavations by Movius at the Abri Pataud revealed a
complex series of Aurignacian levels. Attribute analysis of the stone tools, together with
those from other Aurignacian sites in Southwest France, suggests greater variability both
within. major tool classes and between assemblages than was recognized in the classic
evolutionary framework. The new evidence implies that this standard sequence is based on
mixed collections and that unilineal evolutionary schemes of this type are not applicable to
the Aurignacian. Attribute analysis is now being used by other Western European
archaeologists to explore formal, functional, stylistic, and technological variability in
Aurignacian artifacts.(8 )
Brooks, Dan (Arizona) PREHISTORIC SOIL AND WATER CONTROL IN THE
AMERICAN SOUTHWEST: A CASE STUDY. Detailed studies of prehistoric soil and water
control techniques in the American Southwest are few in number. A system of 32 check
dams on Horse Fiats, a high plateau in Southeastern Utah, allowed the intensive
investigation of one such technique. Palynological, climatological, edaphic, and cultural data
were gathered through test trenching, intensive survey, and mapping. The hypothesized
agricultural function of the check dams was supported through the presence of Zea mays
pollen and a suitable macro- and micro-environment. Stratigraphic evidence suggested the
natural accumulation rather than the human transport of check dam soil. Palynological
analysis of the check dam fill provided an environmental reconstruction indicating a warmer
and drier period. The time span represented by the fill was determined to be between A.D.
1000 and A.D. 1300. Ten late Pueblo (Anasazi) sites were shown to be spatially and
temporally related to the system.(20)

Brooks, Sheilagh, and Richard H. Brooks (Nevada) PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY/
DEMOGRAPHY AND ARCHAEOLOGY. The usual model utilized to delineate archaeolos-
ically recovered skeletal populations is based on a physical stereotype derived from a series
of anthropometric indices or measurements. This model has been criticized by osteologists,
as well as archaeologists, since stereotypes do not allow for range of variability and the
anthropometric indices and measurements have little possibility of genetic interpretation. it
is proposed to introduce into Great Basin skeletal analysis a new model based on the
frequency of occurrence of a series of cranial and post-crania! discrete morphological traits.
These traits have been demonstrated to differentiate successfully archaeological skeletal
series in other geographical areas. A major consideration in their use is their potential for a
relatively simple genetic control, implying the possibility of such demographic interpreta-
tions as inbreeding, population movements, and contacts among prehistoric peoples of the
Great Basin.(5)

Browman, David L. (Washington) CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHIRIPA IN THE DEVELOP-

Titicaca, is important in understanding the development of the Tiwanaku Empire. At a time
contemporaneous with the Early Horizon of Peru, Chiripa begins exhibiting structural and
conceptual features found at the Tiwanaku capital some 1000 years later. Part of Tiwanaku
theology is rooted in themes found at Chiripa. The economic underpinning of the Tiwanaku
empire, the control of regional and long-distance trade, by means of long distance llama
trade caravans, may be developed as early as the Chiripa occupation in the area.(39)

Brown, Kenneth L. (Pennsylvania S) THE VALLEY OF GUATEMALA: A HIGHLAND
PORT-OF-TRADE. The paper discusses both the conquest model, in which Teotinuacan
controlled the Vailey of Guatemala during the Middle Classic, and the port-of-trade model,
in which Teotihuacan was one participant in long distance trading activities. Recent data
from other sites in the Valley demonstrate: (1) heavy influence from the Mayan area to the
north of San Antonio Frutal, and (2) a combination of northern Maya and Teotihuacan
traits in the architecture and artifacts at Solano. The conquest model is not capable of
explaining this data. The port-of-trade model predicts these findings with a high degree of
accuracy.(43)

Nicaragua, revealed a new large village site with what seem to be ceremonial structures and a
large cemetery associated. The long known site of Punto Zapote was revisited and, due to its
having been very recently cleared of jungle, was sketch mapped. It was seen to be much
farger than had been suspected, with residential areas in addition to the already known

Bryant, Vaughn M,, Jr. (Texas A&M) POLLEN ANALYSIS OF PREHISTORIC HUMAN
COPROLITES FROM FRIGHTFUL CAVE, COAHUILA, MEXICO. This report relates to
information derived from the pollen analysis of 47 human coprolite specimens recovered

23
, ;
the coprolites range from 7500 B.C.-A.D. 300 and are grouped into three major categories
based upon their provenience in the site. The data from these 47 human coprolites are used
to: (1) reconstruct prehistoric diet patterns, (2) predict specific periods of site occupancy,
and (3) distinguish between economic and background pollen types. In addition, the
coprolitic data are used for making limited generalizations concerning possible vegetational
changes in the Frightful Cave area during the past 9500 years.(16)

Button, Aileen F., and L. Lewis Johnson (Vassar) DEBITAGE ANALYSIS: ARCHAE-
OLOGICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL. In trying to understand the manufacturing trajectory
which Aguas Verdes knappers from Northern Chile followed in making points, it was
discovered that there was a strong positive correlation between a number of flake attribute
states. From analyzing the archaeological collection it was impossible to decide whether
these were due to technological constraints or to individual knapping patterns. Therefore,
we have made duplicates of the Aguas Verdes tools out of obsidian and the tuff used by the
Aguas Verdes knappers in order to produce similar debitage. Our analysis of this debitage,
produced by two workmen, indicates the reasons for attribute clustering in this industry.(3)
Byrd, Kathleen Mary (Florida State Museum) PREHISTORIC CARIBBEAN FISHING: A
ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS. Prehistoric Caribbean inhabitants had a wide range
of marine fish resources available for exploitation. Based on archaeologically recovered
faunal remains, however, not all these resources were equally utilized. Some faunal
assemblages show an abundance of one particular species or type of fish but a complete lack
of another kind. Since most species are restricted to a particular habitat and possess various
feeding habits and other behavioral traits, not all fishes are equally susceptible to a specific
fishing technique. As a result, different methods are employed to obtain different species.
The fish remains from several prehistoric sites are examined to postulate existing fishing
techniques from species’ hab‘tats and behavioral patterns.(2)
Callahan, Errett (Virginia Commonwealth) FLAKE REMOVAL SEQUENCE AND CUL-
TURAL INFERENCE. An intensive study of several Solutrean laurel leaf points from the
famous Volgu cache at Saone-et-Loire, France, reveals a unique and diagnostic approach to
the final stage of percussion biface reduction. A systematic reduction approach was found
to be present in varying degrees in the following categories: direction of flake sequence,
flake removal sequence per edge, per half, per face, per margin, and around the
cross-section. All conceivable variables of each of these categories were classified, coded, and
keyed to the archaeological units. In addition, a consistency scale was devised to determine
the degree of adherence to the hypothetical norm. Replicative experiments were performed
to test the feasibility of the apparent reduction system, and to determine the possibility of
making a true replica of a Solutrean laurel leaf using Known direct percussion knapping
procedures. The results of the analysis and replicative experiments were used to create a
model for separating imitation or approximation from replication and for inferring true
cultural affinity for any finished biface specimen with its supposed tradition.(3)

Canouts, Veletta (Arizona State Museum) MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES FOR EFFEC-
TIVE RESEARCH. The picture of salvage archaeologists struggling frantically to rescue one
last artifact as water laps at their feet is no tonger appropriate, Effective operationalism ot
archaeological theories, methods, and techniques, an issue generally ignored in the
discipline, is changing the picture within cultural resources management. This paper
discusses several management strategies that maximize research returns through a more
efficient use of time. These strategies related to three broad management principles: (1)
each stage of research should be a refinement of the preceding stage; (2) research continuity
should insure that the project is independent of a single researcher's commitment; and (3)
research should be utilized as a cumulative base upon which subsequent research projects
can build. Examples from the author’s experience in project direction illustrate these
principles.(9)

FOR RECOVERING FISH REMAINS. Comparisons were made between fish faunas
recovered from entire excavation units and sorted in the field by the excavators and fish
faunas from colurmn samples recovered from the same units and examined in the laboratory
with aid of microscopic examination. The results indicated that the smalier column samples
provided adequate control for defining the number of species utilized and often surpassed
the whole unit analyses by showing the presence of smaller individuals or species not
recovered from the larger units. Microscopic examination of small samples appeared to
provide a much needed addition to the commonly utilized methods of sampling for
archaeological fish faunas.(11)

Chapman, Richard (New Mexico) THE SOUTHWEST. The present state of stone too/
analysis within the American Southwest is best characterized as a ‘‘shot-gun"’ approach to a
variety of specific problems concerning human technological behavior. Overt concern with
ideational determinants of tool manufacture, as reflected in reconstruction of ‘'cultural-
historical"' sequences, has served until recently as a primary problem orientation. Within the
last decade questions of tool function have been asked with increasing frequency. Analytical
methodologies in this regard have generally focused upon assemblages as units of analysis,
with emphasis being placed upon microscopic examination of wear patterns, and their
covariation with tool morphology. Specific problems approached through this assemblage
analysis include isolation of differential tool use activities both within site locations, and
between site locations within regions. Non-ideational questions of tool manufacture are
being approached through both tool and debitage analysis. Productive ongoing research is
being directed toward isolation of changes in reduction strategy Imposed by distance of site
location of tool use from material source location, and evolutionary changes in subsistence
strategy of human populations within a region. Definition of material source locations
within the Southwest is being attempted at present largely through observational criteria,
although neutron activation has been employed successfully with respect to obsidian
materials. Major needs critical to further research in prehistoric technological behavior
include an effective structure of communication among lithic specialists, and a theory of
human technological behavior.(42)
Chartkoff, Joseph L. (Michigan S) GREAT QUESTIONS AND OPAQUE HYPOTHESES:
TESTING INADEQUATE ALTERNATE EXPLANATIONS FOR AGRICULTURAL
ORIGINS, There is often an inverse relationship between the scope of a question and the
precision of possible answers, yet the pursuit of significant gains in knowledge draws
attention to the most general questions. Explaining the origins of agriculture is such a
problem. This study focuses on the question of why there was an adoption of food
production technology in the Near East around 8000 B.C. It considers a number of possibly
adequate and not-so-adequate proffered explanations and discusses how some tests of the
alternate hypotheses were conducted. It views gain in knowledge as changes In the degrees
of confidence with which any given proposed explanation is regarded as true or false. It
argues that confidence levels can be changed even allowing for inadequacies in both
hypotheses and test data.(4)
Cheek, Annetta (Tulsa) HISTORIC RECORDS AND THE STUDY OF ACCULTURATION:
A CASE STUDY. The site of Quiburi (Arizona EF:8:1) was excavated by DiPeso (1953)

Spanish presidio, dating A.D. 1692-98, A.D. 1704-62, and A.D. 1772-89, respectively. Other
authorities have questioned this interpretation. DiPeso’s report of the assemblages is
compared to historic information in an attempt to identify the nature of the site and to
elucidate the course of acculturation of aboriginal populations by European peoples.(20)

This is approximately the same time that there was a shift in emphasis away from
monumental sculpture In the Oimec area. It is suggested that the shift from monumental
sculpture to the use of jade objects and green stone pavements is essentially a substitution of
one ceremonial medium for another.(43)

HOLOCENE OPEN SITE ON THE SANTANDER COAST, NORTH CENTRAL SPAIN.
With the aid of a computer, an nth order nearest neighbor analysis is performed on classes of
lithic data from Liencres, an open site on the Spanish coast. Significance of the degree of
clustering measured by the statistic is assessed using the standard normal variable. Hanson's
(1974) modification of Whalion's (1974) method for determining spatial association of
artifact types is then employed to define use areas within the site. The so-called
““shared-tool"’ method is thought to provide a better measure of the association among
objects than the “shared area" approach originally advocated by Whallon. Use areas so
defined are subsequently compared statistically using contingency table analyses. A
multiple, stepwise discriminant analysis evaluates the adequacy of criteria used in group
formation.(41)
Clark, J. Desmond (California-Berkeley) RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN
EASTERN ETHIOPIA. During the 1974 winter season work was carried out at the south
end of the Afar Rift and base of the Southeast Plateau. in the west (Garibaldi crater and
Lake Basaka areas) an important series of foams and vertisoils was found containing a
sequence of ‘Middle Stone Age" working fioors, overlain by surfaces with a developing
sequence of assemblages in the East African blade tool tradition. At Lake Basaka occupation
sites with three successive stages of this blade tradition were found associated with former
high lake levels, the earliest dating to ca 11500 B.P.; burials and fauna were associated with
the second of these stages and a stone bowl with the third. Aladi Springs near Afdem
yielded a late *‘Middie Stone Age” stratified beneath a small blade assemblage dated to ca
11000 B.P. Porc Epic Cave, Dire Dawa, was revisited and re-excavated yielding a ‘Middle
Stone Age” contained within breccia sealed by a massive stalagmite curtain. The results of
the 1975 season on the Southeast Plateau are also reported briefly and comparisons made
with the sequence in the Rift.(36)
Clausen, Carl J. (Texas Historical Comm) and H. K. Brooks (Florida) THE CLIMATIC AND
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE FLORIDA WARM MINERAL SPRINGS
EARLY MAN SITE. Underwater investigations at Warm Mineral Springs in coastal Sarasota
County, Florida, carried out intermittently from 1959 to early 1972, have provided
evidence of the presence of man in that area approximately 10,000 years ago. A sample of
wood from a level of stratified sediment on a ledge in the Spring in which a human vertebra
was discovered, provided a radiocarbon date of 8310 B.C. (10260+190 B.P., Gak-3998).
Wood samples from the next two superior 10 cm levels of the test also returned dates in
excess Of 10,000 radiocarbon years old. These dates are supported by three dates on
charcoal samples from the same zone secured independently by Brooks. A second human
bone, a fragmentary Ilium was recovered a few centimeters outside the test in sediments of
similar age. These specimens, those of a child approximately six years of age, may prove to
be the earliest, closely dated, human remains so far discovered in North America. Of
importance far surpassing the early man find at this spring is the detailed record of
environmental conditions for this period preserved in these sediments through apparently
unique circumstances of water chemistry and spring morphology. Ten thousand year old
leaves, budding twigs, nuts, pine cones, pollen, and even algal spores, as well as invertebrate
and vertebrate remains, the latter especially well represented, ranging from fish and
amphibian to man, are present in the lower zone of the sediment in astonishing profusion
and condition. Preservation of these organic materials is primarily attributable to the general
absence of dissolved oxygen in the conate water filling the spring and the now constant year
round water temperature of approximately 30.5 C in the upper portions of the spring. A
preliminary analysis of the evidence amassed during this research indicates that somewhat
cooler and drier, perhaps on occasion arid, conditions than exist at present in this area
prevailed during this early period. Physical and geochemical evidence bearing on the local
climatic condition and possible implications for climatic variation over the southern half of
the North American continent during this period are discussed.(38)

Clutton-Brock, Juliet (British Museum) A ZOOLOGIST'S APPROACH TO PREHISTORY
IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Certain straightforward zoological questions are posed for the
mammatogist Who undertakes to work on the animal remains from an archaeological site. In
unravelling and analyzing the resuits of this work the zoologist is tempted, and indeed
expected, to broaden his subject and to speculate on the socio-economics of the human
26
, population whose food remains he is investigating. The modern archaeologist expects the
animal bone report to include comments on site-catchment analysis, slaughter patterns, the
relative amount of meat provided by different groups of livestock, and the old, thorny
problem of the minimum number of individual animals represented. The question is asked,
and it is hoped that discussion will follow, on whether the zoologist can really provide valid
answers to these topics or whether it might not be more rewarding to concentrate on
restricted zoological problems, In the Middle East, for example, the correct identification of
sheep and goat bones and specific determinations of the remains of gazelle and equids are
not often attempted. To tackle these basic problems could be most rewarding for the
implications that may be deduced on the past distributions of wild species, on biotope
changes and the effects of hunting by man, and on the micro-evolution of the species
concerned.(24, 25)

Cole, David L. (Oregon) DIRTY SHAME ROCKSHELTER, MALHEUR COUNTY,
OREGON: EXCAVATION AND CULTURAL FEATURES. Dirty Shame Rockshelter,
located in the southeastern corner of Oregon, was excavated by a University of Oregon field
crew in 1973. The site was chosen for excavation because of its potential for revealing an
upland riverine adaptation in an area occupied by Great Basin peoples. Excellent state of
preservation and expectations of evidence of long, reasonably continuous occupation were
considerations in the research proposal! that won National Science Foundation support. The
site was excavated, as possible, according to stratigraphic divisions. Three sedimentary
divisions were: Stratum 1, an accumulation of very dry occupational debris dating from
after 4000 6.C. and somewhat obfuscated by underground burning and subsequent settling;
Stratum 2, a deposit of ash and silts, not as dusty as Stratum 1, and with diminished
preservation, dating between 5800 B.C. and 4000 8.C.; Stratum 3, silts and water taid
deposits holding mostly non-perishable artifacts, having C-14 dates of 6955 B.C. and 7550
B.C. Stratigraphic divisions within Stratum 1 were based upon cultural features including a
thatched hut dating from around A.D. 200, and earlier layers with quantities of sandats,
textiles and other artifacts and cultural debris. Divisions within Strata 2 and 3 were based
primarily upon arbitrary excavation units.(17)

6xamined. Analogy with experimentally derived correlates between knapping behavior and
artifact attributes permitted interpretation of Solutrean flaking technology. Behaviors
concerning material acquisition, initial reduction, primary trimming, secondary trimming,
refurbishing, and disposal are described for each Solutrean period. Preliminary examination
of debitage from Pataud: 3, 4, and 5 (Perigordian VI, Noaillian, and Perigordian IV,
respectively) provides evidence of contrasting technological strategies applied to the same
natural resource base of chippable stone. The adaptive significance of these strategies is

Cumbaa, Stephen L. (Florida) COASTAL RESOURCE UTILIZATION AND CROSS-
CULTURAL DIETARY CHANGE IN THE SPANISH COLONIAL PERIOD, Through a
combination of factors including historical accident, political and military design,
communications, and failure to successfully exploit interior regions, the focus of the
Spanish colonists in Florida and the Caribbean area was on the coastal areas for habitation
as well as food gathering and production. Spanish soldiers and friars were not trained
farmers and depended primarily on imported provisions, domestic animals originally
brought from Spain, and on trade with native peoples for New World cultigens, wild game,
fish, and shelifish. Aboriginal food habits and lifestyles changed as well, becoming most
marked in mestizo households. Detailed dietary analysis gleaned from documents and
archaeologically recovered materials enables comparison of energy flows between groups of
differing social status in the Spanish Colonial period.(2)

, Cummings, Calvin R. (Nati Park Service) SUMMARY OF NATIONAL PARK SERVICE
UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES. The National Park Service has been
developing a comprehensive program for dealing with all phases of its underwater
archaeological responsibilities. The Service is involved at several levels in dealing with
submerged cultural resources, both in its own Park areas and in an advisory and review role
with other agencies and institutions. This paper attempts to outline these different functions
and illustrate the way in which the service is seeking to complement and align its resource
management responsibilities with pure research objectives. It is shown how this overall
approach to underwater archaeology will assume a problem-oriented direction and produce
meaningful data in an anthropological sense rather than merely help document unique
historical events. Finally, the paper presents examples of ways that underwater archaeology
can play a part in ‘total anthropological"’ research designs for given park areas.(38)

Dalton, George (Northwestern) ABORIGINAL ECONOMIES IN STATELESS SOCIETIES:
INTERACTION SPHERES. The original formulations of potiatch and kula (by Boas and
Malinowski) were either misleading or incomplete. Recent work, such as A. Strathern, The
Rope of Moka," and A. Rosman and P. Rubel, “Feasting with Mine Enemy," provides more
convincing Interpretations of the meaning and importance of ‘ceremonial exchanges,"* and
allows one to show the connections between ceremonial exchanges and basic political and
economic structures of those societies that had ceremonial exchanges. In all this, several
distinctions are crucial: (1) the distinction between “aboriginal” or ‘‘Pre-colonial”’ societies
and these societies after they became subject to American or European colonial control; (2)
the distinction between “‘stateless’’ societies and those tribal kingdoms and peasant states
that had central government; (3) it is also necessary to understand the distinction between
“primitive valuables’’ (e.g., kula bracelets), ‘primitive money" (e.g., cowrie shells used in
market place purchases), and ‘‘cash’’ (modern money such as dollars and francs). The
important characteristics of aboriginal economies in stateless societies that lead to the
formation of what Radcliffe-Brown called ‘relationships of alliance’’ with outside
groups—which, In turn, create what Struever calls “interaction spheres’’~are: (a) small
groups (lineages, lineage clusters, sub-clans) of varying size and varying access to food and
resources; (b) the vital roles—political, economic, social—of corporate descent groups; (c)
leadership roles: Big-men, lineage heads, sub-clan leaders; (0) primitive valuables; (e) feud,
raid, revenge, death compensation, warfare with enemies, and dispute settiement among
allies. There are four networks of relations of alliance, These are peaceful and special
relationships between corporate descent groups (among whom non-lethal dispute settlement
is the rule, and between whom material transactions and transfers of women in marriage
constitute necessary parts of alliance). These networks or interaction spheres are: (1)
warfare alliances, in raiding, feud, revenge, and peace-making; (2) marriage alliances and
bridewealth: (3) ceremonial exchanges, such as kula and potiatch, which, aboriginally, were
done only among allies; (4) ordinary external trade, usually by gift-exchange, occasionally
by market exchange.(18)
Davis, Hester A. (Arkansas Archeological Survey) THE PUBLIC AND CULTURAL
RESOURCE LEGISLATION: REACTION AND RESPONSIBILITY. By and large, the great
American public is blissfully unaware of laws which affect or protect archaeological and
historic resources, except for the possible exception of the 1906 Antiquities Act. They are
somewhat more aware of specific preservation projects, particularily those that affect
restoration of historic homes. Misinterpretation and/or misunderstanding has often resulted
from uninformed interest. However, a large number of non-archaeologists and non-historians
are interpreting the laws in light of their own needs and requirements—as with federal
agencies—or to their own advantage—as with American Indians. More awareness by more
people of the potential of the laws for use and abuse would considerably aid in preservation
of information and resources. The reaction is generally uninformed; the responsibility is
both ours and theirs.(19)

distributions of artifacts require at least two prerequisites: (1) identification of the probable
former use of artifacts entering into the analysis, and (2) formulation of at least general
models for the expected distributional partitions. The results of distributional analyses in
which the above two prerequisites were satisfied are described. The archaeological data used
in the analyses were excavated from a P-I/I| Pueblo located in the Upper Little Colorado
region of Arizona.(35)
Dibble, David S. (Texas-Austin) THE INFIERNO PHASE: EVIDENCE FOR A LATE
PREHISTORIC OCCUPATION IN THE NORTHEASTERN CHIHUAHUAN DESERT
MARGINS. Direct archaeological evidence of late prehistoric occupation in the lower
Pecos-Devils River drainages (roughly coterminous with the present northeastern
Chihuahuan Desert margin) has been limited. Most of the data available from the region are
interpreted as indicating general continuity in adaptive patterning throughout middle-to-late
prehistoric occupations. Recently, however, an extensive site in the lower Pecos valley has
been investigated and is hypothesized to reflect a late prehistoric occupation in the region
by hunting groups of significant size; further, a hypothesis regarding a late period intrusion
into the area by Athabascan speakers is presented on the basis of the new archaeological
evidence.(22)
Dillehay, Tom D. (Texas-Austin) UPSTAIRS LOOKING DOWN: A GEOGRAPHIC
PERSPECTIVE OF INCA ACTIVITY IN THE CHILLON VALLEY, PERU. Recent
investigations in the coastal and lower sierra zones of the Chillon Valley have led to a
different theoretical approach to understanding the nature of Inca political and economic
control of the central coast. Extensive fieldwork has shown that the region was settied
unevenly by the Inca; a more intensive state occupation of the lower sierra zone is indicated,
The supposition is therefore advanced that state control of the valley was managed froma
geographic-polltical locus in this highland area. Speculation on the nature of the relationship
between major sites in the valley is presented within the context of the benefits of such a
locus and its apparent influence on the proximate coastal zone.(31)
Dincauze, Dean F. (Massachusetts) LITHIC ANALYSIS IN THE NORTHEAST. Application
of lithic analytical techniques has been sporadic in the Northeast, with consequently uneven
results. Within the area there has been no standardization of methods or aims, so that results
of even the best studies have lacked comparability. Historical and functional reasons for this
situation will be briefly examined. Lithic analytical techniques have been applied to
problems of culture-unit definition, artifact recognition, and within-site activity Gescrip-
tions. Attention has been devoted to raw material distribution patterns; there is growing
interest in such studies as new techniques appear capable of dealing with the extraordinary
diversity of lithic materials in the area. Results to date, major areal problems, and future
directions of research activity in the area will be summarized.(4 2)
Di Peso, Charlies C. (Amerind Fdn) PREHISTORIC CASAS GRANDES HYDRAULIC
CONTROLS OF THE CASAS GRANDES VALLEY. In the mid-eleventh century, the
people of the Casas Grandes Valley of northwest Chihuahua, Mexico, implanted a
semi-complex hydraulic system which involved the control of the entire Casas Grandes
upland dendritic pattern. This engineering feat permitted the expansion and ultimate
exploitation of the indigenous population and its territory by the technologically advanced
Mesoamerican puchteca (traders).(22)
Doelle, William (Arizona State Museum) MAXIMIZING SCARCE RESOURCES: A
QUANTITATIVE STRATEGY FOR INTERPRETING NON-SITE ARCHAEOLOGICAL
MANIFESTATIONS. This paper discusses a practical, quantitative method for carrying out
archaeological investigations in areas where artifactual evidence of past human behavior is
29
, not of sufficient density to merit designation as a site. This approach is especially
appropriate in dealing with problems relating to past subsistence strategies. It emphasizes
collection of quantitative data on vegetation and other environmental variables, while it also
assures near 100% recovery of artifactual materials within the area sampled. Discussion
focuses On results from a contract project from the Hohokam area of Arizona.(9)

FORDIAN NORTHEAST. Symbolism and ritual behavior from the ethnohistorical
literature of northeastern North America are examined for their relationship to the physical
archaeology of the Late Woodland Collins complex in east-central Illinois. Life and death
and the theme of continuity of life are discussed with special attention to cedar, sun, and
sun-referenced directional symbolism. Attention is called to the apparently deep cultural
roots of the symbolic behavior manifested in a late prehistoric horizon not usually
associated in the mind with ceremonialism.(10)
Dragoo, Donald W. (Carnegie Museum) EARLY LITHIC CULTURES OF EASTERN
NORTH AMERICA, Research in Eastern North America during the past 20 years has
produced a wealth of information on early cultural complexes present in the New
World during and after the last Glacial period. The evidence is so extensive that there
can be little doubt that the East was a major center of early occupation and
subsequent cultural elaboration. The presence of complexes containing a variety of
pebble and core tools similar to those of upper Paleolithic manifestations of the Old
World indicates the presence of man prior to 30,000 years ago. Conventional Paleo-
indian culture as represented by the Clovis fluted point hunters is present in great
quantities at many sites representing the full range of development in time and
typology. If the quantity of the remains may be taken as a reliable indicator of
population size, the targest concentration of man in the New World prior to 10,000
years ago occurred in the East. From the late Early Lithic complexes of the East there
developed several regional traditions adapted to various environmental situations in the
Archaic period following the final retreat of the continental ice sheet.(33, 34)
Druss, Mark (Virginia Commonwealth) CHIUCHIU COMPLEX: PHASE SEQUENCE, A
23-phase sequence, based on 8 radiocarbon dates, 21 stratified components, and a 43
feature occurrence seriation, is presented for the Preceramic Chiuchiu complex, ca.
2700-1600 68.C., northern Chile. Elements of the seriation include projection point and
boring tool attributes, the latter being sensitive indicators of temporal change. Attributes
rather than types were used to avoid the inherent theoretical problems of typing and to
maximize the information potential of the collections. The sequence attempts micro-
chronological contro! for the 88 components of the complex. This order of precision jis
deemed necessary for studies of the settlement and subsistence systems of hunter-
gatherers.(39)
DuBois, Robert L. (Oklahoma) RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE ARCHAEO-
MAGNETIC DATING PROGRAM. Archaeomagnetism uses magnetic measurements made
on specimens collected from kilns, hearths, fired floors, and Wallis from archaeological
features as a basis for dating. Eight specimens, each consisting of a 3 cm cylinder of baked
clay material encased in an oriented plaster cube, constitute a single sample for age deter-
mination. Since the method was developed for the Southwestern United States some ten
years ago, the techniques of collecting and processing the samples have undergone a series of
modifications. The scope of the present archaeomagnetic program, including the present
procedur@s used in obtaining and processing the samples as well as the criteria used in
developing a polar data representational curve for a new region, is discussed. The present
results from the Southwest suggest that dates can be obtained for most sites with a precision
of from +10 years to #30 years at the 95% confidence level. As the magnetic field of the
| earth is not a simple dipole field, the location of the north virtual geomagnetic pole varies
| according to the position on the surface of the earth from Which data are collected. This
feature of the geomagnetic field suggests that separate archaeomagnetic polar data curves
will have to be constructed for each major region studied. The length of laboratory time for
the development of archaeomagnetic master curves depends on several factors: (1) obtaining
numerous archaeomagnetic samples for the delineation of the polar curve; (2) obtaining a
series of samples that are firmly cross-dated by other absolute chronological methods, and
thereby providing calendrical points of reference along the curve; and (3) obtaining a num-
ber of samples from different localities within the region that can be used to cross-check
internal consistency. For some regions, data from other areas may be extrapolated and
| helpful in establishing the general framework for the curves of a new region, The current
state of development of the polar data representational curves for the Midcontinent, eastern
United States, Mesoamerican and Peruvian areas is discussed. Some of the limitations of the
archaeomagnetic dating technique also are discussed, including the effects of secular varia-
tion on the earth's magnetic field on the development of the polar data representational
curve, as well as the effects of ‘lightning strikes’’ or other contaminations on the resuits
obtained from samples. The current solutions to these problems are explained.(44)
Ducos, Pierre (Centre de Recherche d'Ecologie Humaine et de Prehistoire) THE USE OF
STATISTICAL METHODS IN THE ANALYSIS OF FAUNAL MATERIAL FROM THE
MIDDLE EAST Investigations of the fauna of the Middie East are made largely with the use
30
, of statistical methods. The different working hypotheses, explicit and inexplicit, are dis-
cussed, in particular: (1) the non-pertinence of morphological characteristics in the deter-
mination of wild and domestic; (2) correlations between quantitative aspects of osteological
collections and techniques used by man in the acquisition of animals; and (3) the envision-
ing Of bone assemblages as statistical samples. These three hypotheses justify the utilization
of statistical methods. The terms of the application of these methods are also discussed,
more for the elaboration of the statistics (reasons for the non-utilization of the number of
minimum individual statistic) than for their interpretation: determination of the role of
chance or choice, the significant value of the two, the interdependence of the given
statistics. Finally, it is discussed which of these methods do not claim to be applied rigidly
to the study of collections, but more a point of view according to which the collection is
approached. There follows a scientific method which it is necessary to constantly critique
and perfect.(24, 25)
Duffield, Lathel F. (Kentucky) MODERN BISON IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.
Modern bison ranged east of the Mississippi River at least two different times. The first was
during the tate Pleistocene and the second after A.D. 1550. The second arrival was
characterized by a major and rapid range expansion that occurred within a 100 year period.
This latest expansion may be related to the onset of the Neo-Boreal Climatic episode (A.D.
1550-1890).(27)

SOUTHWESTERN ALASKA. In 1973 and 1974 work was resumed by the University of
Oregon in order to complete knowledge of the distribution of occupation in the Naknek
drainage system. Results suggest that people of Arctic Small Tool tradition were
substantially confined to the upper drainage; people of Norton tradition inhabited the upper
and middie drainage areas; people of Thule tradition occupied the upper, middie, and lower
drainage. Exploratory work at a site on the Bering Sea coast ten miles from the mouth of
the Naknek River yielded evidence of a side-notched point complex apparently radiocarbon
dated at about 3000 B.C., and an early blade complex securely radiocarbon dated to just
after6000 B.C.(28)
Dunbar, Helene R, (SUNY Binghamton) CHEMICAL AND METALLOGRAPHIC ANALY-

site was discovered in 1967 when a contractor began removing gravel from a knoll in the
Susquehanna Vailey near Nichols, New York, as part of the construction of the Route 17
Expressway. During two seasons of salvage excavations at this mutti-component site, 175
burials and hundreds of pit features were located. Chemical and metallographic analyses of
selected copper objects recovered during excavations confirm the presence of two classes of
copper artifacts: archaic trade goods forged from native copper, and simple ornaments cut
out and forged from early European trade copper that was originally smelted.(44)

consists of a 170 mile long right-of-way, of which one-third was surveyed. The relationships
among tool assemblage types, defined by a classificatory model, and locational types with
respect to prehistoric food resources are discussed. Also, brief studies concerning quarry

Ebert, James |., and Robert K. Hitchcock (New Mexico) CLAUDE LEVI-STRAUSS AND
THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF PREHISTORIC STRUCTURES. Edmund Leach recently
suggested that archaeologists are today occupied to their detriment with the pursuit of facile
functional explanations, and that their salvation will be the eventual acceptance of a
structuralist stance. Is this in fact the case, or have archaeologists been structuralists all
along? The basic tenets and products of structuralism are critically compared with those of
traditional and new archaeology; it is argued that mysticism and mentalism—which may be
very useful to the contemporary ethnologist’s purposes—have no place in a true science. (27)

STUDY OF SETTLEMENTS AND LAND USE IN THE COLORADO FOOTHILLS. An
archaeological survey of the proposed Two Forks Dam and Reservoir in the eastern foothills
of the Colorado Rocky Mountains has revealed a settlement pattern of base camps and
limited activity sites that span a period from Early Archaic to historic times. Two models
are constructed to account for the nature of these prehistoric settlement and subsistence
systems indicating that the location of particular types of sites and land use remained
unchanged through time. The first model is based on ethnographic analogy developed from
the ethnohistoric accounts of Ute occupation of the Colorado mountains and foothills, while
the second model is derived from the plant and animal ecology of the foothills study
district. Tests for the assumption of cultural stability through time include functional
analyses of stone tool assemblages from each recorded site and comparison of site
distributions by time periods and environmental setting.(40)

The Bla Mesa Archaeological Project, sponsored by Peabody Coal Company, has been
conducting survey and excavation on the northern part of Black Mesa, on the Navajo and
Hopi Indian Reservations in northern Arizona, each field season since 1967. This research
has permitted the development of a conceptual phase system and temporal framework for
the Black Mesa Anasazi from Basketmaker !|, here dating perhaps as early as 630 B.C.,, into
late Pueblo III, with a primary occupation culminating ca. A.D. 1100-1150. More
importantly, with the assistance of geologists from the U.S. Geological Survey, paleo-en-
vironmental conditions have been reconstructed and environmental change has been
correlated with the phase system and with changes In Anasazi settlement patterns and social
organization. These aspects are discussed together with hypotheses regarding the rapid

, Fagan, John L. (Corps of Engineers) THE PLATEAU AND NORTHWEST COAST. In the
past lithic analysis in the Plateau and Northwest Coast has focused on projectile point
typologies which have been used to develop local and regional chronologies. More recently,
and through the influence of special schools and classes being offered in prehistoric
technology and experimental archaeology, emphasis has been placed on experimentation as
a means of studying human behavior as expressed through lithic remains. Included in these
studies are such topics as stage analysis in the manufacture of stone tools, replication of
specific tool types, wear pattern analysis, examination of quarries and workshops,
experimentation with heat treatment, obsidian hydration research, spectographic analysis
and trace element studies of raw materials, and studies of trade routes and distribution
systems. These focuses of study, coupled With ethnographic information on tool production
and use, should further our understanding of prehistoric human behavior in the
Northwest.(42)

considered the major technological component of Northwest Coast culture, can be studied
in an archaeological context. The current study deals with the identification of the wood
species utilized in the manufacture of specific categories of wooden artifacts by these
aboriginal people. Evidence indicates that they selectively utilized a wide range of available

particular type of artifact. They were well aware of the potential of their environment, and

Since we have hardly coped with problems of sampling error, proofs based on biased
samples oftdata will hardly be compelling. Similarly, archaeologists ought to worry about
producing some legitimate processual explanations before they become too exercised about
rejecting them.(4)

occupation in Samoa. Pottery, a common marker of West Polynesian early period, was not
found. Two fortified ridge sites were also mapped and tested providing two dates to suggest

300 (10 specimens). Adaptation to Broad Spectrum Resource Utilization is demonstrated
by the eating of 37 varieties of seeds, 9 non-seed plant varieties, insects, reptiles, birds and
eggs, and mammals including bones. Typical Desert Archaic food preparation techniques
were practiced: parching and milling of small seeds, preparation of cacti by burning off
spines; roasting of roots, tubers and cactus pads; preparation of bone meal or cakes by
pounding or milling. Culture change is indicated by an expansion of the food base after
2000 B.C. A possible climatic trend from more mesic to more xeric conditions from bottom
to top is also indicated. Microscopic search for parasites and ova was negative.(16)

Gerald, Rex E. (Texas-El Paso) DROUGHT-CORRELATED CHANGES IN TWO PRE-
HISTORIC PUEBLO COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHEASTERN ARIZONA. Droughts lasting
two or more years frequently lead to famine among horticulturalists of tribal level societies.
Under the stress of decreasing nutrition, human behavior shifts from the normal altruistic
patterns toward egocentric ones. As a result, several changes in the social system are
predictable: Competition for food resources will reduce the friendly social contacts between
communities; competition for food resources between households within the community
will bring about a reduction in social interaction; household size will be reduced because of
the premature deaths of the elderly and the young; stored foodstuffs will be conserved more
diligently; wild foods will be utilized more intensively; and non-subsistence activities will be
minimized. These changes were postulated and deduced hypotheses tested utilizing data
from two small, sequentially occupied Salado sites in southeastern Arizona. The Davis
Ranch site was colonized by a group of virilocally resident males and their families during a
relatively moist period in the latter part of the thirteenth century. As the environment
began to desiccate, the site was fortified with a perimeter wall and was tater abandoned in
favor of the nearby, more readily defended, Reeve Ruin location where the perimeter
defensive wall was constructed before the protected dweilings were completed. If it is
assumed that wall construction techniques furnish evidence of male activity patterns and
that ceramic design element types relate to fermale behavior, it is possible to explain data
recovered at Reeve Ruin by hypothesizing that the site was occupied by a lineage of males
practicing avunculocal residence and intermarrying relatively regularly with two nearby
communities in a pattern consistent with patrilateral cross-cousin marriage. Avunculocally
resident lineage males would be well suited to the defense of field plots and food stores
from neighboring groups made covetous in an environment of drought-reduced carrying
capacity. Under different assumptions most of the Reeve Ruin data can also be explained by
the assumption of endogamy and either matrilocal or patrilocal residence with bilateral
cross-cousin marriage, but the tow population density that usually accompanies this
marriage practice is not indicated.(20)

Clacton-on-Sea, Essex, has produced more than 1200 artifacts, more than half of which are

woodiand habitat; the pollen assernblage from the mar! layer suggests a Hoxnian age (Hol)
for the industry. At Hoxne, Suffolk, two stratigraphically distinct Acheulian industries, in
part in situ, have been excavated in interglacial lake muds and in an overlying, largely
fluviatile, Upper Sequence, with indications of climatic deterioration.(8)

Goldstein, Lynne (Northwestern) SPATIAL ORGANIZATION IN MORTUARY ANALY-
SIS: MISSISSIPPIAN CEMETERY EXAMPLES. Examination of prehistoric social organiza-
tion by means of mortuary site analysis has become extremely popular in the last few years.
Most of these analyses dwell on the differential distribution of artifacts among burials, or
other obvious indicators of social position. This study employs traditional indicators of
social status, but focuses on the spatial organization of these indicators and of the burials
themselves in mortuary sites. By examining spatial relationships among and between burials,
the interrelation of individuals within the group can be more fully understood. Moss and
Schild cemeteries, two Mississippian sites in the lower Illinois Valley, are used as
examples.(29)
Goodyear, Albert C. (South Carolina) CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGY WITHIN THE
HIGHWAY CONTEXT: AN EXAMPLE FROM SOUTH CAROLINA. The general problem
of contract archaeology making meaningful contributions to wider American archaeology in
areas of method and theory are reviewed and the case of highway contract archaeology as
approached in South Carolina is described, The need for written, explicit research designs
are discussed particularly in light of ‘*small-scale’’ contract areas. A consideration of
contract archaeology within highway corridors is offered which treats the primary
limitation, that of transect sampling which substantially nullifies a true regional analysis;
additionally considered are the good points of probiem-oriented highway work which
include culture-ecological analysis, geographically extensive investigations, a de facto
multi-stage research strategy, certain potential theoretical and methodological contributions,
and its greatest strength that of intensive intra-site analysis. The need and functions of a
general design for the highway program are discussed which will provide data comparability
and reliability for long-range research strategies. The primary goal of the South Carolina
highway research design, that of systematic exploration and reconstruction of extinct
behaviors represented by highway intercepted sites, is reviewed. Sampling procedures and
data types are considered in view of their relevancy to this primary theoretical goal. Several
domains or targets for data recovery are offered which can be expected to aid in the
achievement of behavioral reconstructions for a variety of ‘‘site-types’’ of all phases in
prehistory of the state.(9)
Gorman, Frederick J. (Boston) THE ROLE OF INFORMATION THEORY IN EXPAND-
ING ARCHAEOLOGICAL INQUIRY. The logical status of current information-theoretic

- analyses of prehistoric cultural systems having unknown (black box) organization is
discussed. Two of the more apparent consequences which the theory of uncertainty and the
identity preservation of information bits have for expanding research are examined. Does an
uncertainty limit theorem exist which bounds articulation of information bearing elements
of hypothesis, data collection and analysis in a research design? Does the stable identity of
information permit construction of a relativity theorem to account for changing relations
between permanent--and temporary linear culture system behaviors in a chronology of
archaeological cultures?(23)

Grady, Mark (Arizona State Museum) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY AND THE FUTURE

aware of the fact that resource management programs are more economical than salvage
approaches. Archaeological management data provided during terrain alteration planning
reduce the costly expense of mitigation. Most of these data are obtained through
archaeological survey. Techniques for the maximization of survey information potential
relating to research requirements and sponsor needs are considered.(9)

, Grayson, Donald K. (BLM) PALEOENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE
VERTEBRATE FAUNA FROM THE DIRTY SHAME ROCKSHELTER. Approximately
3000 bones and bone fragments, representing some 25 species of mammals, birds, and fish,
have been identified from the Dirty Shame Rockshelter to date. Of these identified
elements, the great majority—over 95%—are mammalian, the bulk of these pertaining to two
species, Sylvilagus nuttallii (Nuttall’s Cottontail) and Marmota flaviventris (Yellow-bellied
Marmot). The pattern of distribution of these remains across the six stratigraphic zones of
Dirty Shame allows insight into the genera! nature of past environments in the immediate
area of the site, and indicates that the upper Owyhee drainage during the middie Holocene
could not have been particularly hot and dry. A review of published studies which provide
information on Holocene climates in the northern Great Basin and adjacent areas indicates
that no general sequence of Holocene climatic changes can as yet be confirmed for this large
region, and that properly cross-verified climatic sequences for smaller areas within the
northern Great Basin proper are lacking. A program of archaeological research which would
provide such a sequence is suggested and briefly outlined.(17)

which could result in such rankings are discussed. Suggested intersite relationships are
discussed as well as relationships with other Middie Woodland Hopewell sites.(45)

Green, James P. (Washington S) THE GREAT BASIN AND CALIFORNIA, Great Basin
lithic studies have developed in association with culture-historical reconstruction. Cuitural
chronologies based on projectile point typologies have traditionally overshadowed other
avenues of lithic research. The emphasis on projectile points as fossiles directeurs has
inhibited analysis and definition of related lithic assemblages. Analytical studies have been
directed toward verifying formal types; however, the technological parameter has only
recently been considered. Core and biface reduction systems together with manufacturing
sequences are growing areas of investigation. Functional and wear pattern studies are few
but are potential sources of much information. Elemental analysis of obsidian has produced
data on source variation and sampling. Libraries of source areas and composition are aiding
in the fingerprinting of site material. Research in this area is contributing to the elucidation
of trade’ networks and regional settlement systems. Obsidian hydration studies linked with
elemental analysis, and solid chronologies are becoming more productive. Lithic research is
in its infancy in the Great Basin. Collections are present from many areas of the region
which could serve as lithic corpora, Lithic technology is an important tool in understanding
prehistoric cultural developments in the Great Basin.(42)

Coahuila, Mexico from the late sixteenth through eighteenth centuries. Several
archaeological reports concern the prehistory of the region, particularly Taylor (1966),
Varner (1967), and Heartfield (1975). With these basic data and additional supporting
materials, a model of Indian settlement and utilization of the Laguna Mayran and its
environs is presented. This model is used to formulate hypotheses about Proto-historic
times, define archaeological problems and formulate research objectives. Particular emphasis
is placed on correlation of ethnographic and archaeological data and the nature and origin of
historic aboriginal populations in Southwest Coahuila.(16)
Greengo, Robert E. (Washington) PREHISTORIC ARCHITECTURE IN NORTHEASTERN
GUERRERO. Most of the recorded sites in the region of the upper Rio Tepecoaculico have
architectural remains which tend to be primarily tocated on tow hills and uplands.
Construction was largely of unhewn stone, both dry-laid and with adobe mortar. Dressed
stone included squared blocks, cylindrical columns, and rather unique conical pieces.
Painted lime plaster is evident in some floors and walls. Relationships of units within and
between sites is discussed in terms of density and site plan as they vary through time.
Although the Mesoamerican structure-plaza arrangement is well represented, rectangular,
pyramidal substructures are infrequent and may have been quite late in the region.(43)

, Hanson, Glen T. (Arizona S) SHARED-TOOLS OR SHARED-AREA: AN ALTERNATIVE
APPROACH TO THE ANALYSIS OF SPATIAL ASSOCIATIONS. In a recent paper
Whalion (American Antiquity 39:14-35) has presented a method for the analysis of spatial
association between artifact types which is based on the percentage of area shared by
intersecting tool clusters. This method yields comparative values which are evaluated against
all other pairs of tool types and from which spatial associations are discerned. This paper
offers an alternative approach which statistically compares the number of tools which occur
within intersecting too! clusters and those which occur outside of the intersection. This
method measures association by incorporating Chi Square, Pearson's Contingency
Coefficient, and Jacard’s Coefficient of Similarity in the analysis of a resulting contingency
table. An advantage of this method is that it measures the association between objects rather
than the space associated with the objects. Both methods are utilized in the analysis of tool
distributions at the Brand site, a Dalton campsite in northeast Arkansas. The results of this
study suggest that the shared-tool method provides a more sensitive estimation of spatial
association which may be applied in testing hypotheses concerned with spatial
variability.(41)

Hare, Edgar P. (Carnegie Inst) AMINO ACID DATING OF BONES, SHELLS, AND TEETH.
The proteins in calcified materials are relatively easily hydrolyzed to smaller peptides in free
amino acids. Even young specimens (approximately 100 years old) show significantly
increased proportions of free arnino acids when compared to fresh materials. An analysis of
the amino acid composition and the extent of the racemization of the amino acids as well as
a measurement of the extent of hydrolysis of the protein in fossil bones, shells, and teeth
should make it possible to deduce the age, temperature history, and leaching history of most

paper is a preliminary report on survey and site excavations carried out in exposures of the
Upper Member of the Koobi Fora Formation and in the Ileret Member (1.5 million years),
East Lake Rudolf. The analysis and classification of lithic remains from a complex of 14
archaeological sites reveal distinctive features that do not readily conform to other known
assemblages from archaeological sites in the Lower Pleistocene (Oldowan, Developed
Oldowan, Early Acheulian). A series of heavy duty (core) scraper and light duty scraper
specimens form a distinctive set within the tool category. Early Acheulian-like handaxes and
cleavers have been recovered in small numbers on the surface during the course of the
survey, but these forms are almost totally absent from the excavated sites. The strategy in
the excavation program of the Karari sites has been to sample traces of hominid activities in
known variable sedimentary localities. Geological and microstratigraphical studies
demonstrate the archaeological sites were located in or near channels and in river floodplain
contexts. One is able to discuss the evidence of the known distribution of sites and surface
scatters of stone and bone specimens in relationship to the paleogeography in an attempt to
discern patterns in hominid behavior.(36) a

ROO, MEXICO: SOME NEW LINES OF EVIDENCE AND IMPLICATIONS FOR MAYA
PREHISTORY. Studies recently published by Siemens and Puleston on work with “ridged
fields’’ in Belize and by Turner on terraces and “raised fields’’ in southeastern Campeche
and adjacent portions of Quintana Roo have shown the growing awareness of evidence for
agricultural intensification realized by the ancient Maya. A site survey conducted through
the Royal Ontario Museum over the past three years in southern Quintana Roo has yielded
additional evidence relevant to these studies. The large number of sites located by the survey
are distributed in a pattern which shows close association with the littorals of modern-day
“‘bajos," areas of poorly-drained ground which annually become seasonal swamps. Aerial
photographs of these bajos clearly show a gridded pattern of differential vegetation which
surely reflects the locations of raised fields in the bajos. The area covered by these patterns

NEW DATA FROM THE LEHNER CLOVIS SITE. In light of the data gained from the
Murray Springs Clovis site excavations of 1966-70, we returned to the Lehner Clovis site in
1974 to test for activity areas adjacent to the kill area excavated in 1954-55 by Haury and
others. Buried butchering and roasting areas were found along the south bank of ancient i
Mammoth Kill Creek and contained scattered flake tools, edge sharpening and retouch
flakes, and split bones of camel (Camelops sp.) as well as bison (Antiquus sp.). Bones of
mammoths Nos. 10 and 11 occurred in the channel sands of the ancient creek, and bones of
No. 12 occurred around a shallow roasting pit where charred and calcined bone fragments of
bison, bear (Ursus Americus), and a small artiodacty! were concentrated. In addition, bones
of a muskrat (Ondatra Zibethica), rabbit (Leporida), and garter snake (Thamnophis
cyrtopsis) were found on the Clovis occupation floor. A new pre-Clovis age alluvial unit was
recognized and mapped. Otherwise, the stratigraphic knowledge is the same as reported
previously with the important exception that significant but scanty evidence was found
within the “black mat’’ (Unit k of Antevs and F, of Haynes) of a post-Clovis Cochise-like
occupation. Replicate radiocarbon dating suggest a slightly younger age for the Clovis
occupation than heretofore determined.(33, 34)
Hecker, Howard M. (Columbia) DOMESTICATION RECONSIDERED: ITS IMPLICA-

from Beidha, Jordan (7000-6500 8.C.). The results of my analysis were ambiguous, with
evidence both for and against domestication depending on the various criteria and
definitions used. In the course of trying to deal with such ambiguity, it became increasingly
clear that the problem lay not with the data itself, but rather with the conceptualization of
the problem. Hence a reformulation was necessary which would call attention to the
cultural and the processual aspects of this human-animal relationship without being
restricted to the conceptually awkward term of “domestication."’ In this light we devised
the new term “cultural manipulation” which allows us the freedom to consider a whole
array of different types of human-animal relationships without being restricted by arbitrary,
preconceived categories.(24, 25)

Hewitt, James M., A REAPPRAISAL OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF VILLAGE FARMING
IN EARLY FORMATIVE MESOAMERICA,. Recent hypotheses for the development of
village farming in Mesoamerica and elsewhere have stressed the gradual transition from a
hunting and gathering seasonal or seasonal-round settiement-subsistence pattern to a
sedentary agricultural pattern. Work by MacNeish and his associates in the Tehuacan Valley
has demonstrated the inadequacy of the concept of “The Neolithic Revolution” (Childe
1925) by documenting the utilization of cultivars 2500 years prior to the first agricultural
villages in that area. The purpose of this paper is to show that, although cultivars were
incorporated into the subsistence pattern of non-sedentary hunters and gatherers in the
Tehuacan Valley prior to the beginning of the Ajalpan phase (1500 B.C.), it does not
necessarily follow from the data that a gradual evolution to sedentary agriculture occurred.
indeed, changes in artifact and plant frequencies before and after the Ajaipan phase show a
dramatic reversal that is related to the apparently sudden appearance of village farming.
Published data from the Tehuacan Valley and the lowlands of the Pacific and Gulf Coasts
are reviewed, and a new model for the origin of village agriculture is presented. The
interaction of highland and lowland settlement-subsistence systems, resulting in the fusion
of highland cultivars with the coastal sedentary settlement pattern, is postulated as the

| ultimate source of village farming in Mesoamerica.(43)

analytical approaches and applied to varying artifact classes are discussed from the
viewpoint of efficacy in recognition of spatial patterns. Co-variational patterns between
artifact classes and/or archaeological features are also discussed from several points of view.
A summary suggesting the utility of various analytical approaches insofar as they relate to
archaeological interpretation relative to this data base is presented.(35)
Hill, Frederick C. (Louisville) ECOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL INTERPRETATIONS OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES BASED ON ANALYSIS OF FRESHWATER MUSSELS.
Freshwater mussels from archaeological sites provide a wealth of information about the
paleoecology and inhabitants of the site. Discussed in this paper is the method of growth
ring analysis of freshwater mussels as well as certain aspects of trace element composition of
the subfossil shells. The use of these methods in determining season of site occupation and
various paleoecological aspects of the archaeological site determined from the mussels are
discussed.(11)
Hitchcock, Robert K., Bryan A. Marozas, and James |. Ebert (New Mexico) ANALOGY
AND THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF HUNTERS AND GATHERERS. One of the most
commonly cited avenues to understanding in the archaeology of band-level peoples is
ethnographic analogy. This exercise all too often takes the form of a conceptual
“translation” between a specific ethnographic occurrence and the appearance of a limited
and unique segment of the archaeological record. The few successful attempts at analogy in
the literature have involved an intermediate step in the translation process: the
consideration of theory. The importance of explicating behavioral and record-formation
processes in archaeological analogy is illustrated with reference to hunter-gatherer water
stress in the Kalahari region of Botswana.(27)

SITE IN NORTH FLORIDA. Three seasons of work at the Guest site in the Silver Springs
valley of north Florida are discussed, especially the finding of the remains of presently
extinct megafauna in direct association with man-made objects. Discussion includes the
discovery of fairly well articulated remains of two young mammoth, fragments of deer, large
cat, bison, and turtle. These remains were found in a single stratum varying about 15 cm
thick, buried beneath about 2.5 m of marl. Stratigraphic sequences are presented, as well as
illustrations of stone projectile point and other chipped stone artifacts. Fragments of bone,
referred to as bone “pins” are reported for the strata above the level in which the mammoth
remains were found. Evidence is presented to suggest the Guest site is a ‘‘kill site.""(33, 34)
Hole, Frank (Rice) PERSPECTIVES ON PASTORALISM IN PREHISTORY. Investigation
of modern tribal pastoralists in Luristan, Iran, reveals patterns of subsistence and seasonal
movements which shed light on both the history of nomadism and on our ability to find and
interpret its evidence archaeologically. The special nature of pastoralism in Luristan and in
similar areas of Southwest Asia raises doubts about many ideas concerning the genesis of
nomadism and its relationship to agriculture. The discovery and excavation of a nomadic
camp dating to about 6000 B.C. is exemplary of the importance of joint ethnographic and
archaeological investigations.(36)
House, John H., and Michael B. Schiffer (Arkansas Archeological Survey) THE CACHE
RIVER ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: SUBSTANTIVE RESULTS. While acquiring
information needed for federal agency long-term planning purposes, the Cache Project
operationalized several research designs involving substantive questions. The data yielded by
the application of the Cache Project sampling design complement previous reconnaissance
data by providing information on the number, density and patterns of distribution of
archaeological components. The survey artifact samples proved useful in studies of lithic
resource procurement and determination of cultural boundaries and distributions of human
population during various stages. Although the information on the populations of
archaeological phenomena in the Cache Basin provide only crude measures of systemic
variables of interest, the information is a considerable improvement over reconnaissance
data and suggests directions for the development of methods for using contract project
survey data in measuring systemic variables.(9)

House, Kurt (Southern Methodist) TOWARD PROGRESS IN FAUNAL ANALYSIS:
APPLICATIONS IN TEXAS. While faunal remains were among the first non-artifactual
material used in archaeology, the potential offered by adequate faunal analyses has not been
realized in attempts to reconstruct past behavior. Notwithstanding recently reorganized
theoretical goals oriented toward the collection of maximal site information, some reports
still appear in which conclusions are formed and hypotheses developed regarding
exploitative strategies without the participation of faunal evidence. The development of the
New World osteo-archaeological tradition has occurred in the milieu of biological theory,
paleontological techniques, and archaeological needs, but as yet produced a small
population of specialists unable to meet growing demands. Frequently the paleontologist or
zoologist, while qualified, is unwilling to turn from his own research and, in addition, lacks
interest in the interaction of man and contemporary animals in a dynamic environment. The
application of these realizations in Texas, as well as how improvement is possible, is
considered significant.(27)
Hughes, Jack T. (West Texas) THE REX RODGERS BISON KILL. Located in Mackenzie
Reservoir in the Texas Panhandle, and excavated in the fall of 1973, the Rex Rodgers bison
kill produced the remains of at least six animals resembling both Bison occidentalis and B.
antiquus. The group is marked by strong sexual! dimorphism. Of the five projectile points
recovered, two show resemblances to both Clovis and Plainview points, while three share
characteristics with San Patrice, Simonsen, and Hardaway points. The kill occurred in winter
during a cool moist climatic interval. C-14 dates are not yet available but other evidence
indicates an age of about 10,000 years.(33, 34)
Hurt, Wesley R. (Indiana U Museum) THE EDGE-TRIMMED TOOL TRADITION, Previous
classifications of South American preceramic lithic tool traditions that lack stone projectile
points do not encompass the full range of variation found in representative sites. Therefore,
a new stone tool tradition, the ‘‘Edge-trimmed Tool Tradition,” characteristic of northwest
South America, is defined. Diagnostic of this tradition are simple scrapers and spokeshaves
which have their working edges retouched by percussion flaking. The efficiency of these
tools is evident in their persistence from a time of about 12,500 years ago to well into the
ceramic periods (after 2000 B.P.). It is postulated that this lithic assemblage was used for
making wood artifacts such as projectile points and knives by peoples who lived in a
forested environment. It is doubtful that the lack of stone projectile points can be
attributed to a lack of knowledge on how to make this tool. Radiocarbon dates indicate the
Edge-trimmed Tool Tradition to have been contemporary with other cultural complexes in
surrounding areas which made stone projectile points. A possible source or origin of this
tradition is in the general area of the Cauca and Magdalena River Valleys of Colombia.(33,

ives, David J. (Missouri) HEAT-TREATMENT EXPERIMENTS: FACT OR FICTION?
Prehistoric heat-treatment studies usually utilize one or several replication experiments in an
effort to reproduce that particular combination of physical characteristics that the
researcher recognizes as indicative of heat-treated materials. However, these attempts to
reproduce prehistorically-derived changes in lithic materials fail to take into consideration
all those factors that might participate in such experiments. Because of the large number of
replicative experiments dictated by such factors, heat-treatment experiments must, of
necessity, be noted as indicators and not as determinants.(44)

Jeter, Marvin D. (see Reynolds, William E.)(27)
Jimenez-Moreno, Wigberto (Consejo de Historia, INAH, Mexico) THE WORLD
DIRECTIONS AND THEIR GODS IN MESOAMERICAN CODICES. Already in
Teotihuacan there existed an incipient arranging of the world directions, with gods assigned
to them. Later, in the post-Classic horizon, a new and more elaborated distribution of gods
and colors to the world directions is to be found in such codices as Borgia and Laud.
Finally, through the study of archaeological monuments, pre-Conquest and post-Conquest
codices, and Indian annals, as well as sixteenth century chronicles such as ‘Historia general
de las cosas del Nueva Espana” by Sahagun, and the interpretative efforts of Mexicans and
foreign Mexicanists such as Del Paso y Troncoso, Caso, Seler, Thompson, and Nicholson, it
was possible to rescue the world-view of the Mexica and to obtain such a wealth of
information that, thanks to it, we can try to reconstruct the outlook of earlier periods.
Many investigators have stumbled in the apparent contradictions when assigning different
gods and colors to the world directions. In order to clarify this, one has to realize that we
have to understand that in the course of time, the outlook changed, and certain gods like
Huitzilopochtli became important and replaced others. Also, the directions when
visualized—like in Codex Borgia—from Cholula, as it seems probable—are not the same as
when looked upon from the Valley of Mexico.(12, 13)

YUGOSLAVIA. During the summer of 1974, by means of a cooperative agreement between
the University of Kansas and the Zemaljski Muzej Bosne i Hercegovine, with financial
support from the National Science Foundation, excavations were conducted at the Upper
Paleolithic Gravettian site of Kadar in northern Bosnia, Yugoslavia. On the basis of tools
recovered and observations made on artifact distributions in the field, it is hypothesized that
the site represents a repeatediy-occupied hunting camp. Analyses of exact provenience data
on all artifacts, by means of pattern recognition techniques such as trend-surface mapping
and nearest neighbor analysis, are used to test the hypothesis and as well to search for
patterns of intra-site variability.(14)

ZOOARCHAEOLOGY. The development of zooarchaeology as 4 sub-discipline of
archaeology has proceeded at first slowly but recently quite quickly since the early 1950s.
Recognition of the importance of faunal remains to cultural interpretation is no longer
limited to the occasional “inventory of laundry list’’ appendix in a site report. Data from
developing methodology has and will aid archaeologists in interpretation of subsistence
systems, social organization and other cultural patterns as well as interpretations of the local
environment. Subsistence system covers 4 major portion of archaeological work and as such
the major contributions of zooarchaeology have been in this area of study. But
zobarchaeoloagical research is not limited to animals hunted or domesticated, and
environmental studies are increasing. Furthermore, zooarchaeological contributions are not
limited to archaeological studies, but have relevance in such disciplines as taxonomy and
zoogeography and the many sub-disciplines of zoology and geology. In reviewing the
methodology, the existence of principles or theories of zooarchaeology is discussed briefly
with statements of some of the current problems in the sub-discipltine.(11)

The major effort in the study of preceramic materials remains the elucidation of the nature
and spread of industries in the continent. Of particular interest are the burgeoning number
and variety of Paleo-Indian sites in the region. The ecological correlates of preceramic
occupations are also receiving much attention. Technological analyses, although not
common, have begun to be carried out in the area and can be expected to increase in
frequency in the coming years.(42)

, Judge, W. James (Chaco Ctr, Nati Park Service) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SAMPLING AND
CULTURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT. The satisfaction of many archaeological
research designs, as well as the satisfaction of Section 106 of the National Historic
Preservation Act, frequently carries the assumption of attaining a complete sample of the
area or site under investigation. To date, the issue of the relationship between archaeological
sampling and the satisfaction of both research designs and the legal requisites of the enabling
legislation has yet to be dealt with. Assuming one can demonstrate the efficacy of sampling
as an essential tool in the preservation of cultural resources, the question of what constitutes

an adequate sample becomes of crucial importance. This paper addresses itself to these
problems with the intent of clarifying the Issues, rather than proposing solutions, in the

hope that discussion can eventually lead to their resojution.(9)

a description for the general class of culturally relevant models of coding, and testing them

at a comprehensive rather than a particularistic level.(23)

PATTERN IN THE LOWER TULE CANYON, BRISCOE COUNTY, TEXAS. A recently
concluded survey and limited testing program was concerned with a portion of Tule Canyon

from its juncture with the Palo Duro Canyon toa point 17 miles upstream. A pattern of site
distribution was observed which has the following general characteristics: (1) Sites were

located either along the rim, on knolls at various elevations from rim to bottom, on terraces

along the creek, or on the floodplain at the mouth of the creek. (2) Sites in a similar
topographic location had a similar type or types of raw material, which differed significantly

from sites in other topographic locations. (3) In addition to raw material type, the amount

of material at the site and the nature of tools and debris differed between sites in each
topographic situation. (4) The sites in each similar location are considered contempora-

neous, but each group is chronologically distinct from the other three. In addition, every

site has only one component. The usual variables of time, space, raw material, and activity

are thus fairly well controlled. A lithic analysis can be expected to produce results which
pertain almost exclusively to technological variation. The results of that analysis are .
discussed in this paper.(3)

as supplement the aboriginal diet.(27)

Kittleman, Laurence R. (Oregon) GEOLOGY OF DIRTY SHAME ROCKSHELTER. Dirty

Shame Rockshelter is in the canyon of Antelope Creek, a headwaters tributary of the .
Owyhee River. The region is a deeply dissected canyoniand made of flat-tying, faulted
Miocene and Pliocene volcanic rocks, mainty rhyolites capped by basaltic rimrock. The
elevation of upland surfaces is about 5000 feet (1500 m). The rockshelter, a shallow
indentation beneath a spectacular overhanging cliff of rhyolite, probably was formed by

lateral cutting of Antelope Creek, now about 7 m below the site. Occupational deposits in

the rockshelter are about 2 m thick and grade downward into stream sand, with scant
artifacts, that was excavated to a depth of about 3.5 m below the present surface. The
fine-grained, dusty occupational deposits are discontinuously layered on a scale of
centimeters. They contain vegetable debris, seeds, charcoal, phytoliths (opaline parts of

grass), Knapping waste, angular pebbles, and mineral silt. There are scattered cobbles and
boulders that fell from the roof, but no single fall or sequence of falls is recognized. Most of

45 |
, il
the deposits came from plants and stones brought there by the inhabitants, except for
subordinate mineral silt, some of which may be windblown, and fallen stones. The
neighborhood of the site affords slabs of basalt or rhyolite good for milling stones and rough
tools, but there is almost no raw material good for kKnapped tools. Most artifacts of obsidian
and chalcedony found in the site must have been made from material gathered beyond the
environs of the rockshelter. Preliminary results from obsidian hydration analysis show that
thicknesses of the hydrated layers range from 2.6 to 6.8 micrometers. Measurements of
obsidian specimens found associated with cultural features are stratigraphically ordered, but
there is also evidence of stratigraphic mixing and re-use of tools.(17)

contributions. Major culture-historical syntheses have been developed from lithic tool kit

to assemblages and complexes from all temporal periods, and bipolar flake production is
becoming widely recognized. Lithic resource areas have been a focus of numerous studies,
ranging from variation in quarry and reduction techniques to an examination of regional
trade systems. Tool utilization analysis has been frequent, including detailed edge damage
studies and more morphologically based tool kit descriptions. The great assortment of
archaeological data from this vast region should support an even greater diversity of lithic
problems in the future.(4 2)

| PALESTINE. The questions | plan to discuss relate to the logistical problems encountered
by the zooarchaeologist participating with a large archaeological excavation (75 staff
members, 150 hired workmen) at a multi-period historical site in Palestine. At such sites
logistical problems present themselves as a result of (1) the large number of bone fragments
unearthed daily (sometimes more than 1000 per day); (2) the political and economic
restrictions on transporting the bone sample to the United States for further study; and
correspondingly (3) the limited amount of time available for the analysis of the bone
| fragments. Such limitations necessitate full exploitation of the opportunities for in-the-field
faunal analysis. The questions that must be dealt with under these circumstances are: (1)
| What are some tenable goals for the quality and quantity of the bone sample to be
analyzed? in view of these goals, (2) What are the requirements in terms of laboratory space
and equipment in the field? (3) What are some means whereby a comparative collection can
be acquired in the field? (4) To what extent can the zooarchaeologist train and employ
volunteer staff and workmen to assist with the processing of the bone fragments for analysis
by the zooarchaeolgist? (5) How does the zooarchaeologist communicate preliminary field
identifications of animal fragments to the excavation staff? (6) How can a computerized
data processing system be utilized In expediting the analysis of the bone fragments? These

traditionally accepted as having been Mesoamerican infiuenced, it was suspected the

Lavine-Lischka, Leslie (Arizona) AN APPROACH TO LITHIC ANALYSIS FOR DERIVING
CULTURAL INFERENCES. It is now widely accepted among archaeologists that culture is
patterned and the disturbances created therefrom appear in the archaeological record. Thus
the pattern of occurrence of material on an archaeological site has been culturally
determined. The archaeologist's challenge is to determine ways of detecting and interpreting
these patterns in order to make strong cultural inferences. Examination of total lithic
assemblages, both artifacts and debitage, can form one basis from which to partially
reconstruct the anthropology of former populations. The process and order of such a
reconstruction involves creation of a morphological typology for the entire assemblage,
mapping spatial distributions in order to determine activity areas and particular chipping
processes (as these are also culturally tagged), and finally examining and correlating the
results with the rest of the site information. Based on this theoretical and methodological
approach, the lithic assemblages from nine sites along Miami Wash near Globe, Arizona, have
been analyzed. The results include the ability to infer specialized site funcitons, diverse
activity areas, and several particular chipping processes, and where they took place on a
site.(35)
Lawrence, Barbara (Harvard) ANALYSIS OF UNIDENTIFIABLE BONE FROM CAYONU,
AN EARLY VILLAGE FARMING COMMUNITY. The value to the archaeologist of saving
unidentifiable scrap needs to be defined. Total recovery of all bone has increasingly become
a goal for excavators, but the time involved, both in screening and in processing the total
scrap recovered, seems not always commensurate with the information obtainable. Three
sorts of analysis have been tried on the Cayonu material: (1) relative abundance of different
sizes of fragments and their spatial arrangement in the site; (2) comparison, for a selected
unit in sequential levels of known area, of total abundance of bone with the amount and
kinds of seed recovered; (3) a fragment-by-fragment scrutiny of all scrap from a single
season's excavations to seek for and classify evidence of use or purposeful modification. All
of these relate to within-site problems, as does the lack of evidence for butchering practices
obtainable from the scrap. Because of the high degree of variation in condition and kinds of
scrap recovered from different sites, and because of the total rather low level of return for
time spent studying such material, it is probably not worth attempting to standardize scrap
analyses for purposes of intersite comparisons.(24, 25)

since large mound sites, which are the most usual targets of land leveling, provide the best
data for testing the whole structure and developmental processes of proto-urban
communities. Landform analysis, through mapping and air photo interpretation, is used here
to demonstrate that the magnitude of leveling can be specified, its differential effects ona

obscures.(14)
Linares, Olga F. (Smithsonian) DIFFERENT USES OF MARINE RESOURCES ON THE

is incorrect. Both species diversity and number of individuals (or population) are different,
and so are the ecological conditions (j.e., terrestrial and marine biomes) in which they occur.
in addition, the floral and mammalian faunal components on both sides of the Isthmus are
very different. These facts had a determining influence on prehistoric coastal adaptations in
Chiriqui and Bocas del Toro province in Western Panama.(2)

, Lipe, William D. (Museum of Northern Arizona) ARCHAEOLOGICAL CONSERVATION
AND THE WILDERNESS. Inclusion in wilderness areas can help protect archaeological sites
or groups of sites. Preservation of surrounding topography and biota may also be of
assistance to the archaeologist in reconstructing past environments. The wilderness aréa
concept can bring archaeologists together with other scientists and with conservationists in
joint efforts to preserve and manage resources of interest to each. Such combined efforts are
likely to have more success than the individual efforts of each type of specialist on behalf of
particular resources. Wilderness area status, of course, imposes rather severe restrictions on
persons entering the area, including archaeologists. Ordinarity, no motorized vehicles or
heavy power equipment can be brought in, for example. Recent research in the Grand Guich
Primitive Area, southeastern Utah, illustrates some of the problems and benefits in working
in a wilderness context. More pressing is the question of the place of archaeological research
in a long-range wilderness management framework. Archaeologists and public lands
managers must work together to develop guidelines.(26 )

approximately 500 km? mesa-top and canyon region in the pinyon-juniper vegetational
zone of southeastern Utah. Data collection was by surface survey and minimal test
excavations. The survey was implemented by a stratified random sampling design. Five out
of the 20 watershed units in the area were chosen as sampling clusters. Within these, a 7%
sample of 400 m? quadrats was completely surveyed for environmental and archaeological
data. Also within the five watershed units, the canyon environments were fully inventoried,
and a stratified random sample of the sites encountered was chosen for fuller study. The
results to date give confidence in the sampling design as providing reliable estimates of most
of the populations of targeted cultural and environmental variables. Substantive results
include the following: sites are abundant in the Basket Maker (BM) tI period, less so in BM
ii; the area is abandoned during Pueblo (P) | and early P I! times, but reoccupied from tate
P ii through mid to late P iit, then abandoned again. This sequence of occupation and
abandonment can be tentatively correlated with climatic and cultural-adaptive changes. A
substantial shift in settlement pattern occurs between BM I! and BM Ili sites; less so
| between the BM II! and Pueblo sites. Several, functionally different types of sites can be
distinguished for the several occupation periods, and their environmental relationships are
| being explored. For example, there appear to be interesting distributional differences
between habitation and special use sites.(37)

to argument. The various techniques of trace element analysis developed over the last
decade have allowed positive identification of chert types, and this has provided a means of
ene many problems of prehistoric social and spatial relations. In this paper,
distributions of cherts from a number of sources will be used to search for and examine the
nature of social boundaries existing in Michigan during the Late Woodland period. These
boundaries will be compared with ecological boundaries and with historically documented
social boundaries and trade patterns.(3)

Lyons, Ray (Colorado Archaeological Society) RELATIONSHIPS OF THE STATE
ARCHAEOLOGIST WITH AMATEUR ARCHAEOLOGISTS. A State Archaeologist needs a
broad base of support if his program is to be effective. In addition to legislative authority
and sufficient financing, he must have the active support of people who have knowledge and
interest in his programs. Amateur archaeologists are the largest and best informed group of
people available to provide this support. They have interest, enthusiasm, and a desire to
contribute, Their numbers include experts in many crafts and professions. Many are
organized into state and local societies. Legistative support, publicity, volunteers to work on
both emergency and long term projects, advisory committees to work on projects and long
term programs, legal and specialist services, are but a few of the situations where a State
Archaeologist may benefit from the participation of amateurs. A State Archaeologist may
benefit from acquainting himself with the amateur resources available to him and integrating
them into his program.(1)
Mack, Joanne M. (Oregon) A REPORT ON CERAMICS FROM THE KLAMATH RIVER.
This report describes and discusses briefly the significance of pottery and clay figurines
excavated from three sites (35 KL 16, 18 and 21) along the middie course of the Kiamath
River in Oregon, dated between A.D. 1300 and A.D. 1500 by C-14. it deals briefly with the

, question as to the source of these ceramics: independent invention, influence from Paiute
groups, trade with Paiute groups or influence from south-central and central Californian
groups.(6)
MacNeish, Richard S. (R. S. Peabody Foundation) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SEQUENCE IN
CAVES IN SOUTHWESTERN TAMAULIPAS, This is basically discussions of the various
types that characterize the following phases: Infiernillo, Ocampo, Flacco, Guerra, Mesa de
Guaje, La Florida, Pairnetto, San Lorenzo, and the San Antonio. Emphasis in defining these
phases is placed on the sequence of projectile point types, scraper types, and types of fabric.
This sequence with some gaps runs from about 7000 B.C. to A.D. 1750 and as we point out
some of the types have more connections with the materials from the Nuevo Leon than they
do with the Sierra de Tampaulipas.(16)
Madden, Louis A. (George Washington) DEFINING SUBGROUPS IN A CEMETERY
POPULATION: A MULTIVARIATE ANALYSIS OF BURIAL PATTERNS. Numerical
taxonomy and cluster analysis is applied to the problem of determining culturally relevant
subgroups within a cemetery population. Particular emphasis is placed on the difficulties
and limitations which affect the validity of the method in an archaeological context. The
error introduced through subjectively selecting and coding attributes is contrasted to the
major advantage of objectively evaluating and grouping burials. The method is applied toa
cemetery population associated with the Mobridge site (39WW1) in northern South Dakota.
Age is found to be the most significant burial attribute and three age groups, which receive
differential treatment at death, are defined.(14)

RESEARCH IN CHONTALES, NICARAGUA: ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PREHIS-

the Banco Central de Nicaragua has the goal of determining the cultural and ecological
relationships of Chontales, Nicaragua. Preliminary studies to that end are presented,
including comparisons of the Chontales ceramic and faunal remains with those of the
Atlantic and Pacific coast peoples. The implication of this work is that the Chontales
peoples are primarily local developments and had little dependence on other zones either
ecologically or culturally. This hypothesis is significantly different from previous views of
Central America as largely derivative from Meso- and South Amoerica.(39)
Marks, Anthony E. (Southern Methodist) UPPER PALEOLITHIC SITES AND CHRONOL-
OGY IN THE CENTRAL NEGEV, ISRAEL. Survey and excavations since 1969 have
brought to light 16 Upper Paleolithic sites in the Avdat/Aqev area of the Central Negev,
Israel. All of these are single or multiple occupations by single groups, with the exception of
site Boker which contains the nine stratified occupations, each representing a different
typological and technological “phase.” Combined, all these sites span the entire length of
the known Levantine Upper Paleolithic and, in fact, push the beginning date for a consistent
Upper Paleolithic blade technology to before 45,000 B.P. The seqence of assemblages, seen
from C-14 dates and stratigraphic position suggests a somewhat different pattern of
assemblage development than has been noted for northern Palestine.(36)

abundance of moliuscan remains on Late Archaic coastal sites (ca. 3000-1000 B.C.) has
resulted in a general stereotype of aboriginal inhabitants subsisting primarily on this
resource, Excavations in two shell rings on St. Simon’s Island, Glynn County, Georgia have
resulted in a systematic look at the nature of the coastal adaptation in the southeastern
United States at this time. Zooarchaeological analyses and preliminary fioral studies have
suggested that Late Archaic coastal sites represent the remains of procurement systems
focused on the salt marsh and adjacent maritime forest with no discernible reliance on
neighboring riverine environments. Based on these data, the implications of sedentary
occupation or use of the area in a pattern of transhumant subsistence is explored.(2)
Mascaro, Jill (i!!inois State) THE USE OF “XIPE’? AS A PERSONAL NAME IN MIXTEC
GENEALOGICAL MANUSCRIPTS. Few deity names were used as personal names in
Mixtec genealogical manuscripts. In his article “los Senoreés de Yanhuitian,’* Alfonso Caso
suggested that ‘‘Xipe’’ may have been the personal name of the rulers of ‘‘Twisted
Tree-Hill-Quetza!l River."’ On pages 33b to 35 of Codex Nuttall, seven members of this
dynasty wear a red and white headdress and/or a vertical line through the eye, features
associated with the god in the Borgia Group manuscripts. However, in Codex Nuttall the
face paint and headdress do not seem to function asa personal name. When members of this
dynasty are shown in Codices Bodley and Seiden or on other pages of Nuttall, they do not
have any attributes of the god. On Nuttall 33b to 35, the Xipe features seem to be worn
when the members of the dynasty are the progenitors of the next generation, suggesting that
the headdress and face paint may indicate who had the right to rule at ‘Twisted
Tree-Hill-Quetzal River.”” The name ‘Xipe" apparently cannot be added to the small list of
deity names that serve as personal names.(12, 13)

“A History of American Archaeology” (Willey and Sabloff 1974) is primarily concerned .
' with the changing emphases in interpretive stages of development. From another viewpoint
equally significant professional changes have been taking place in the past two decades in
archaeological objectives, site preservation, and administrative support. The development of
historical archaeology is partially shifting the emphasis from the traditional area of
aboriginal prehistory. Another area of change is the rapid growth of public archaeology with
State and Federal requirements, funding and support administered by State Archaeologists
and others. These emerging programs are providing an alternative emphasis for archaeolog
ical research.(1)
Meadow, Richard H. (Harvard) FAUNAL SAMPLES AND EXCAVATION IN THE
MIDDLE EAST. The realities of excavation on large sites of the Middle East require explicit
discussion of recovery and sampling procedures. Such considerations are especially
important when dealing with faunal materials. Bones depend for their qualitative validity on
the integrity of the excavation unit and for their quantitative validity on the kind of
recovery tused. Different recovery techniques are appropriate to particular archaeological
situations and produce information useful for different types of analysis. For instance,
excavation of the non-occupational fill of a room, because of its often uncertain
chronological unity, does not justify the use of finer recovery techniques, while floor
deposits or midden contexts do require dry screening or wet sieving. Furthermore, while all
measurable bones recovered from one time horizon may be a valid sample for osteometric
analysis, the relative frequencies of different species can most accurately be determined
from screened or wet sieved deposits. The faunal analyst must understand the limitations of
his or her sample, be confident of its integrity (or alerted to its jack thereof), and decide
how to allocate his or her time in analysis.(24, 25)

River in northwestern New Mexico was conducted in the summer of 1974. Recent studies
by The Southwestern Anthropological Research Group have sought to explain why
settlements are tocated where they are by focusing largely on the distribution of known
natural resources of assumed importance to prehistoric populations. Roads can be used as
direct indicators of connectivity between settlements and direct indicators of natural
resources made most accessible to prehistoric populations. The ability for prehistoric
populations to increase settlement interaction and resource accessibility directly through the
construction of roads suggests how the social and natural environment was both defined and
controlied.(20)

Murra, John V, (inst for Advanced Study) THE CONQUEST AND ANNEXATION OF
QOLLASUYU BY THE INKA STATE. According to dynastic oral tradition, once Cuzaco
Was safe, king Pachakuti began expanding the Inka reaim-of-the-four-quarters to the south,
by intervening in the disputes between the several Aymara kingdoms that emerged around
Lake Titicaca following the collapse of Tiwanaku. Eventually this area came to be
recognized as the richest and most densely populated quarter of Tawantinsuyu. But it has
taken us some time to recognize this fact; we need to understand how this wealth came to
be generated long before the Inka, in what looks to outsiders like the highest, the most
inhospitable part of the Andean world. These specific Andean riches (large herds,
preserved-food productivity, weaving energy, large populations) became part of Inka
resources when Qollasuyu was annexed. Current arachaeological, ethno-historic and
ethnographic research is used to suggest some priorities in tnka and Qollasuyu studies.(31)

| Nemaric, Juan Carlos (New Mexico) THE ROLE OF TAXONOMY IN ARCHAEOLOGY.
The reason for this short essay is to present 4 point of view which we feel would help
archaeologists and the continuance of serious scientific endeavors. it is, necessarily, based on
the critique of already conceived theory which we feel has no logical consistency nor is
empirically demonstrable. The conceived theory as exposed by such archaeologists as
Clarke, Chang, Rouse, Watson, LeBlanc, Redman and Dunnell, just to mention some of its
jatest proponents, specifies that taxonomies are abstracted as natural units, thus with
natural unitary values, from whatever Is being taxonomized to serve the purpose of
classificatory schemes. it is our belief that taxonomies are mere justification for |
classification which are devised by the archaeologists, from their own cognitive maps to
specify the conditions of the meanings given to their experience. Therefore, taxonomies are
conventional values given to conventional units. And however we interpret the archaeolog-
ical record is not helped by any supposed rule of inference abstracted from those
taxonomies as instruments for measurement.(44)
Netherly, Patricia (Cornell) THE MANAGEMENT OF LATE ANDEAN IRRIGATION
SYSTEMS. Andean irrigation networks on the North Coast and in the Central Highiands of
Peru have been studied and described in some detail. However, little has been known of the
way in which water was apportioned or the canals maintained in prehispanic times. Analysis
of early Spanish colonial irrigation regulations, early litigation over water rights, and
contemporary traditional practice show how much of the prehispanic Andean system was
retained under the Spanish and what modifications were introduced by the Europeans.
Rights to water as well as responsibility for canal maintenance are shown to be vested in
social groups under a kuraka OF tord rather than in individuals, beginning at the local level
| and ascending the socio-political hierarchy in the case of the larger and more complex
| systems. This basic pattern appears to have been used in canal systems constructed or
enlarged under the direction of the Chimu and Inca states.(32)

NINE ARCHITECTURAL PHASES. Using data on construction methods, axis orientation
and house floor area, three single post constructed house types and nine wall trench
constructed types have been isolated on Tract 158. Two superimposed circular enclosures, 4
chunky yard and a bastioned compound are present. Using stratigraphic data all these
structures are ordered into nine architectural periods. Analyses of these data indicate the
earliest three periods show lower class residential use of the tract followed by four phases of
‘“public-ceremonial” use followed by a return to residential use albeit higher class. The single
post constructed houses are in the first three phases and represent lower class residences.
Phases 4 thru 7 show the public structures—first with two superimposed circular enclosures
(meeting areas?) which are removed and replaced by 38 chunky yard which Itself is
dismantied and replaced with the bastioned compound (thought to be a trader's market).
The tract is then leveled and converted back to “orivate”’ residential use with the presence
of large wall trench houses in the last two phases. While these functional interpreations are
tentative, they reveal the diverse functional history of this tract at Cahokia.(45)

about the diet of siaves or middle-class white Southerners, including overseers. Excavation
of plantation sites reveals the remains of domestic and wild food animals used by al! the
inhabitants—planters, overseers, and slaves. |n addition to reconstructing their diet, there are
theoretical possibilities for hypotheses which can be generated to explain the differences
that appear in the zooarchaeological record at sites occupied by representatives of three
different social classes. Class differences are apparent in the diversity of wild animal species
present, the ratio of wild to domestic animals, the habitats utilized to collect foods, and the
attitudes concerning potential food sources.(2)

Disadvantages of the method described are (1) that we cannot as yet reliably distinguish
sheep and goat mandibles; and (2) little is yet known about variability in the relationship of
age to tooth-wear in different breeds and environmental conditions. Advantages of the
method are thought to be (1) that results are less affected by poor recovery or by
differential preservation than other methods; (2) that the method provides subdivision of
the later age-stages, all too often uninformatively grouped together as “adult" or “more
than 36 months’; and (3) that the method does not depend on subjective description or
’ judgment, and can therefore provide a dependable basis for comparison between different
sites and different workers.(24, 25)

1974 Pamunkey Project and analysis of flake debitage material from the Flint Run Paleo
complex have revealed trends toward favoring late stage biface thinning flakes for functional
utilization. It was experimentally determined that the more refined the biface, the more
functionally efficient were the flakes; and the more the knapper was aware of the attributes,
the more likely he was to obtain functionally efficient fiakes. it is hypothesized tnat
knowledge and contro! of the key factors above was requisite In the past for obtaining
optimum flakes for maximum functional utilization. Reconsideration of key platform
factors has led to the rejection of the significance of measuring angle beta. Angle theta, on
the other hand, is seen as the critical angle of significance.(3)

both the early and late Neolithic. An attempt is made to identify sources of these samples
based on previous analyses by Renfrew et al. Brief discussion is offered of some of the
chemical problems of analysis as well as the import of the results for regional trade patterns
in this period of prehistory.(44)
Ray, Arthur J., Jr. (York) THE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF THE EARLY FUR TRADE
OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN CANADA: SOME IMPLICATIONS FOR ARCHAEOLOG-
ICAL RESEARCH. The economic behavior and specialization of Indian groups involved in
the fur trade of the central and western interior of Canada before 1763 are examined, and a
spatial model of the fur trade developed. The implications which Indian economic behavior
and the spatial structure of the fur trade have for current archaeological research in
sub-Arctic and northern Plains areas are then considered. It is posited that the nature of the
early fur trade would lead archaeologists to underestimate the importance of the
protohistoric period as a time of rapid culture change, and indeed, make it difficult to
identify this period archaeologically.(10)

SOUTHWESTERN IRAN, WITH APPLICATIONS TO THE MONITORING OF PAST
ENVIRONMENTS. Populations of small mammals, particularly rodents, are sensitive to
changes in environments. Their distribution is usually closely related to one or more
variables of the niche. If the controlling variable(s) for a speties is (are) known then the
presence of that species in an archaeological context can be utilized to make statements
concerning the environment around the site at the time of deposition. Several problems and
assumptions are involved in utilizing presence of a species of rodent in monitoring past
environments: these are discussed. Preliminary work on determining the controlling
variable(s) for two rodent species from southwestern Iran is presented. it appears that the
distribution of Tatera indica and Meriones crassus is controlled by the presence of preferred
foods in sufficient quantities to support breeding colonies. T. indica utilizes primarily the
seeds, leaves, and rhizomes of grasses (Graminae) and M. crassus depends on seeds from
legumes that produce indehiscent pods. Using this information several comments based on
the presence of T. indica and/or M. crassus about the environment around the site of Ali
Kosh during the phases of occupation are made. These statements are supported by data
presented by other workers on the plant remains from Ali Kosh and the geomorphological
history of the area.(24, 25)

LOWER CHACO RIVER: OPERATIONALIZING RESEARCH HYPOTHESES FOR THE
REGIONAL SURVEY. An inventory survey of 68.5 mi? (177.3 Km?) along the east side of
the lower Chaco River in northwestern New Mexico yielded 716 cultural components,
including 3 Paleo-Indian, 99 Archaic, 5 Basketmaker, 191 Anasazi, and 413 Navajo.
| Recovery of archaeological and environmental data was structured within an explicitly
theoretical research design, based chiefly on the SARG probiem orientation which views
sites as loci of adaptive, maximizing behavior and seeks to explain why sites are located
where they are (Gumerman 1971; Plog and Hill 1971). Commonly held archaeological
assumptions about the nature of these sattlement-subsistence systems were used to deduce
which environmental parameters best expressed the location of relevant enersy gates on this
particular block of land. This, in turn, allowed generation of hypotheses of specific expected
relationships between certain site types, site densities, and certain environmental attributes.
Procedures used in operationalizing these tests, the results of these tests, and concomitant
settlement and environmental data are presented. Successful tests result in quantifiable,
explanatory devices, usually in the form of regression formulae, which allow accurate
prediction of site densities and locations along the lower Chaco and which should be
amenable to research in other areas. They will only prove useful if standardization and
comparison Is kept at the level of these overriding energetic relationships rather than at the
tevel of a set of arbitrary environmental measures.(37)

This report outlines and discusses the two objectives that must be considered in order to
meet both the needs of management and the desires of the scientific researcher.
Management's needs must be met effectively and completely, and this demands that the
researcher have a grasp of the practical needs and desires of the administrating agency.
Research goals must not be subverted or disregarded in an all out attempt to satisfy
management, but must be integrated with practical needs in a complementary fashion. The
survey research design discussed here is an attempt at blending purely scientific research
objectives with practical, pragmatic management needs.(9)

Rose, Martin R. (Arizona S) A SPATIAL APPROACH TO POINT PATTERN DISTRIBU-

occupation at Coe Lake Playa in the extreme southern portion of south-central New
Mexico. A refinement of the technique introduced by Whalion (1974) for the determination
. of spatial patterning among various functional tool types is based upon the significance of
correlations obtained between the types occurring within the boundaries of a “‘shared area”’
(Hanson 1974). In the present research the co-occurrence of tool types is examined within
areas defined by a grid network system. From this a similarity matrix is generated by the
computation of Pearsons product moment correlation coefficients for all of the variables,
and to examine the structure and order within the similarity matrix a multivariate statistical
technique is adopted. The results obtained are compared and contrasted with previous
research of this nature.(41)

Preclassic through the Postclassic periods have been established for the Yucatan north coast
(Dzibilchaltun) and the Central Maya Lowlands (Rio Bec). Comparisons of these sequences
to each other and to lithic assemblages from the Peten, Belize, and the Guatemala Highlands
indicate patterns of appearance and disappearance of lithic industries, diagnostic stone
implements, and distinctive trade lithic materials. In addition to well-known trade in
obsidian and basalt, implements made of quartzite, high quality chert, and even limestone
were variously employed in intra- and inter-regional trade networks. Two major competing
trade spheres are indicated: a Gulf Coast-North and Central Lowlands sphere tied to central
Mexico, and a Caribbean Coast-Peten Trans-Highiands sphere. A repetitive pattern of three
cycles of rise and fall are indicated: Proto-Classic, Terminal Classic, and Proto-historic.(43)

sub-bottom profilers, side scan sonar and divers should be able to locate the drowned sites.
Geological dating of various still stands places periods of low sea level at the same time as
the movements of early populations in both the New and Old Worlds. The excavation of a
specific underwater shell midden is discussed. Critical problems are raised, but final
decisions must await further research. Research methods suitable for studies of drowned

their occupational surfaces. The novelty of these results has been complemented by the
development of new sampling and excavation techniques, which contrast to those

A complete section of the sinkhole pond was exposed by excavation, with megafauna
located in marginal clays. No artifacts were recovered in situ, but the large nineteenth-
century collection was analyzed by a flintknapper and searched for micro-wear. Local flint
nodule shapes have caused most of the claimed typological peculiarities of the Caddington
sample.(8)

A.D. 1400. Changes in artifact design and frequency through time are correlated with shifts
in micro-habitat, subsistence strategies, and raw material sources. At least one major break

Schreiber, Kathy (SUNY Binghamton) JINCAMO@QU: ANOTHER “GREAT ENCLOSURE"
FROM MIDDLE HORIZON PERU. During June 1974, investigations were undertaken at
the site of Jincamoqo, near the village of Cabana Sur in southern Ayacucho. The site
consists of a large rectangular enclosure, a row of 17 circular structures (qolicas), and
various other smaller architectural remains. The site was mapped and a systematic surface
collection was undertaken; architectural style and ceramic associations indicate that the
enclosure is of Middie Horizon date. The work of William H. Isbell has suggested that rural
sites in Middie Horizon Peru were incorporated into a redistributional exchange system
upon which the Wari empire was based. Further, it has been suggested that the great
rectangular enclosures on these sites were used as collection and distribution points for
produce moving between the rural areas and the urban centers. Jincamoqgo clearly lends
credence to this hypothesis in several ways, including functional variation within the
enclosure, presence of storage facilities, geographical location, and artifact assemblages at
the site.(39)

activities on the valleys and plateaus of the Anti-Lebanon mountains. This paper reviews the
oreliminary results of those campaigns. A 1972 site survey in the central highlands of the
Anti-Lebanon produced ample evidence of their occupation during the early Holocene.
During the 1974 season, intensive excavations were begun in the stratified deposits of
Mughara et-Nachcharini, a medium-sized cave located on a high (2000 m) plateau of the
Anti-Lebanon near the Syrian border. Nachcharini's two meters of deposit (first tested in
1972) have yielded evidence of Upper Paleolithic occupations as well as a series of well
oreserved late Natufian/PPNA living floors containing abundant faunal, carbonized
dotanical, and lithic remains.(36) -

known as the Marismas Nacionales, on Mexico’s west coast. This area of the coastal plain of
northwestern Mexico was evidently more densely populated by man in protohistoric and

a marine diet, manifests itself in large accumulations of shell. This paper presents the results

and second, an attempt to isolate characteristics of the prehistoric natural and social
environments in the Marismas for the measure and definition of culture change in this

sites with the extremely uniform ceramic complex suggests that settlement was from the
eastern part of Hispaniola. it proceeded along the easternmost isiands, starting well after
1000 B.C., and had reached certain islands visited by Columbus in 1492 shortly before his

remains from a thirteenth century Anderson Phase Fort Ancient village in Montgomery
County, Ohio, reveals that the site was occupied perennially by 100-200 persons subsisting
on summer agricultural foods and meat from vertebrate species taken throughout the year.
Ninety-two percent of all meat was provided by four species (deer, efk, raccoon, and
turkey), and there is evidence that turkey was domesticated or controlled in a
semi-domesticated state. The pattern of animal exploitation at Incinerator is duplicated at
other Fort Ancient sites, suggesting that perennially occupied villages are a major site type

Sheets, Payson-D. (Colorado) SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA. Lithic analyses conducted
during the past few decades jn southern Mesoamerica may be categorized and evaluated by
considering their primary objectives: descriptive simplification, chronology, style, function,
or technology. The first three objectives predominate in eartier lithic analyses, while a shift
toward the latter two can be discerned within the last decade. The past decade has also seen
the proliferation of analyses of portions of the manufacturing continuum (quarrying,
workshops, the domestic mode of production) or topical analyses such as exchange systems.
These recent analyses have been facilitated by techniques such as obsidian hydration or
trace element analyses. The integrated combination of topical analyses with new techniques,
when founded on a firm theoretical base, should yield far more satisfactory conclusions
about what the Precolumbian Maya were doing, and why they did it, than past analyses have
been able to achieve.(42)
Shiner, Joel L. (Southern Methodist) EARLY MAN AND THE CONTINENTAL SHELF.
Cultural surveys of the Gulf of Mexico Oil Leases have produced a considerable amount of

Streamcut channels have been recorded at over 155 feet below present sea level. On the
other hand, extensive coral barrier reefs (now dead) indicate a relatively stable shore-lagoon-
reef system at approximately 190 feet below present sea level. Early man sites may be no
deeper than the interval between 155 and perhaps 180 or 185 feet. Dating of these
geological phenomena is not certain, but they are sharply defined, indicating no great
antiquity.(38)

The Chan Chen structure has a unique semi-circular arrangement of 45 small stones set into

floor and the intentional burial of the structure by several tons of large boulders suggests a
ceremonial function for the round structure.(39)

case study in the Canadian Arctic. Archaeologists have frequently felt immune from ethical
considerations (vis-a-vis native groups) in their work, and it is concluded that such an
isolation is unwarranted and undesirable. Native claims to archaeological resources are
shown, at least in some instances, to have an economic foundation as well as a moral one, It
is suggested that native peoples' interests with archaeological remains should be considered
from the conception of a project and that these interests are not necessarily incompatible
with field implementation.(28)
Singer, Clay A., and Jonathon E. Ericson (UCLA) QUARRY ANALYSIS. Recent studies on
prehistoric exchange systems have emphasized the consumption and distribution of traded
lithic materials. However, the role of lithic production within prehistoric exchange systems
is mot usually examined in detail. tndeed, production as well as consumption and
distribution are vital to our further understanding of prehistoric exchange processes. This
paper examines the production of obsidian products in an extensive quarry area located at
Bodie Hills, California, which served as an obsidian source beginning, at least, with the
Windmiller complex. During its operation the Bodie Hills quarry served as the main obsidian
source of the northernmost exchange system, one of two bifurcating systems originating
from Mono Lake. The details of our quarry analysis procedure involve debitage
quantification along random transects, computer density-contour mapping, debitage/
product ratios, and obsidian hydration measurements for chronological control. The
processes of lithic production are described within the spacetime framework. Our analytical
techniques have provided a means for estimating the production rates and material

| end-products for distribution within this prehistoric exchange system.(3)

YOUNG'S BAYOU DRAINAGE, NATCHITOCHES PARISH, LOUISIANA. The purpose of
this research is to determine the extent and form of prehistoric settlement in the Young's
Bayou drainage in Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana. A model of the contemporary ecology
was constructed through the survey of floral and faunal resources in local microenviron-
ments. This contemporary ecological model was correlated with evidences of prehistoric
technological exploitation from nine sites. Data from these sites were gathered through
surface survey at eight sites and through excavations at the Young's Bayou site. An intersite
analysis through the horizontal plotting of artifacts was done for the Young's Bayou site in
order to delineate the parameters of the site and to delineate activity areas. A tocal relative
chronology was constructed for the Young's Bayou area through the method of artifact
cross-dating. This culture history framework was utilized in the development of a settlement
pattern sequence for the area. A change in population density and distribution from the
Lithic stage through the Post-Formative stage was demonstrated. A semi-sedentary
wandering pattern was modeled for the Archaic.(45)

Netson raised the possibility of a prehistoric Trans-Beringian migration. His hypothesis was

61
, unique in that it was based upon specific artifactual evidence. New data from northern
British Columbia and comparative technotypological analysis of microblade core production |
provide additional support for Nelson's hypothesis. It is possible to recognize a Northeast
Asian-Northwest American Microblade Tradition and to define several subtraditions. The
distribution of NANAMT manifestations through space and time indicates the spread of the |
tradition from its presumed origin in southern Siberia/northern China to other parts of Asia
and across Beringia to the New World. The “spread” of the culture complex may have been
brought about through diffusion, migration, or both. tn evolutionary terms, it seems to be
the Advanced Palaeolithic-Mesolithic northeast Asian equivalent of southwest Asia’s
microlithic industries.(28)

Stamps, Richard B, (Oakland) WAS THERE SLASH AND BURN AGRICULTURE IN
CENTRAL TAIWAN AT 9000 B.C.? Matsuo Tsukada in 1966 suggested that the
destruction of primeval forests around 9000 B.C. at Jihyehtan in central Taiwan was
probably caused by human activities. K. C. Chang (1969) hypothesized that this destruction
of the forests may have been caused by Cordmarked pottery peoples shifting from a hunting
and gathering subsistence to a swidden type of root and fruit agriculture. Fieldwork by the
author in 1972-73 was undertaken (1) to gather more pollen to better understand the
suggested shift in vegetation, (2) to locate archaeological remains that might also reflect a
shift from hunting and gathering to swidden agriculture, and (3) Cordmarked pottery in
association with the change in vegetation. Confirming results were not forthcoming, the
9000 B.C. vegetational shift and related Cordmarked pottery associations are questioned.

Stanisiawski, Michael B. (California S-Hayward) ASK THE ONE WHO MADE IT:
HOPI-TEWA ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY. Regardless of the theoretical models utilized in
explanation, analogy and inference are still basic problem areas for all archaeologists.
Testable hypotheses should be based on what we, as anthropologists, know of the real
world; and this means archaeologists and ethnographers must work to build general models
iiustrating the relationships of human groups, tools, and the environment. My Hopi-Tewa
ethnoarchaeology project has been directed toward understanding the relationships of Hopi
and Hopi-Tewa individuals, corporate and non-corporate social groups, village, and tribal
units and ceramic technology systermns of the past and present. Specific conclusions
presented include: settlement patterns and social group relationships; how sites are formed
and artifacts recycled over generations; networks of information on pottery technology and
use of identification marks on pottery; typologies for the archaeologist and Native; history
of ceramic typology during the past 100 years, with emphasis on Nampeyo's influence on
Hopi Mesa pottery traditions.(10)
Stein, Pat H. (Proyecto Arqueologico-Huanuco Pampa) THE INCA’S HOSPITALITY:
FOOD PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION AT HUANUCO VIEJO. Andean patterns of
reciprocity and redistribution—socio-economic patterns which were extensively utilized by
the Inca empire—may also have guided the spatial plan of an administrative city. Two plazas
defined by kallanka-like structures dominate the main access leading from the central plaza
and ushnu to the palatial compounds at Huanuco Viejo. Material from recent excavations
strongly suggests that these structures functioned as centers of food processing and
distribution. This presentation examines some of the architectural and artifactual evidence
for kitchens and dining halls in this eastern sector of the imperial city.(31)
Stephenson, Robert L. (South Carolina) RELATIONSHIPS OF THE STATE ARCHAE-

evaluations and Moss-Bennett coordination? Should he be the arbiter in accreditation
matters and questions of professional standards? His role is changing and it should be
changing to a more systematic role out of the heterogeneous mass of roles that it presently
has.(1)
Stephenson, Robert L. (South Carolina) A HAUNTING SHADOW IN THE SOUTHEAST.
Early Man in the Southeast is but an ethereal shadow over the face of the land. We know he
is here but we cannot really see him or touch him. There are abundant index artifacts but
few clearly defined sites and fewer sites that have been exploited. Williams and Stoltman
reviewed the situation quite well a decade ago and only small increments of data have been
added since. A fresh approach may be indicated. Instead of pursuing the elusive fiuted point
or “Paleo-point,"" we should took to environmental data, and from that, prepare some
predictive models. Sea level fluctuations, climate, chemical and mineral content of river
valleys, depositional and erosional changes, and ecotone changes, among other things,
62
, should be considered in preparing the predictive models. The early work of people like
Antevs or Bryan in the southwest can provide guidelines. Some of the newer methods of
selectivity and predictability should then be applied to these quidelines. On this basis we
could then search out Early Man sites of significance and not to have to rely upon the
fortuitous “‘find'’ of an occasional index artifact. The “hunt and peck” recording of
fortuitous *'Paleo-points" in an area of heavy vegetation and depositional “smoothing” of
the landscape has been exploited to just about its maximum with little to show for the
effort. Let us now introduce a systematic plan of attack on the problem. | suggest that we
might begin along the coast with a thorough study of sea level changes.(33, 34)

oriented toward producing information on the distribution of artifact densities over a site.
The two most common methods of producing maps of artifact densities are hand drawing
and the SYMAP computer technique. Trend surface analysis, a multiple regression
technique, provides a third alternative. This technique has been applied to probability and
non-probability sample data collected in the urban zone of the Toltec capital of Tula,
Hidalgo, Mexico. Maps produced by this technique have been used to estimate the
population of that site during the four major phases of its occupation and to locate lithic
workshops within the urban zone.(44) |

PREHISTORIC SOCIAL SYSTEMS. Aspects of information theory are introduced and
discussed as an approach toward quantitatively measuring, on a ratio scale, the organization
of prehistoric social systems. The relationships between organization, and patterns of
interaction among the components of a system, are utilized to demonstrate the existence of
methods for quantifying both the amount and the degree of organization in structurally
63

theoretic measures to an enduring research problem in Midwestern prehistory: the nature of
social change from the Middle to Late Woodland periods.(23)

Quantitative analysis of midden components indicated which ecosystems within a given

used throughout the Aegean area from Mesolithic to Bronze Age times justifies an intensive
study of the production processes at the quarry as they relate to raw material constraints,
consumer demand at sites both near and distant, and to possible entrepreneurial activities.
Three types of obsidian outcrop, which occur at 22 localities, were used differentially.
Several workshop activities, often spatially distinct, are also described.(44)

Turnbull, Priscilla (Field Museum of Natural History) FIELD TECHNIQUES FOR
SALVAGING BONE ON PREHISTORIC SITES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. Bone at many
Middle East sites is poorly preserved for study. Field collecting techniques must be adapted
to deal with fragile bone that may have been subjected to periodic flooding, standing water,
fire, and wind, Usually the processes of fossilation by mineral replacement of organic
molecules have not advanced sufficiently to harden bone during the few thousand years
available. The problem is further complicated because many Middle East sites are in humid
areas, even though rainfall may be sparse, and many materials, such as shellac, will not dry.
Experience has shown that initial treatment of bone is most important. If fragile
fragmentary teeth and bone are handled roughly, tossed casually into collecting bags
without wrapping, the result will be useless heaps of powdered bone and broken tooth
tophs. A fraction of the breaks may be repaired, but much will be lost beyond a notation
. “large bovid"’ of “small artiodacty!'’ on faunal lists. Qualitative results are, even today, of
prime importance to understanding early environments; to identify as much bone as possible
it is necessary to collect with skill and care.(24, 25)
Verpmann, Hans-Peter (institut fur Urgeschichte der Universitat) THE USE OF OLD
COLLECTIONS IN MODERN FAUNAL ANALYSIS. The special situation of zooarchae-
ology in the Middle East forces us to deal exhaustively with all avaliable faunistic remains
from that region. The use that can be made of bone finds excavated without particular care
for the purposes of faunal analysis depends on the intention and intensity of selection by
the excavators. Various types of selection can be realized: (L) selection of well preserved
bones; (2) selection of teeth; (3) selection of worked bones. Independent of degree and
intention of selection old collections can be used for Ppaleozoological purposes. The
importance of this point must be stressed because there exists almost no paleozoological
base for faunal analysis in the Middle East. In this context the question of dating old
collections arises. The zoological data of old collections Is favorable to be stored in Data
Banks. For quantitative analysis, old collections are only Useful under special circum-
stances.(24, 25)

This paper deals with the methods utilized in the survey. Special emphasis is placed on the
mounds which appear to be burial tumuli. The majority are circular, domed mounds, which

Previous archaeological research on Atka was confined largely to the work of Jochelson in
1909 and Hrdlicka in the late 1930s, both of whom excavated and saw only a very small
number of sites on the island. Based on the work of those individuals as well as on the
linguistic work by Bergsland and the coastal survey of portions of the island by McCartney,
the 1974 research attempted to gain insight into the number and nature of sites on the
northern and eastern portion of the isiand as well as on the western tip of Amiia Island. This
research is anticipatory of research planned for 1975 which will focus at the excavation of a
single site from the historic (Russian) period on Atka.(28)
Verner, Roy (National Forest Service) PROBLEMS IN RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.
Resource managers face numerous problems from the implications of the National Historic

funding needed to get the inventory data, and readily available professiona! assistance.
Programs and projects may be delayed, modified, or abandoned. The manager is faced with
a new discipline whose members are basically research oriented and unfamiliar with Forest
Service land management techniques and objectives. Archaeology itself is a new resource
which the land manager must consider in his programs.(19)

by the enactment of the Archeological Conservation Bill will provide more employment
opportunities for archaeologists. The nature of current contract archaeology is such,
however, that curriculum in most departments of anthropology is not sufficient for training
in the specialized field of cultural resource management. This problem cannot be solved by
resorting to “salvage archaeology” but must be considered through a curriculum that
emphasizes conservation needs, administrative requirements, and high quality research and
report writing. The development of such a program at the University of Arizona is
discussed.(9)

AND THEIR USE IN DATING ARCHAEOLOGICAL BONE. In 1968 Hare and Abelson
published data which showed that the amino acids derived from fossil shell protein had
isomerized through time, In addition, they showed that the isomerization reaction rates
were temperature dependent and could be used to date these shells. Bada et al. (73, 74) have
recently extended this technique to include the dating of fossil hominid bone protein. These
authors assume that amino acid isomerization rates are primarily temperature dependent
and assign a minor role to the effect of other environmental variables such as the amount
and pH of ground water. Bada et al. control for these minor effects by ‘‘calibrating’’ their
sample with C-14 dates on coeval materials. Our experiments show that diffusion
phenomena are important in regulating the amount and type of amino acids remaining in
ancient bone, that species and size differences are important in this respect, and that the pH
of the surrounding water affects the isomerization rate of amino acids. Our data suggest that
dates derived from rates which do not account for these variables may be very
misieading.(44)

Wallace, Ronald L. (Florida) AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL, ETHNOHISTORIC, AND BIO-

Archaeological, ethnohistoric, and biochemical lines of evidence are brought to bear upon
the problem of reconstructing the social organization and technological adaptation of the
Guale aborigines of the Georgia coastal strand. The archaeological data were obtained during
field sessions in the Summer of 1973 and 1974. Results of these excavations are compared
with relevant Jesuit and Franciscan ethnohistorical materials to provide understanding of
coastal social organization and subsistence. The biochemical investigations involved the
66
, comparison of human skeletal remains with associated zooarchaeological materials to
determine absolute and relative amounts of stable strontium—38 present in human bone,
Uitimately, this provided information regarding aboriginal animal and plant utilization,
which was then related to the subsistence data elicited from the ethnohistorical and
zooarchaeological analyses, and soil samples subjected to standard chemical flotation
techniques. The investigations revealed an aboriginal subsistence base of fishing, oystering,
hunting of small mammals, and gathering of plant foods. Due to Spanish acculturation, this
changed to an increasing reliance upon horticultural activities. These results need to be
supplemented by further extensive excavation along the mainiand areas of the Georgia
coastal strand.(44)

of the major sites have been excavated according to a highly stratified sampling procedure as
well as rooms in a series of agglomerated small sites. A hierarchical attribute classification

data, and architectural information it is possible to define the relative degree of interaction
among and between room blocks for the sites examined.(37)
Watts, Gordon P., Jr. (North Carolina Dept of Cultural Resources) OCEANOGRAPHIC
TOOLS AND TECHNIQUES IN UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGY: THE SEARCH FOR
THE MONITOR. On August 27, 1973, a scientific party composed of archaeologists,
oceanographers, and electronic engineers located the remains of the ironclad warship U.S.S.
Monitor off the coast of North Carolina. The Monitor, perhaps the most revolutionary vessel
of the nineteenth century, sank 15 miles south-southeast of Cape Hatteras on December 31,
1862. The location and subsequent identification of the vessel was the result of an
interdisciplinary research proposal designed to both study a ridge and swale feature on the
continental shelf, and evaluate the application of oceanographic tools and techniques to
deep water shipwreck site location and identification. The investigation utilized a
combination of precision positioning systems, proton precession magnetometer, and
directional, vertical, and side-scan sonar to locate sites, and relied upon deep water
photography and closed circuit television to identify them. In April 1974, a second cruise to
the Monitor site was made for the Purpose of obtaining a complete photographic and
television tape record of the site, and collecting specific samples from the wreck for
laboratory analysis. The project utilized the ultrasophisticated research vessel Alcoa
Seaprobe. The oceanographic techniques adapted to the Monitor project have a broader
application that can be generalized to assist in the development of future deep water site
surveys. The work further implies that a great deal of that data essential to the surveying,
analysis, and evaluation of deep water sites, presently beyond the technological limits of
archaeological investigation can be effectively collected remotely.(38)

Weide, David L. (Nevada), and Margaret L. Weide (SUNY Binghamton) TIME, SPACE, ANDO
INTENSITY IN GREAT BASIN PALEOECOLOGICAL MODELS. Holocene climatic
change in the Great Basin involves five time/space/intensity parameters of significance to
paleoecological models. First, from an archaeological standpoint, data on climate change
and a concomitant increase or decrease in carrying capacity have come from a few small,
highly specialized microenvironments that may only partially represent the entire region.
Second, no attempt has been made to establish the limits that define an area as inhabitable,
especially to a population already culturally adapted to intermittently dependable food and
water resources. Third, postglacial climate change in the Great Basin probably took place in
a geographically irregular manner resulting in a_ series of stratigraphic, pollen, and
geomorphic units that are similar and perhaps correlative, but not necessarily synchronous.
Fourth, hydrologic models of pluvial lakes indicate that departures from present values of
temperature and precipitation were relatively small during periods of change and were
influenced by local conditions of microctimate, topography, and geologically controlled
hydrology. Finally, while periods of Geparture from the climate of today were of
considerable duration, the rate of transition between the extremes was relatively rapid. This
may have produced conditions of ecological stress that are not reflected in the
archaeological, sedimentary, or pollen record.(5)
Weide, Margaret L. (SUNY Binghamton) RESEARCH DESIGN IN NORTHEASTERN
PREHISTORY. Computer banking of site locations relative to topographic and environ-
mental variables does not in itself constitute a research design. Despite the success of ;
large-scale settlement pattern studies undertaken in the American west and elsewhere, the
charms of such an approach may not transplant to the eastern Woodlands, and the
profession may be fooling Itself if it justifies the next several years of contract archaeology
as data gathering for settlement pattern archaeology. Explicit research questions focusing on
population dynamics, technological development and subsistence changes will be discussed
as sources of testable hypotheses appropriate to effective research design.(14)

Wendorf, Fred (Southern Methodist) AN ATERIAN KILL SITE IN THE EGYPTIAN
SAHARA. In the spring of 1974, excavations were conducted at an Aterian kill site located
350 km west of Abu Simbel in the center of the Egyptian Sahara. The rich faunal remains
included white rhino (Ceratotherium simum), extinct, camel (Cametus thomasi), gazelle
(Gazella rufifrons and G. lamd), ass (Equus asinus), and a large bovid (probably the extinct
Homoceras antiquus), associated with several thousand tools and artifacts. The site had been
repeatedly utilized by Aterian hunters over a considerable period of time. Artifacts and
fauna occurred throughout some 2 m of lacustrine sediments. A radiocarbon date of 43,300
B.P.43000 years (SMU-177) was obtained on shell from the middle of the deposit; however,
the true age is believed to be beyond the limits of the technique.(36)
Wetterstrom, Wilma E. (MIT) A NUTRITIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE TEHUACAN FOOD
REAMINS. Richard MacNeish's Tehuacan Valley Project recovered a remarkable collection
of food remains which provide a tong, continuous record of, the dietary changes
accompanying the development of agriculture. This report presents a re-analysis of the floral
and faunal data from a nutritional perspective. It assesses the limitations and potential of
such data for inferring dietary composition and nutritional status and presents a
methodology for analyzing the Tehuacan material. Results are described which suggest
different “conclusions about the Tehuacan diet and subsistence than have previously been
proposed.(43)
Weymouth, John (Nebraska) THREE SEASONS OF MAGNETIC SURVEYING ON
CENTRAL PLAINS SITES. Since the summer of 1972 we have been testing the value of
magnetic surveys of typical Central Plains sites. Since these sites do not have such
maanetically detectable structures as brick walls, Kiln, or statuary, it is not obvious a priori
whether magnetic surveying will be of value. We have found that it is possible to locate fire
hearths and, under favorable conditions, cache pits. A brief discussion of the theory will be
given along with a summary description of our data processing procedure. We will discuss
our results, in particular those of 1974 on sites in northwestern lowa and on the Missouri
River in South Dakota.(14)
Whalen, Norman M. (Southwest Texas) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN SOUTH-
EASTERN IMPERIAL COUNTY, CALIFORNIA. A preliminary report is given of an
archaeological survey In southeastern California where 188 sites were discovered on terraces
between the Cargo Muchacho and Chocolate mountains and the floodplains of the Colorado
River. The sites consisted variously of cleared areas having different geometric shapes
including “sleeping circles," 12 unique “ceremonial” configurations, lithic remains, some
heavily patinated with desert varnish, ancient trails, and a small quantity of ceramics. The
character and distribution of the sites with an interpretation supported by factor analysis
correlating architectural and artifactual components and terrace elevations is presented.(6)
Whatley, Bonnie L. (Northwestern) THE STUDY OF ANIMAL BONES WITHIN THEIR
CULTURAL CONTEXT. Faunal remains when studied in conjunction with other
archaeological data can better lead to the reconstruction of behavior patterns at various
68
, levels of abstraction. Interpretation of faunal remains is facilitated through careful recording
of debris, artifactual and structural associations for the bones at an archaeological! site and in
turn, later characterization of the condition of the faunal remains aids in the interpretation
of the nature of these debris association. For instance, on a very basic level, characteriza-
tions of diet can only be attempted when faunal remains are studied in conjunction with
botanical remains and when this information is combined with data derived from the study
of human skeletal populations, nutritional reconstructions become more realistic. Finally,
faunal exploitation should be interpreted as a part of a larger subsistence strategy. This can
be accomplished by including relevant data from botanical and settlement pattern analyses
in the study.(11)
Wheat, Joe Ben (University of Colorado Museum) ARTIFACT LIFE HISTORY RE-
SEARCH—OR TYPOLOGY REVISITED. Current research at the University of Colorado
Museum on projectile points from the Jurgens, Olsen-Chubbuck, Claypool, and other Piano
period sites indicates that life history studies of individual artifacts have a strong bearing on
typology, on utilization patterns, and on reconstruction of weaponry. The study
demonstrates that many Plano projectile points have been utilized as knives as indicated by
wear patterns, that hafting techniques are commensurate with this function, and that many
complete projectile points are secondarily reworked from origina! points, thus calling fora
reassessment of current typology.(33, 34)
Williams, Stephen (see Griffin, James B.)(7)
Williams-Dean, Gienna (Texas A&M) TECHNOLOGICAL STUDY OF ARCHAIC SAN-
DALS FROM THE LOWER PECOS REGION OF TEXAS. A study was undertaken to
describe, analyze, and classify the technological methods Involved in the manufacture of
fiber sandals recovered from the tower Pecos region of Texas. An examination of these
unique representatives of Archaic clothing yielded an idea of the aesthetic and functional
norms of the prehistoric inhabitants of the lower Pecos region as regarded footwear, and
their variations over time and/or space. Subsequent comparison with published descriptions
of sandals from Mexico and the American Southwest helped establish the range of these
norms or styles and gave further insight into the cultural behavior of these Archaic Texans.
The sandal collection which was partially analyzed is composed of specimens mainly from
excavations or collections in Val Verde County, Texas.(22)
Windmiller, Ric (see Eddy, Frank W.)(40)
Wiseman, Frederick Matthew (Arizona) and Edward S. Deevey (Florida State Museum) THE
EARLIEST MAYA. Recent palynological work suggests the entry of man into the Peten
rainforest before or during the fourth millennium B.C. Modern pollen-ecological anatogues
applied to the analysis of fossil pollen recovered from Lake Eckixil, Peten, have isolated
man-associated lowland pollen types and their fluctuations through time. Lowland
colonization (4000-3500 B.C.) was followed by increased clearing and burning, but the
absence of Zea pollen suggests this is ‘‘maizeless"’ cultivation. Zea is first evident in the
pollen record around 2000 8.C., followed by a sharp increase in cultigen, weed and burning
indicators after 1500 B.C. The intensity of lowland agriculture thereafter remained
relatively constant until a rapid decline in agriculture indicators heralded the A.D. 800
Collapse.(27)
Witter, Dan (Arizona State Museum) THEORETICAL DIRECTIONS FOR ARCHAEO-
ZOOLOGY. The paper is directed toward the theoretical use of faunal remains, arguing for a
distinction between faunal analysis and archaeozoology. Reconstruction analyses such as the
reconstruction of environment or reconstruction of diet or human activities would be
relatively non-theoretical but, of course, vital pattern-recognition tasks for the_ faunal
analyst. Archaeozoology, on the other hand, should be a body of dynamic processual
theory. Unfortunately, we do not really have such a body of theory and are faced with
having to develop it ourselves, now. Because of this problem, some possible productive
directions are discussed, drawing from work with the Nunamuit caribou material to
itiustrate points. This paper focuses on operationalization of measures of organization of
subsistence strategies and logistical structures and the sorts of data which would be
required.(11)
Woodall, J. Ned (Wake Forest) A POSSIBLE CEREMONIAL PRECINCT IN VALENCIA
COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. Near-complete excavation of a50-room site in west-central New
Mexico suggests its use as a restricted activity site, possibly centering around ceremonial
activities. The site is located on top of a tiny butte, difficult of access and surrounded by
sites on the valley floor. Partial excavation of the valley sites revealed no kivas or C-type
rooms, whereas these are frequent on top of the butte; pictographs are present on top of the
butte but not on its base; and certain artifact types are restricted to the butte top.(20)
Worf, William A. (United States Forest Service) CULTURAL VALUES IN THE WILDER-
NESS: THE WILDERNESS PERSPECTIVE. We examine this question from the standpoint
of the basic reason for a Wilderness Systern which is: “‘to assure that an increasing
population, accompanied by expanding settlement and growing mechanization, does not
occupy and modify all areas within the United States....’' To achieve this purpose
Congress set a policy to: “secure for the American people...an enduring resource of
69
, wilderness...." The Act defines Wilderness and says it may also have “ecological,
geological, or other features of scientific, educational, scenic, or historical value.... "itis
clear, therefore, that the framers of the Wilderness Act accepted the fact that cultural values
are a consistent part of Wilderness. (The wilderness resource itself is a part of our cultural
heritage.) Cultural values must be carefully evaluated as part of the study process leading to
a decision as to the suitability or non-sultability of any land for inclusion In the National
Wilderness Preservation System. If the interpretation, protection, or use of these resources
will require actions contrary to the protection of wilderness values, they should not be
placed in the Wilderness System. Once included in the system, wilderness resource
protection takes precedence over other values.(26)
Wright, Henry (Michigan) INFORMATION, CONTROL, AND POLITICAL HIERARCHY.
Information-related concepts are useful for constructing testable propositions about
political evolution. However, to test propositions involving concepts such as information
processing, the hierarchy of codes, or the hierarchy of control will require that
archaeologists collect data in new ways. Examples from centers of early state development
will be discussed.(23)
Wylie, Henry G., QUANTIFICATION OF PROJECTILE POINT TYPOLOGIES: THE
MEAN-MODEL METHOD. In the past, loose, subjective and over-generalized projectile
point type descriptions have prevented all but the most superficial artifact comparisons.
Proposed is an objective-statistical method which can conveniently and accurately .
characterize point types for purposes of detailed description and comparison, It may
provide answers to the typical typological) queries of ‘Are these the same as those or are
they different?” and if so ‘How much?" and “In what ways?” The techniques, capabilities,
limitations, and potential of this method are discussed, and a test example utilizing Elko
split-stem and Joe’s Valley projectile points from Utah is itlustrated.(14)
Wymer, John J. (see Gladfelter, Bruce G.)(8)
Yesner, David R. (Connecticut-Storrs) MARITIME HUNTER-GATHERERS:
DEMOGRAPHIC AND PALEODEMOGRAPHIC MODELS. Maritime hunter-gatherers are a
specific subset of hunter-gatherers in general, characterized by a resource configuration
allowing a wide variety of settlement patterns. These settlement patterns include varying
degrees of sedentism, depending upon changes in the density or diversity of resources
available at different times of the year or over longer periods of time. Construction of
population models for maritime hunter-gatherers involves combination of demographic data
from ethnographic and ethnohistorical sources with data from faunal and human skeletal
materials. The Aleutian Islands are examined as a model area for this kind of study, and
differences are noted from other arctic coastal populations. This methodology can also be
extended to the analysis of non-coastal hunter-gatherer populations.(2)
Young, John N. (National Park Service) CULTURAL RESOURCE PRESERVATION:
FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITIES IN WILDERNESS AREAS, Cultural resources are archae-
ological, architectural, and historical objects, structures, sites, and districts. Beginning with
the passage of the Antiquities Act of 1906 and continuing to the present, a series of
legislative and executive cultural resource preservation documents has appeared. Each
subsequent item served to expand and make more inclusive the scope of federal interest,
concern, and responsibility. This developmental sequence culminated in 1972 with the
issuance an Order 11593, which served to bind all of the preceding documents
into a single comprehensive whole. Executive Order 11593 mandates many things, four of
which are: every Executive Branch agency, bureau and office must: (1) compile an
inventory upon which Is listed every cultural resource for which it is trustee; (2) nominate
all eligible properties under its effective control to the National Register of Historic Places;
(3) preserve and protect the cultural resources for which it is responsible; and (4) insure that
its plans, policies, procedures, and activities contribute to the preservation and protection of
non-federally-owned cultural resources. Implications of the above four points for cultural
properties in Wilderness are explored.(26)
Zeder, Melinda (Michigan) THE USE OF OSTEOLOGIC MICRO-STRUCTURE AND
CHEMICAL COMPOSITION IN THE DETERMINATION OF WILD AND DOMESTIC
CAPRINES. A major problem in zooarchaeological research in the Near East has been the
determination of caprine remains from archaeological sites as wild or domestic. There are to
date relatively few morphological characteristics which may be used in this aim (see Hole,
Flannery, and Neely 1969), The answer to this problem may not lie in the gross morphology
of the bone but rather in its micro-structure and chemical composition. Using techniques of
polarized microscopy and x-ray diffraction Drew, Perkins, and Daley (1971) demonstrated
differences in the alignment of the apatite crystals of bones of domestic and wild sheep and
goats. Although a provocative first step in the use of such techniques in zooarchaeological
study, the study had several drawbacks. First, the original study used only archaeological
material which could not be positively identified as domestic or wild, and which were
therefore unsuitable to test the effectiveness of these techniques. Secondly, they offered
little in the way of concrete explanations for the difference noted. Keeping these drawbacks
in mind, the approach of Drew, Perkins, and Daley is considered here. The micro-structure
and chemical composition of the bones of modern wild and domestic Iranian sheep are
examined, the domestic sheep representing three different herding strategies: lowland
70
;
, sedentary, lowland-highiand transhumant, and highland-highland transhumant. Such tech-
niques as polarized microscopy, scanning electron microscope, and atomic absorption
studies are used. The aim of the study is to determine differences in the inner structure and
composition of bone which may be used archaeologically not only to distinguish between
wild and domestic caprines but between caprines raised in different environments with
different adaptive strategies.(24, 25)
Zeder, Melinda A. (see McArdle, John)(24, 25)
Zeimens, George (Office of the Wyoming State Archaeologist) WYOMING'S PROBLEMS IN
THE ENERGY CRISIS. Since the advent of the “energy crisis’ there has been a mad
scramble by industry to begin to develop rich deposits of coal and uranium in Wyoming.
Most of these deposits are most efficiently extracted by the open-pit mining method
resulting in the surface disturbance of hundreds of thousands of acres. This, along with
increased oil exploration and energy-related projects such as access roads, reservoirs,
railroads, pipelines, and powerlines, have created some extremely difficult problems for the
State Archaeologist. in the face of this increased work load the Wyoming Archaeologist
continues to operate with a very small budget and no permanent staff. Other problems of
major concern are the lack of communication and cooperation between federal and state
agencies and industry. Most critical is the frightening fact that contract and Salvage
archaeology is a growing threat to the good, solid archaeological research that has gone on in
Wyoming for the past few years.(1 )

Zeitlin, Robert N., and Judith Francis Zeitlin (Yale) ENVIRONMENT AND CULTURAL
ADAPTATION ON THE SOUTHERN ISTHMUS OF TEHUANTEPEC: THE PRECLASSIC,
CLASSIC, AND POSTCLASSIC PERIODS. These papers describe the physical and
biological resources of the Pacific coast of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec as they exist today,
how they are used by indigenous peoples of the area, and how they are likely to have been
altered fram their prehistoric condition since the time of the Spanish Conquest. From this
background, using data collected during our excavations and surface survey of the Rio de los
Perros region, we attempt to describe the prehistoric use of these resources from about 1500
B.C. to A.D. 1500. Of particular interest is the diversity of the food procurement system in
this area, in contrast to that of some other coastal environments where marine and estuary
food resources are relied upon to a much greater degree. We will also examine the location
of population centers in the past with respect to resource utilization and the effect of
changing population densities on diet and food-getting activities.(2)
Z2urel, Richard L. (Georgia) SEASONALITY OF UNMANAGED FOOD RESOURCES IN
THE GREAT LAKES REGION: A LOOK AT THE CULTURAL AND ECOLOGICAL
NICHE OF MARGINAL AGRICULTURE. Food résources historically recorded for the
indians of the Great Lakes region are combined with ecological and botanical information
from southern Michigan to generate a model of seasonal availability of wild food resources
and their relationship with emergent agriculture. it is suggested that emergent agriculture
| could have begun out of an archaic adaptation of a seasonal round and that a shift in
settlement pattern or exploitation to alluvial bottomiands may not have been an essential
ecological adaptation.(27)

, ABSTRACTS OF ORGANIZED SYMPOSIA
(2) ADAPTATION TO COASTAL RESOURCES. The resources of marine environ-
ments have been used by man from early prehistoric times to the present day. While
the coast is recognized as a hospitable environment, the dynamics of the adaptation to
the coast and the sea have been only minimally investigated by archaeologists. Our
present understanding of adjustment to coastal resources is the result of integrated
archaeological and biological efforts. This symposium seeks to examine space and time
perspectives of man's use of flora and fauna in the coastal ecotone.
(3) RECENT EMPHASES IN LITHIC ANALYSIS. Recent emphases in lithic analysis
include diverse and highly technical methods and approaches, all of which could not
be summarized in one symposium. The participants do, however, represent a variety of
innovative approaches. Each paper describes a method for the analysis of lithic artifacts
or materials, and each focuses on the usefulness of that approach in either establishing
chronology, distinguishing peoples, describing processes of change, reconstructing pre-
historic manufacturing, utilization or exchange systems, or recognizing individual
knappers.
(4) CONFIRMATION IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Confidence in the validity or falseness of
propositions is one meaning of knowledge. Knowledge is gained through the testing of
propositions. This symposium explores methods and techniques of archaeological con-
firmation and the philosophical bases on which testing rests.
(5) MODELS AND GREAT BASIN PREHISTORY. This symposium reviews and
evaluates the interrelationships between archaeology and models and methods of dis-
ciplines contributory to archaeology in the Great Basin. The central question for
discussion is, What are the problems of ‘fit’ and congruence between archaeological
models and methods and linguistic, paleoecological, ethnographic, and physical anthro-
pological/demographic models and methods? Are specialists in the several fields talking
to or past each other?
(8) RECENT RESEARCH ON THE EUROPEAN PALEOLITHIC. Members of the
symposium, most of whom are archaeologists based at North American universities, will
report on recent field research undertaken by them and others. The research concerns
various aspects of the Paleolithic (Lower, Middle, and Upper) as determined from sites
primarily but not exclusively in western Europe. The communications will emphasize
the kind of research undertaken and the results obtained to date. Where relevant, the
relationship of the “foreign’’ research to that being undertaken by national archae-
ologists in the countries concerned will be considered.
(9) ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT.
The symposium examines a variety of approaches for gaining the maximum benefit
from contract research for both the scientific community and cultural resources
management. Emphasis Is placed upon training competent researchers, employing viable
research strategies, maximizing returns on the studied materials, and gives concrete
examples of studies that have considered both management requirements and scientific
research interests.
(10) IDEATIONAL DIMENSION IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Archaeology has tended to be
dominated by interpretations formed in a materialist framework. Those aspects of past
societies that are most closely and directly related to cognitive schemata have con-
sequently tended to be slighted. This symposium explores what may be termed the
ideational dimensions of human behavior in reference to archaeology, including
cognitive archaeology, structuralism, symbolic systems, and ethnographic models. The
ideational dimension, added to the more standard methodologies, brings archaeology closer
to the core of anthropological theory.->
(11) TECHNIQUES AND METHODOLOGY IN ZOOARCHAEOLOGY. The field of
zooarchaeology |s rapidly developing within the discipline of archaeology. As such, there isa
definite need for more of an agreement on the use of techniques and methodologies which
have been used in zooarchaeology along with recognition of the limitations of each. Studies
of both vertebrates and invertebrates within an archaeological context can contribute
significantly to the understanding of a prehistoric culture. The symposium will deal in
general with the types of research and possible interpretations in zooarchaeological work.
(12,13) FIRST CONFERENCE ON MESOAMERICAN ETHNOHISTORY: CODICES AND
MANUSCRIPTS. This symposium is regionally, topically, and temporally focused upon the
documentary sources for the high culture area of native Mexico and Guatemala prior to the
Spanish Conquest. Within this complex region the geographical coverage of the symposium
is broad, and includes central Mexico, Oaxaca, western Mexico, and the Maya and
