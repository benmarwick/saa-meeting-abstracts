, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA

(1) SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE IN RANKED SOCIETIES PART I: RANKING, PRESTIGE, AND EX-
CHANGE. Ranked societies, whose sociopolitical structure is generally less complex than that of
State societies, have long been a focus of study in many areas. In recent years the archaeology of
ranking has been examined more searchingly, on the basis both of settlement and funerary
evidence, and the dynamic relationships between social structure, subsistence production and
mechanisms of exchange have been more closely investigated. In this symposium the case
studies are drawn primarily from European societies of the prehistoric and early Medieval
periods, with the intention of focusing on general issues of culture process under the two general
headings of ranking, prestige and exchange, and, production, distribution, and land-use in ranked
societies.

(2) RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA. This symposium
presents results of some of the most recent archaeological work In Lower Central America.
Papers focus on basic problems including chronology and context, subsistence, settlement, and
regional contacts. The papers make contributions toward understanding cultural evolution in this
region, an understanding which has been severely limited by lack of research.

(3) PLANT OPAL PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS: APPLICATIONS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH.
This symposium is the first ever devoted to phytolith analysis in archaeology. It convenes
analysts who, only within this decade, are pioneering this research individually. Their papers
comprise the “state of the art,” far in advance of available publications. These themes are em-
phasized: field and laboratory techniques; phytolith taxonomy; and, analytical success in studies
of paleoenvironment and subsistence. Archaeological periods from Paleolithic to Historic are in-
cluded. Cultures range from hunters and collectors to early farmers in irrigation civilizations. Ex-
amples from Old and New World archaeology demonstrate the near-universal applicability of
phytolith analysis in multidisciplinary archaeological research.

(4) EXPLANATIONS IN HISTORY: PLAINS HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY. A large quantity of in-
formation about the Euroamerican occupation of the plains geographical area is available from
recent research. This information allows for recognition of patterning in the empirical record.
This patterning can be explained on a number of levels of analysis. This symposium is designed
to draw together a series of papers of varied methodological and theoretical interests on several
of these levels. Explanations of the recognized patterns are presented from intrasite to interre-
gional contexts. The testing of these ideas may result in a greater explanatory potential for future
research into the past Euroamerican occupation, as well as into the working of cultural systems
in general.

(6) COMPUTERIZED DATA BANK MANAGEMENT IN ARCHAEOLOGY. During the past decade ar-
chaeologists have begun to use computerized data banks. Although each application may vary in
specific goals and functions, all face similar mengeyes issues. This symposium presents
several unique examples of how archaeologists are benefiting from computerized data banks and
discusses attendant problems and concerns. Papers range from multi-federal agency coopera-
tive applications to state-wide networks to project specific usages. Trends in new computer tech-
nology and their implications for future archaeological eageeowinds are explored.

(7) PROBLEMS OF LARGE SCALE, MULTIDISCIPLINARY REGIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL RE-
SEARCH: THE MALYAN PROJECT. The symposium is organized to provide a discussion of the
theoretical, methodological, and administrative problems addressed by the Malyan Project. The
first group of papers will introduce the project and cover environmental, mineralogical, palaeo-
ethnobotanical, and zooarcheological studies as well as special studies of sealings and
figurines. Here the emphasis will be on analytical techniques peculiar to each study, how these
studies are interrelated and how they are responsive to the general objectives of the project. The
second group of papers will cover studies of regional settlement patterns and functional variation
at Malyan; emphasis will be on analytical problems.

(8) PREHISTORIC HABITAT, AGRICULTURE, AND SETTLEMENT OF THE PULLTROUSER
SWAMP ZONE, NORTHERN BELIZE. The controversial ground patterns reported in various inun-
dated zones in the Maya lowlands are examined for a large multihabitat depression in northern
Belize. Interdisciplinary work Indicates that the patterns are Maya-made raised fields and canals
of sophisticated construction and function, that current environmental circumstances are similar
to those which occurred in the past, that natural ground patterns do not form in the depression,
and that the adjacent population was large.

, (9) ASCA SYMPOSIUM: ARCHAEOLOGY IN STATE PLANNING FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION.
State historic preservation plans link federal and state programs for the protection of archaeolog-
ical resources, just as such plans guide programs for historic sites and districts. How Can broad-
ly based professional expertise from the archaeological community be integrated into historic
preservation planning? The symposium will highlight pliot projects in Arkansas and Massachu-
setts; will address future directions and alternatives in planning as it affects archaeological re-
mains; and will discuss the relationships between state historic preservation planning and the
missions of federal agencies which have protection of archaeological sites among their goals.
(10) CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL SHELF. This sym-
posium provides an introduction to the Cultural Resource Management Program on the Outer
Continental Shelf, OCS, which has been developed by the Bureau of Land Management, BLM,
Department of Interior. Management of cultural resources on the OCS has resulted in a long-
range planning program focusing on the protection of prehistoric and historic marine cultural
resources that has been designed to Insure that federal and federally permitted activities and
projects do not cause avoidable damage or loss of these resources. The development of the OCS
program, its structure, and functions will be discussed, and the nature of the four field areas—
Atlantic, Gulf Coast, Pacific, and Alaska—wili be explained. Recent and current projects are
described and the future of the program is discussed.
(11) ARCHAEOMAGNETISM: PROSPECTS FOR IMPROVING TIME CONTROL IN ARCHAEOL-
OGY. This symposium has been designed by archaeomagnetic specialists to (1) apprise each
other of current developments in technique and analysis, and (2) communicate the current poten-
tial of archaeomagnetism to the archaeological community. Important advances are reported In
field collection technique, theory of thermoremanent magnetism, and statistical analysis. To
assess the practical archaeological uses of archaeomagnetism, papers on archaeomagnetic ap-
plication and prospects for intensity dating are presented, and information exchange between ar-
chaeologists and geophysicists is discussed.
(12) SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE IN RANKED SOCIETIES PART II: PRODUCTION, DISTRIBU-
TION, AND LAND-USE. See (1).
(14) ARTIFACT ANALYSIS AND BEHAVIORAL INFERENCE. This symposium discusses the In-
ferential steps between research design and Interpretation. The papers focus on the way analysis
is structured to meet research goals, how and why attributes or variables were selected. The
analysis of a variety of materials is discussed: stone, bone, ceramics, and metal. Although !!-
justrations are drawn from the Neolithic site of Selevac (Yugoslavia) and the Neolithic levels at
Les Tambourets (France), the problems discussed are faced by all archaeologists—how to select
and analyze attributes meaningful in the interpretation of past behavior.
(15) EARLY COASTAL ADAPTATIONS IN THE CENTRAL AREA AND ADJACENT REGIONS.
Papers and discussion focus on the nature and origins of early cultural adaptations to coastal
«zones along the Pacific shores of Panama, Ecuador, and northern Peru; additional information is
provided by scholars working In Mexico and the Caribbean. Speakers will address several
specific questions in addition to presenting thelr particular data and interpretations. These ques-
tlons concern (1) the antiquity and origins of coastal adaptations; (2) the nature of the sub-
sistence base and how it may have changed; (3) the evidence for post-Pleistocene climate change
and the origins of coastal adaptations; (4) the role of the early coastal peoples In the development
of the formative way of life in the Central Area.
(17) CHIPPED STONE ANALYSIS AND THE RECONSTRUCTION OF PREHISTORIC SUB-
SISTENCE SYSTEMS. This symposium brings together diverse approaches to the study of
chipped stone that attempt to establish the bases for inferring tool use and to reconstruct
prehistoric subsistence-settlement systems. Recent functional analyses of chipped stone tools
have contributed to methods of determining tool function on the basis of micro- and macro-
analyses of edge characteristics. This approach has been productive and stimulating; the unit of
analysis has generally been individual tools. The papers In this symposium include archaeolog-
ical and experimental studies aimed at integrating detailed functional analyses into the broader
perspective of subsistence-settlement systems.
(18) COLHA, BELIZE: A CHERT TOOL MASS PRODUCTION CENTER OF THE ANCIENT MAYA
LOWLANDS. For the first time, the role of chert tools in the development of Maya society can be
assessed. This has been made possible by the Investigation of a chert tool mass-production
center at the site of Colha, Belize. This large site dates from Middle Preclassic to Early Post-
classic times. Specialized mass production of chert tools can be recognized throughout the se-
26
, quence, particularly in the late Preciassic and In the Early Postclassic. The symposium describes
the findings of the 1979 and 1980 seasons. The nature of the chert-production systems, chronol-
ogy. ceramic studies, architectural research, and subsistence and environmental studies will be
examined.
(21) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE PROTECTION IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR: PROBLEMS AND PRO-
SPECTS. A series of papers on various methods and problems in providing protection to archae-
ological sites on private land Is presented. Particularly stressed are easements and outright ac-
quisition as protection methods.
(22) ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE WIDER AUDIENCE. Archaeologists have fraquentiy ignored the
general public and have, like other specialists, lagged behind in their efforts to communicate with
lay people and to work effectively with interested amateur archaeologists. This panel explores the
difficulties of popularizing archaeology, and some of the strategies used In the United States and
elsewhere to work with and train amateur archaeologists. Four position papers will be followed
by a lengthy panel discussion, in which experts at communicating archaeology to 4 wider au-
dience will participate.
(26) ADVANCES IN STUDYING REGIONAL EXCHANGE SYSTEMS. The symposium will concen-
trate on methodological concerns in studying prehistoric exchange. Previous research has dealt
with notions of exchange such as reciprocity and redistribution which are both too general and
not operational archaeologically. To redirect studies of exchange our goal is to identify issues
that can be Investigated concretely. The variable effects of boundaries, transportation systems,
types of goods, and different social context assume importance. The conditions that lead to the
development of exchange are best viewed through the modes of consumption and production.
The symposium will emphasize the development of techniques to investigate these issues.
(27) NEW PERSPECTIVES ON MOGOLLON PREHISTORY—THE MIMBRES AND RESERVE
BRANCHES. Recent research In the areas occupied by the Mimbres and Reserve Branches of the
Mogollon Is enabling the reevaluation of certain ideas about these people. The session begins
with a reexamination of the Branch concept and its use as a means of differentiating various
cultural complexes. Chronological issues such as the validity of particular phases are also con-
sidered. Delineation of settlement patterns and explanations of the processes involved in their
changes are discussed. Three major settlement periods are examined: the pithouse period, the
sedentary and growth period, and the abandonment and aggregation period. Modifications in the
subsistence base are studied as a means of explaining shifts in settlement patterns. Reassess-
ment of the history of cultigen development In the study area is also presented, Finally, issues of
trade, exchange, and pottery production are examined.
(28) THE SOUTHEAST MESOAMERICAN PERIPHERY: COPAN AND QUIRIGUA. The papers
presented in this symposium are based upon results of work recently completed at the Maya
centers of Copan and Quirigua. While these papers will be concerned with the presentation of
this newly gathered data, the primary emphasis of, the contributions will be on synthesis and in-
terpretation. The categories of data examined here} glyphic inscriptions, art and iconography, ar-
chitectural style and sequence, ceramics and settlement patterns, will be considered with
respect to intrasite prehistoric economic, political, and social processes. The relationships be-
tween centers will also be considered.
(29) SITE SURVEY IN SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND: TOWARD A SETTLEMENT MODEL. In recent
years the archaeological record of southern New England has been systematically examined by a
number of investigators. This work has been characterized by an emphasis on prehistoric sub-
sistence and settlement analysis with a predictive and explanatory model as the ultimate goal.
This symposium proposes to bring together people involved In major ongoing Sova neC ISI and
those responsible for state and federal funding. Our goal is to facilitate communication among
those working toward a regional settlement model as well as fo inform the archaeological com-
munity of our methodologies and research results.
(31) THE DOLORES ARCHEOLOGICAL PROGRAM, SW COLORADO. The scale of very large
mitigation studies such as the Dolores Archeological Program permits an effective regional and
multidisciplinary approach to the reconstruction of past lifeways and to the study of process in
\inked cultural and environmental systems. Such large projects also raise special problems of
managing data, personnel, and research operations. This symposium summarizes selected re-
search results from the Dolores Archeological Program after nearly 2 years of operation, and
reports on this project's approach to the opportunities and problems of large-scale archaeolog-
ical studies.
27
, (32) CUELLO 1980: PRELIMINARY PAPERS. The Early Formative Maya site of Cueilo, Belize, has
yleided much new information on the settlement, ceramics, economy, and trade of an early
sedentary society In the Mesoamerican tropical lowlands. Excavations of 1976-79 have been con-
tinued in 1980 with the exposure of further large areas of Early Formative architecture and asso-
ciated features; these are discussed in the several papers of this symposium.
(36) LOCATIONAL MODELS: IMPLICATIONS AND ALTERNATIVES. This symposium is intended
to offer Insights into current applications of locational models In archaeology. While the topics
may be limited in scope, the papers presented In this session are designed to focus on (1) possl-
ble favorable or adverse implications of some models, or (2) alternative approaches. Ecological,
organizational and regional spatial relationships will be addressed. The symposium Is designed
to develop critical reviews and ideas about the use of locational models in the study of intersite
relationships.
(38) SOIL AND PATTERNS OF PAST HUMAN BEHAVIOR. The symposium, sponsored by the Soll
Banque, will focus on the methodologies that can be used to analyze anthropogenic soll and infer
patterns of past human behavior. The participants constitute an international pane) of research-
ers interested in soil analysis. The sedimentary structure and blogeochemical and geochemical
composition of the soil appear to be important indicators of past human activities. The contribu-
tors present a number of illustrations of the potential of soil analysis Including land use, con-
struction, location of site perimeters and specific activity areas, and plant and animal use. Since
the soll undergoes continuous transformations, several papers examine the nature and agents in-
volved in dynamic change. The symposium provides an overview of existing and new methods,
and |ilustrates the rich potential of these lines of Investigation.
(39) THE SOUTHEAST MESOAMERICAN PERIPHERY: WESTERN HONDURAS AND EL
SALVADOR. Ongoing and recently completed archaeological projects in Honduras and El
Salvador are extending our knowledge of the Southeast Periphery of Mesoamerica. The papers
presented here deal with several of these projects and thelr aspects: settlement, chronology,
trade, and communications networks. in addition, the ceramics of Quirigua, Copan, and other
areas of the Periphery are compared and discussed. The papers’ temporal span is the Middle Pre-
classic to the Terminal Postclassic, Throughout, emphasis will be placed on intra- and inter-
regional! development and relationships.
(40) THE FORT ANCIENT TRADITION: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE LATE PREHISTORY OF THE
MIDDLE OHIO VALLEY. It is difficult to fit recently acquired data on Fort Ancient into the existing
archaeological construct(s). Griffin's Fort Ancient Aspect (1943) and Prufer and Shane's Fort An-
clent Tradition (1970) have assumed far greater internal homogeneity and historical relatedness of
phases than data now support. Fort Ancient can no longer be viewed as a series of primarily
ceramic diachronic stages that reflect both Mississippian intrusion and the increasing Missis-
sippianization of a relatively homogeneous autochthonous Woodland population. The greater
diversity observable in recent research on Fort Ancient requires formulation of an alternative
model of Fort Ancient, making explicit those consequences of the paradigm by which it is struc-
‘tured, and illustrating those archaeological and historical data that it must encompass.

(41) THE SIMPLE AND COMPLEX SOCIETIES OF WEST AND NORTHWEST MEXICO: PART I.
West and northwest Mexico have long been considered peripheral to the events and processes
that formed Mesoamerican civilization. The abundant archaeological, ethnohistorical, and ethno-
archaeological data that nave been assembied In recent years not only expand our knowledge of
the area's culture history, but demonstrate that its precontact cultures were far more complex
than previously thought. Data also show that these areas were important to developments in the
Mesoamerican “heartiand" and may hold the key to a better understanding of Mesoamerican-
Southwestern relationships. The native peoples of the area today are a rich source of information
for archaeologists.
(42) COMING OF AGE IN ARKANSAS: THIRTEEN YEARS OF THE ARKANSAS ARCHEOLOGICAL
SURVEY. The accomplishments and shortcomings of the Arkansas Archeological Survey, a
pioneering institution in its state-wide approach to archaeological research and cultural resource
management, are presented In papers and reviewed by a panel of discussants. The papers in-
clude both summaries of regional prehistory within Arkansas and topical subjects, such as ar-
chaeomagnetic dating, contract archaeology, rock art, the amateur certification program, and
historical archaeology In the State. Research accomplishments at the Parkin and Toltec sites, as
well as plans for future investigations, are presented.

| (43) FROM FLINT RIDGE TO VERA CRUZ: LITHIC RESOURCES IN THE NORTHEAST. In recent

28
, years, archaeologists have demonstrated considerable interest in discovering and analyzing
sources of stone used by prehistoric people in the Northeast. Quarries were an Important and In-
tegral part of prehistoric economies, and many stone materials also entered prehistoric trade
systems. This symposium will draw together for the first time many of the people concerned with
lithic resources In the region. Formal papers will highlight areas of current research, such as
characterization of sources and analysis of quarry activities. The symposium will also offer an
opportunity for informal exchange of Information about, and samples from, important Northeast
iithic sources.
(44) ENERGY AND ARCHAEOLOGY: RESPONSE TO A NATIONAL PRIORITY. In light of the Presi-
dent's message regarding development of new energy resources, federal agencies and the ar-
chaeological community must reassess their stance on cultural resource issues. The symposium
will allow various state and federal agency archaeologists to discuss plans and procedures, as
well as potential problems they perceive for the continuing protection of cultural resources. Com-
ments and discussion from the audience will be actively encouraged In an effort to provide a pro-
ductive exchange of dialogue on these pertinent issues.
(45) AMERICAN INDIANS AND ARCHAEOLOGY TODAY. Contemporary Native Americans are in-
creasingly taking action and gaining attention in regard to their special Interests, needs, and con-
cerns for their archaeological heritage. Some of these Indian points-of-view are presented, partic-
ularly on recent legislation affecting the excavation and disposition of Indian sacred sites and
materials, and human remains, Tribal-archaeologica!l dialogue and collaboration are increasing:
several policies, investigations, and programs of mutual benefit to both American Indian cultural
heritage and to archaeology are described.
(48) CONTEMPORARY ANDEAN CULTURAL CONTINUITY THROUGH ARCHAEOLOGICAL IN-
QUIRY., Recent studies of contemporary patterns of Andean behavior, socioeconomic organiza-
tion and classificatory principles are presented. Each participant archaeologically examines a
different indigenous group. The purpose of the symposium is to measure and evaluate the tem-
poral and spatial variability of specific Andean behavioral and cognitive patterns, reflected
through the utilization, distribution, and classification of material goods. The goal of each partici-
pant is to demonstrate that these patterns represent vestiges of cultural continuity in Andean
social, economic, and ideational structures, and to explain past behavioral patterns in the ar-
chaeological record.
(47) EXCAVATION AT THE SHAWNEE MINISINK SITE; REPORTS ON 11,000 YEARS OF CUL-
TURAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL HISTORY IN EASTERN NORTH AMERICA. The focus of this sym-
posium is a report on research undertaken by the Upper Delaware Valley Early Man Project in
northeastern Pennsylvania. Excavation at the Shawnee-Minisink site, located at the confluence
of the Delaware River and Brodhead Creek about 3 km northwest of the Delaware Water Gap, re-
vealed deeply stratified cultural components spanning from Paleoindian to Late Woodland
periods. Extensive paleoecological and subsistence data were also recovered. Research reports
dea! with site excavation methodology, aero sequences, environmental reconstruction,
typological considerations, culture change and protess, and isolation of living tioors in compact
stratigraphy.
(48) CURRENT RESEARCH AT THE ABBOTT FARM NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK. The Ab-
bott Farm Nationa! Historic Landmark, a 1700-acre district located near Trenton, N.J., received
national and international attention in arguments addressing the antiquity of humans in North
America. Current research has turned to its unique Middle Woodland occupations excavated be-
tween 1936 and 1940 In a portion of the landmark called the Abbott Farm. The papers in this sym-
posium are based on studies of excavated materials that had never been analyzed or studied In
detail. The materials assessed are human osteological remains, faunal remains, and argillite ar-
tifacts. Evidence from these studies is combined with other data to form a preliminary settlement
model. ‘
(49) URBAN ARCHAEOLOGY IN PHILADELPHIA. The symposium will focus on Philadelphia as a
single archaeological site that, through the process of urbanization, has undergone considerable
spatial and temporal change. Included within the symposium are six individual papers covering
topics of predictive modeling and sampling, site excavation, artifact patterning, neighborhood
comparisons, the use of historic documentation, and the relationship of urban archaeology to the
concerns of historic preservation. Discussants will focus, first, upon an overview of the develop-
ment and course of Philadelphia urban archaeology, and, second, upon the contributions of
Philadelphia archaeology to general and theoretical research interests concerning processes of
23
, urbanization. A brief Introduction to Philadelphia urban archaeology will precede the presenta-
tlon of papers.
(50) SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC ORGANIZATION IN THE COASTAL ENVIRONMENT,
in an effort to consider theory and Issues in coastal archaeology beyond the traditional
subsistence-orlented research common to many earlier symposia and publications, this sym-
posium will present current studies that discuss general coastal theory published to date,
prehistoric coastal sociopolitical organization, population dynamics, coastal settlement types,
and comparative coastal-inland resource stability and productivity. These presentations serve
well to emphasize the scarcity of most forms of extant research save subsistence-focused
coastal archaeology and provide some examples of fresh approaches to the analysis of social,
political, and economic aspects of coastal adaptations.
(51) SITE LOCATIONAL STRATEGIES IN HEAVILY VEGETATED AREAS. A frequently en-
countered problem In archaeological survey is the existence of heavy ground cover. This problem
is especially prevalent in the southeastern United States or other areas where forest cover Is
prominent and timber harvesting Is a major economic activity. Locational data are crucial to
cultural resource management as well as research into settlement patterning or even sub-
sistence potential. This symposium will provide opportunity for discussion as well as offering a
number of papers presenting current activities and techniques for both the discovery of sites and
the utilization of the data so derived. Emphasis will be on practical problem-oriented anthropolog-
ical approaches to cultural resource management decisions and associated research aims.
(52) COROZAL POSTCLASSIC PROJECT—INTERIM REPORT. Although the Corozal Postclassic
Project session will present the preliminary results of two season’s of excavation in northern
Belize, it is also designed to exemplify the interplay that excavation and scientific analysis can
have in a well-planned archaeological program. in this light, the importance of individual contri-
butions to the whole symposium can be seen through the papers which will be presented. Addi-
tionally, the symposium seeks to address Itself to the theoretical questions that are being investi-
gated. Partial solutions to these theoretical questions, as well as the ways in which they may be
tested and answered, will be proffered,
(53) THE SIMPLE AND COMPLEX SOCIETIES OF WEST AND NORTHWEST MEXICO: PART Il. See
(41).
(57) THE IVORY TOWER IN THE COMMUNITY: SCHOLARSHIP AND THE PUBLIC IN ALEXAN-
DRIA, VIRGINIA. The interplay between academic and community needs Is discussed in relation
to the development and implementation of a public archaeology project within the City of Alexan-
dria, Virginia. Specific papers are presented on the Alexandria Urban Archeology Project's
research and organizational design, survey methods/results, and site excavations; these for-
mulate a city data base for determining historic socloeconomic patterns, model testing, preser-
vation planning, public formats, and volunteer contributions. The four project components of re-
‘ search, management, interpretation, and education are emphasized and their relationships, fund-
ing, and administration are discussed in reference to the goals of public archaeology.
(58) REGIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS: MEASUREMENT, THEORY, AND EXAMPLES. While ar-
chaeologists have become more sophisticated at constructing models for the occurrence of
specific social phenomena, problems remain both in modeling the organizational properties and
in evaluating the models through the Indirect measurement of such properties. The papers in this
symposium examine issues underlying the idea of archaeologically measuring properties of
social networks and/or give examples of developing and applying specific measurements to
societies at various levels of organizational complexity.
(59) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF A FRONTIER: RECENT STUDIES IN EL SALVADOR PREHISTORY.
Current and recently completed investigations in E| Salvador have both enlarged our picture of
events on the southern periphery of Mesoamerica and suggested that some major changes in
viewpoint about this area are in order. Some of these new data will be presented and thelr impor-
tance and bearing on problems in Mesoamerican and Central American studies will be discussed
by three persons with exceptional experience in the prehistory of both Meso- and Central
America.

, Abstracts of Papers
Abernathy, Leslie C. (Arkansas Arch. Survey) THE OTHER FOUR AND A HALF CENTURIES:
HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN ARKANSAS The 450 years of the changing human presence in
Arkansas after Columbus provide research opportunities that encompass the entire range of
problem-oriented historical archaeology. The statewide focus of the Arkansas Archeological
Survey is encouraging an awareness of these historical research opportunities and needs. The
guidance for research provided by a recently completed consideration of state-level research
design incorporates an operational definition of the field of historical archaeology as a technique
best undertaken in a research environment tied to an appreciation of holistic, relative, and
dynamic perspectives vital to the anthropological viewpoint. Specific historical projects are sum-
marized. (42)
Abrams, George H. J. (Seneca-lroquois National Museum) AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGION, LAW
AND MUSEUMS Major legislation and court cases, passed and pending, directly relate to the
area of American Indian material culture. These laws address themselves to the subject of Ameri-
can Indian religion, “cultural sensitivity,” and the return of items often ambiguously defined as
“religious.” These include items of osteological material, grave goods, and ethnographic
material held by universities, museums, and in private collections. This presentation discusses
current status, suggestions for possible avenues of cooperation, and the implications of such
laws as the American Indian Religious Freedom Act of 1978 and the Archeological Resources
Protection Act of 1979, especially as these apply to the tribes in the Northeast United States. (45)
Accola, Richard M. (Texas-Austin) INTER- AND INTRA-COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION OF THE
RESERVE PHASE MOGOLLON OF THE MIDDLE SAN FRANCISCO RIVER REGION Recent
survey of Reserve Phase (ca. A.D, 1000-1100/1150) occupations in the middle San Francisco River
drainage region has supplied data focused on the spatial organization of Mogollon communities.
Relationships between sites situated along the river and those located in upland regions are
discussed. Spatial layout of different features within naturally defined areas are analyzed in
terms of their social organization. Hypotheses for future research in the area are presented. (27)
Adams, John (see Hansell, Patricia) (5)
Adams, R. E. W. (Texas, San Antonio) and Fred Valdez Jr. (Harvard) THE CERAMICS OF COLHA,
1979-1980 SEASONS Two seasons of ceramic analyses at the site of Colha, Belize, have provided
data on a ceramic sequence beginning at ca. 600 B.C. (Mamom sphere) and terminating al Ca.
A.D. 1250 (New Town sphere). Strong ceramic developments are seen in Chicanel (Late Pre-
classic) and Early Postclassic times, perhaps correlated with periods of intensive lithic produc-
tion and export. (18)
Adovasio, J. M. and W. C. Johnson inborn the APPEARANCE OF CULTIGENS IN THE UP-
PER OHIO VALLEY: A VIEW FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER Meadowcroft Rockshelter
is a deeply stratified multicomponent site in Washington County, southwestern Pennsylvania.
The 11 well-defined stratigraphic units identified at the site span at least 16,000, and perhaps
19,000, years of intermittent occupation by gréups representing all of the major cultural
stages/periods now recognized in northeastern North America. Though predominantly known for
the Paleoindian components associated with lower and middle Stratum Ila, of comparable sig-
nificance are the early cultigens recovered from Stratum IV. The lower occupational floors in this
level, dated between 870 + 75 B.C. and 705 + 120 B.C., yielded Cucurbita sp. in gndisturbed con-
texts while the upper floors in this unit produced ears of 16 row Zea mays, dated between 375 + 75
and 340 + 90 B.C. The attributes of these, the earliest well-dated cultigens in the Upper Ohio
Valley, as well as the associated artifacts are summarized, and the implications of these
materials for the appearance and dispersal of cultigens in the study area are discussed. (33)
Adovasio, James M. (see Johnson, William C.) (40)
Agurcia F., Ricardo A. (San Pedro Sula) LATE CLASSIC SETTLEMENTS IN THE COMAYAGUA
VALLEY A series of Late Classic sites in the Comayagua Valley of Central Honduras are analyzed
in terms of the spatial distribution and composition of the architectural remains within them. The
patterns observed are compared to those of contemporaneous settlements from better known
areas. Much of the data presented is new for the Central Honduran Highlands and comes from
surface surveys. (39)

:
, Albright, Shirley S. and Lorraine E. Williams (New Jersey State Museum) DIFFERENTIATION OF
FINE-GRAINED SEDIMENTARY AND METAMORPHIC ROCKS UTILIZED BY PREHISTORIC POP-
ULATIONS OF THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION The identification of artifacts made of fine-grained
sedimentary and metamorphic rocks can be accomplished through a combination of petro-
graphic techniques. The examination of grain size and boundary will differentiate siltstones and
shales from detrital or chemical argillites, slates and hornfelsed rocks. Indurated and metamor-
phosed specimens can be distinguished via x-ray diffraction. Synthesized extant geological data
in combination with field studies permit the mapping of prehistoric quarry locations. Petro-
graphic analyses of fine-grained artifacts from New Jersey, coastal New York and the Hudson
Valley permit studies of the procurement and utilization of argillite and hornfels by prehistoric
populations from Archaic through Woodland times. (43)
Albright, Shirley S. (see Wiliams, Lorraine E.) (48)
Alden, John R. (Duke) BANESH PERIOD SETTLEMENT The Banesh Period (3400-2600 B.C.) marks
the introduction of lowland populations and sociopolitical concerns into the Kur Basin. Popula-
tion size and regional organization are discussed for each of the period's five phases. The settle-
ment patterns indicate an initial phase of immigration into the region which was probably related
to the expansion of long-distance trade. This is followed by a period of slow growth, a second
wave of immigration and a period of internationalism, and finally by a phase of regional isolation
and gradual population decline. (7)
Allen, Raiph (see Nagle, Christopher) (43)
Ames, Kenneth M. (Boise State) THE DEVELOPMENT OF VILLAGES IN WESTERN NORTH
AMERICA Clusters of pithouses appear in various portions of western North America between
6000 and 4000 years before present, among nonagriculturalists in the Great Basin, Intermontane
Plateau, and Pacific Coast. It is argued in this paper that (1) present theoretical and operational
definitions of villages used in these areas are inadequate; (2) that as pithouses are widely
distributed in time and space, their presence cannot be explained by reference to particular
cultural or historical traditions. Villages are precipitated from the conjunction of intensifiable
resources and particular population structures. (3) Pithouse clusters are temporally unstable and
the processes that bring them into being are not the processes that may maintain them for long
periods of time. (20)
Anyon, Roger and Patricia A. Gilman (New Mexico) A RE-EVALUATION OF THE MIMBRES-
MOGOLLON ARCHAEOLOGICAL SEQUENCE Recent work in the Mimbres Valley of New Mexico
has altered the published archaeological sequence. A previously unrecognized early plainware
pithouse periods has been identified and dated at A.D. 200-500. A new series of radiocarbon and
tree-ring dates has modified the dates of the phases between A.D. 550-1000, and changed the ter.
tinal date of the Classic Mimbres to A.D. 1150. The traditionally accepted Mangus phase is now
shown to be non-existent. These refinements of the sequence and the recognition of cultural con-
: tinuity throughout the occupation of the area negate any notion of an Anasazi takeover at A.D.
1000. (27)
Anzalone, Ronald D. (HCRS) THE ARCHAEOLOGIST AS “ENVIRONMENTALIST”: USING AND
ABUSING NEPA If archaeologists are to have an effective voice in energy development and other
national development programs in the future, they should be aware of how the National Environ-
mental Policy Act has both supported and failed archaeology in the decade since its passage.
State and federal agency planning priorities and the extent to which they become involved in ar-
chaeological programs obviously vary depending on their missions, land managing responsi-
bilities, and the specific locations and types of projects they undertake or support. However, as
generally recognized by the Council on Environmental Quality's new regulations, the key to the
fullest possible consideration of archaeological resources thoughout the country is the involve-
ment of archaeological interests as early as possible in the planning process. (44)

Armelagos, George J. and Alan A. Goodman (Massachusetts-Amherst) THE USE OF SKELETAL
MATERIALS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF STRESS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL POPULATIONS Patterns of
morbidity provide methods for the analysis of stress in archaeological populations. Skeletal in-
dicators of infection and nutritional deficiency are used as measures of a population's health and
adaptation. The frequency and severeity of porotic hyperostosis (iron deficiency anemia),
premature osteoporosis (bone demineralization), Harris lines, and enamel hypopiasias are
especially effective markers of nutritional stress. The use of these markers is applied to a pop-
32
, ulation undergoing rapid subsistence change. Research on the Dickson Mounds Population (II-
linois, 950-1300 A.D.) shows a significant increase in infectious and nutritional stress with
changes to primary food production. (63)
Arnold, Christopher J. (Leeds) STRESS AS A STIMULUS FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE:
ANGLO-SAXON ENGLAND IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY A.D. An example of rapid change in
socioeconomic structure as the result of internal and external stress is analyzed. The social,
economic and religious structure of Anglo-Saxon England in the seventh century A.D. underwent
a dramatic change which has been accepted but not understood by archaeologists. It is argued
that the changes were the result of stress placed upon a rapidly evolved ranked social structure
within a nonmarket economy. These changes resulted in a more ranked society and a market
economy which emerged after a period of economic recession. (1)
Arnoid, Dean E. (Wheaton) CERAMIC STYLISTIC CORRELATES OF A COMMUNITY OF POTTERS
IN QUINUA, PERU Aithough systems archaeologists argue that ceramic style can provide infor-
mation about social structure, few ethnographic data support this assumption. The results of an
etic behavioral analysis of design features of Quinua pottery indicate that aspects of style which
have a high frequency in the sampled categories appear to be coincidental with the stylistic con-
ventions of the community. Conventions include design structures, specific types of motif and
band symmetry, and the association of particular designs with specific design zones. These data
suggest that the use of design elements in ceramic style analysis rather than design structure
and symmetry will miss important information that may have social structure correlates. (46)
Arnold, Jeanne E (UC-Santa Barbara) THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR COASTAL ADAP-
TATIONS This presentation identifies and synthesizes the theoretical issues which have ap-
peared in published reports to date on coastal adaptations worldwide. Unfortunately, it is found
that little effort has been expended among published archaeologists to either employ extant
general anthropological theory or to frame coastal research in a manner encouraging the genera-
tion and application of a uniquely coastal body of theory, or at least a specific analytical ap-
proach and structure for the study of coastal adaptations. Several variables and hypotheses rele-
vant to the development of a theoretical structure for coastal archaeology are discussed in
response to this void in the literature. (50)
Arundale, Wendy Hanford (AHP-CPSU, Alaska) A CHALLENGE IN RESEARCH DESIGN: THE
ALASKA NATIVE HISTORIC SITES PROJECT The Alaska Native Historic Sites Project makes
some special demands on its research design. Two research design concepts help the project
meet these special requirements: (1) a flexible design format incorporating a Parent Design and
Offspring Design and Offspring Designs and (2) a design matrix specifying levels of inquiry and
problem domains. This paper discusses these two concepts and provides examples of how they
work. It also suggests how these concepts may be useful to other projects with similar special re-
quirements. (24)
Ashmore, Wendy (Pennsylvania) THE erent SETTLEMENT AT QUIRIGUA The existence
of a lowland Maya elite center at Quirigua during Late Classic times (ca. A.D. 600-900) has been
recognized for some time. Only within the last five years, however, has information emerged that
bears on the size and structuring of the local resident population, and on antecedent occupations
of the floodplain. This paper first presents an overview of the organization of settlement at
Quirigua, primarily in socioeconomic terms, withfeference principally to the Late Classic, Atten-
tion is then given to newly discovered data on Early Classic occupation, affording a diachronic
perspective for a summary interpretation of the roles and raisons d'etre of this Maya center. (39)
Aten, Lawrence E. (Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service) HISTORIO, PRESERVATION
PLANNING: THE NEED AND PROMISE The process of providing answers to the fundamental
planning questions necessary for historic preservation to participate in land-use management
decisions has a high potential for conflict and a low capacity for conflict resolution, This situa-
tion must be resolved if social penalties are to be avoided. Use of systems-based planning
models seems to offer the major prospect for an efficient planning interface between technical
disciplines in historic preservation and land use management So that historic preservation will be
able to compete with major forces such as fiscal comparison, inflation, and energy development
in the coming decade. (9)

Banks. Thomas J. (California) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY BY MULE-BACK A man on a mule can
cover 4 to 6 times more land than a man on foot when looking for archaeological sites. In contract
archaeology this can mean a tremendous economic savings to the company and client. Efficien-
cy in ground coverage is not sacrificed, but rather increased due to less fatigue and better visibili-
ty. Test situations have been conducted where bipedal surveyors and mule-back surveyors
covered the same ground, mule-back surveyors have located more sites than their opposition and
in less time. (5)

COUNTY, VIRGINIA A cultural resource inventory was undertaken in a highly vegetated area of
Wise County, Virginia, A variety ot survey strategies were utilized including the application of site
location predictive models as developed in similar areas of restricted surface visibility. Existing
models. however, fail to consider the presence of distinctive geomorphological features, in this
case rock shelters, which alter settlement patterning. It appears that attributes utilized in other
studies to predict the location of prehistoric sites (close proximity to water, high order streams,
stream intersections, level terrain) are not pertinent to the area. Additional altering geomor-
phological features are suggested. (51)
Barker, Graeme (Sheffield) SOCIO-ECONOMIC CHANGE VERSUS THE ITALIAN PEASANT
Although the prehistory of central Italy has traditionally been regarded as a sequence of increas-
ingly complex systems of technology, subsistence, resource exchange, and social organization,
it can now be seen that periods of sudden and profound change alternated with periods of great
stability. All neolithic societies here have normally been characterized as egalitarian, but in fact
many of them had achieved considerable ranking by the fourth millennium B.C. On the other
hand, many communities were still fundamentally the same as these three thousand years later,
at the end of the prehistoric era. Why did ranked peasant societies develop when and where they
‘did in central Italy, and what kept society in general so stable for so long? (12)
Barnes, Mark R. (Technical Preservation Services/HCRS) THE HISTORIC PRESERVATION FUND
The Historic Preservation Fund, established by the 1966 National Historic Preservation Act, is a
matching grants-in-aid program, administered by individual State Historic Preservation offices.
Since the program's inception, these funds have been used to acquire and develop for public in-
terpretation a number of major prehistoric and historic archaeological sites, Recently, however,
the aims and types of eligible projects have been expanded to meet the needs of the archaeolog-
ical resources and the profession. (44)
Barnes, Mark R. (Heritage Conservation & Recreation Service) PRESERVATION OF ARCHAEO-
LOGICAL SITES THROUGH ACQUISITION Fee Simple acquisition is the best means of preserv-
ing an archaeological site or district. As a preservation tool it offers the archaeologist an oppor-
tunity to protect sites important for both their research and public education value. There current-
ly exist several federal agencies, state and local entities, and private groups which fund the pur-
chasing of archaeological sites. This paper is intended to inform the archaeological community
of some of the possibilities to them beyond salvaging the data or losing the site. (21)
Basalik, Kenneth J. (Temple) URBAN PATTERNING IN PHILADELPHIA This study tests the ap-
plicability of quantitive methods in the interpretation of localized urban contexts. By utilizing the
functionally structured quantitative method of Stanley South, the author identifies patterning in
the sealed contexts of several well and privy structures excavated at Franklin Court in Philadel-
phia. The patterns demonstrate temporal change in the archaeological record reflective of an
34
, ongoing process of cultural and behavioral change. Comparison of these patterns with South's
Carolina Pattern reveals close similarities. These similarities reinforce the concept of a unified
British-American cultural complex on the east coast of North America in the late eighteenth cen-
tury. The hypothesis, suggested by Cosans (1974), rejecting behavioral implications of well and
privy fill, is thus refuted. (49)

Baudez, Claude F. (Proyecto Arqueologico Copan) ICONOGRAPHY AND HISTORY AT COPAN
The monumental sculpture at Copan experiences major changes as much in technique and style
as in iconography during the first years of the reign of 18 Rabbit. On the stelae, the ruler seems to
play a larger role than in the past, amidst a more complex cosmogony which emphasizes dual-
ism. At the same time, zoomorphic altars replace the geometric, earlier ones; later they will
gather growing importance, bearing inscriptions and slaborate scenes, to the prejudice of the
stelae, which seem to vanish. (28)

period in West Mexico, our project is attempting to correlate ethnohistorical information with
that of archaeology for certain groups who lived in Jalisco and Zacatecas in the sixteenth cen-
. tury. The study began with the Cocas and Tecuexes. By investigating early sources we identified
towns they occupied and established maps of their regions. At the same time available informa-
tion about their cultures was assembled. A survey is in progress of archaeological sites believed
to represent those ancient towns. Through comparative studies of site maps, architectural
features, and surface material, we are attempting to identify remains of the various groups. (41)
. Bayham, Frank E. (Arizona State) THE EFFECT OF SEDENTISM ON ANIMAL PROCUREMENT AT
. VENTANA CAVE Investigations of the nonworked faunal material from Ventana Cave, Arizona
(Haury 1950), reveal a dramatic change in the proportional representation of species through
time. Early horizons (Archaic/Cochise) contain a much greater number of small species, such as
jackrabbits, while later horizons contain a preponderance of large desert artiodactyls.
Hypotheses purporting to account for this difference are derived from ecological models of op-
timal diet and focus on the relationship between sdgioeconomic organization and foraging
sehavior as is manifest at cave localities. It is concluded that the change in pattern of animal ex-
ploitation at Ventana Cave is due to a regional shift to a sedentary settlement pattern. (55)

ANALYSIS OF CLASSIC PAINTED CERAMICS IN THE SOUTHEAST MAYA AREA Cooperative
research undertaken by several archaeological projects is summarized according to several
goals: (1) definition of Classic period southeast Maya ceramic units based upon typological and
compositional criteria; (2) the chronological and spatial determination of a southeast teramic
region; and (3) the reconstruction of past economic and sociopolitical interactions in the south-
east region. Particular type-variety units, defined by the current research programs, were selected
for their widespread distribution in this area and for their distinctive paste and stylistic attributes.
These typological units were then tested by compositional analysis, neutron activation Sup-
plemented with petrographic examination carried out in collaboration with Brookhaven National
Laboratories. (39)

Beckerman, Ira C. (Penn State) THE USE OF OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY IN DEVELOPING
PREDICTIVE SETTLEMENT MODELS Predictive settlement pattern models have, in the past, suf-
fered from the lack of theory of misapplication of ecological theory. Optimal foraging theory has
great potential in the development of a theory of settlement and subsistence. The definition of an
optimal diet as one which maximizes net energy per unit time is operationalizable into both sub-
sistence expectations and into a geographical problem of optimal site location. The latter is
developed through the use of soil survey data, and an algorithm Is presented to yield spatial ex-
pectations. (35)

tions on one city block in the historic district of Alexandria, Virginia, provide a controlled archae-
ological data base for studying middle class households in an urban setting. Asyncretic analysis
of several categories of archaeological remains from the excavation permits a broad-based
reconstruction of patterns in subsistence and material culture. Changes in these patterns within
archaeologically defined components can be successfully correlated with documentary evidence
of social and economic change for associated households. A preservation need was thus
coupled with a research requirement—the creation of a data base for comparing with other socio-
economic strata and for testing behavioral models. (57)
Benson, Charlotte L. (Washington) APPLICATIONS OF SERIATION IN COMMUNITY PATTERN
ANALYSIS The utility of seriation in community pattern definition is demonstrated with surface
collections from prehistoric Pueblo sites in southeast Utah. Seriation is shown to have particular
applications in the explanations of culture change (as well as description of cultural variability)
such as colonization, abandonment, population mobility, dispersion, and culture contact. Uses
for seriation in community pattern delineation are clearly demonstrated in a culture periphery
situation such as the northern Anasazi frontier. Potential contributions of seriation method to
community pattern studies, and questions of seriation epistemology are considered. (35)
Berman, Mary Jane (Binghamton) THE ABANDONMENT PROCESS: A CASE STUDY FROM WEST-
CENTRAL NEW MEXICO The abandonment of the upper Gila drainage during the 12th and 13th
centuries has long perplexed archaeologists. Deteriorating climate, invading nomads, disease,
famine, lack of adequate agricultural land capable of supporting the population, breakdown of ex-
change relationships, and inter-pueblo strife have all been suggested as causal factors. This
study evaluates the validity of these arguments. An alternate model of abandonment employing
‘ settlement, hydological, edaphic, climatological, burial, floral and faunal information is
presented and tested on excavation and Survey data from the Apache Creek Valley, west-central
New Mexico. (27)

FUNCTIONAL DIVERSITY This paper examines the functional diversity present ina class of lithic

case study materials from eleven different prehistoric sites in Guanacaste, Costa Rica. Micro-
wear features, as well as the observation of large scale formal attributes, are used in the inter-
pretation of function. It is suggested that the celts included in this study, a5 4 class, had at least
five separate functions. A number of technical considerations relevant to the study of ground
stone tools are discussed. (56)

Recent research in Owens Valley, eastern California, approaches the problem by analyzing th

A DIACHRONIC MODEL Changes over time in settlement behavior and land-use strategies in
prehistoric and early historic Greece is linked to parallel socioeconomic developments, in par-
ticular to the rise and elaboration of ranking, via known and inferred patterns of land tenure. In
situations of population pressure, “achieved” statuses based on landed wealth are converted to
“ascribed” formal rank, through such mechanisms as the “client” system and “cargo” redistribu-
tive system, typical for recent peasant societies. (12)

the focus of a paste compositional investigation employing neutron activation and petrographic
examination. Trade is inferred from “compositional centroids” established for sites located
throughout the Maya Lowlands. Analyses of clays from the Maya region have shown sufficient
compositional variability to make the investigation feasible. The sensitivity of the approach per-
mits discrimination between sites as closely spaced as Tikal and Uaxactun. The data base pro-
vides the opportunity to evaluate the covariation between paste characteristics and modes of
decorative style, which leads to the formulation of more restricted economic models of ceramic
exchange. (56)

organization, economics, and resource base quality and productivity. Data derived from the
analysis of six cemeteries spanning 4000 years of history are used to describe the nature and
degree of economic inequality over time. This analysis suggests a number of models of social
organization and its relationship to subsistence base that account for the observed patterns in
the economic evolution of the area. These models are tested using paleoenvironmental data and
general anthropological theory. (50)

studies using trace and minor element characterization are one way to obtain information bear-
ing directly on these exchange mechanisms. The chemical analysis, by instrumental neutron ac-
tivation, of obsidian, ceramics, clay seal impressions, and clay objects from Tal-e Malyan and
several other sites provides the basis for examining exchange in these materials during the late
fourth through the third millenium B.C. in southern Iran. (7)

7 artifacts and debitage from two Thule sites on Somerset Isiand, N.W.T., and pretreatment and

Fort grid. Seven data sets contained attribute descriptions of the 103 sites, and collected ar-
tifacts (bifaces, non-bifaces, potsherds, flakes and spalis, historic artifacts), The seventh data set
consisted of environmental descriptions of the 153 kilometer squares (including the 43 surveyed).
Spatial distributions and artifact environment attribute covariation were studied statistically
through linking the data sets in combinations. Multiple regression predicted numbers of sites,
bifaces, flakes and spalls, and historic artifacts for nonsurveyed squares based on environmental
characteristics recorded for all squares and cultural data from surveyed squares. (62)

Bombin, Miguel (Alberta) PHYTOLITHS AND PAST HUMAN ACTIVITY Phytoliths (plant opals) are
produced by a variety of plants and, particularly in monocots, they have distinctive morphological
attributes. Associated to other indicators, phytoliths recovered from soils and sediments are
proving to be very useful for a more precise reconstruction of past vegetation and related environ-
mental conditions. The record of past human activity can also be enriched by the addition of
phytolith data, from extra-site studies (e.9., burning activities), as well as from the interpretation
of intra-site spatial distribution of these opal corpuscles. The possibility of identification of
cultivated plants through phytolith studies is also critically discussed. (38)
Bonnichsen, Robson (Maine) THE MUNSUNGUN LAKE LITHIC SOURCE REGION A major lithic
source region has been discovered in the Munsungun Lake region in north central Maine. Ordovi-
cian cherts which occur in the Munsungun Lake formation have been extensively exploited since
the end of the ice age. Over eighty sites have been located, including pit mines and workshops. A
sequence of terraces occurs at Munsungun Lake that have yielded sites of Ceramic, Archaic, and
Paleoindian age. This sequence of sites provides evidence in Maine of sites older than 5,200
years and presents the first opportunity to develop a cultural sequence from an interior lake en-
vironmental setting in this region. (43)

Although they purportedly became extinct about a century ago, the history and culture of these
people have been preserved in traditions of the modern Seri. The San Esteban Islanders appear,
however, to have gone unmentioned by the historic European observers. in order to test the
veracity of the Seri traditions, an archaeological survey on San Esteban Island was undertaken;

NATIVE AMERIGAN OSSUARY ON CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS A prehistoric ossuary, dis-
covered during a construction project on Indian Neck in Wellfleet, Massachusetts, is dated to the
Late Woodland period (900-c. 1600 A.D.). The areas contained a late prehistoric or contact period
midden above the ossuary. The midden was stratigraphically separate from the burial levels. The
first level of the burial feature can best be termed an ossuary. Roughly oval in shape with the long
axis north-south, this level contained the disarticulated remains of at least two dozen individuals.
The second level of this feature, a cremation, was a small, somewhat irregular, but densely
packed layer of calcined bone. The Indian Neck Ossuary represents the only known burial of its
type in New England. The best-known example of mass secondary interments is the “Feast of the
Dead" ceremony and subsequent ossuary burial of some lroquoian- and Algonquian-speaking
groups in the Great Lakes area. (33)
Bradley, Richard (Reading) PRESTIGE TRADE, AGRICULTURE AND SOCIAL CHANGE—SOME
EUROPEAN EXAMPLES The consequences of the collapse of ranked societies in different parts
of Europe and the relationship between the intensity of prestige trade and that of agricultural pro-
duction are considered. These represent alternative social investments and are connected with
distinctively different social formations, one relatively ranked and the other relatively egalitarian.
This contrast extends to settlements, cemeteries, ceremonial sites and the landscape. Agricul-
tural intensification in turn creates the basis for the renewed development of ranking. This model
will be illustrated by examples from the Bronze and Iron Ages of Britain, Bohemia and Sweden. (1)

Bricker, Harvey M. (Tulane) THE USES OF THE PAST: NEOLITHIC REWORKING OF PALEO-
LITHIG FLINT ARTIFACTS The site of Les Tambourets, in the French Pyrenees, had two major
prehistoric occupations, Upper Paleolithic and Neolithic. By the Neolithic, the Paleolithic ar-
chaeological level and presumably, many of its flint artifacts, had been extensively exposed by
erosion. Many of these patinated objects were reworked into retouched tools, but their age or
cultural affiliation is not apparent from classical lypoogien diagnosis. Evidence from a multi-

, Bronitsky, Gordon (Texas-Permian Basin) RELIGION IN WEST TEXAS: A MODERN MATERIAL
CULTURE FIELD SCHOOL One recent trend in archaeology has been its redefinition as the study
of human behavior through material culture, regardless of the particular temporal setting. Along
with this has come the realization that archaeological sites are a vanishing resource, a realiza-
tion that has promoted the growth of a conservation ethic in archeology. To incorporate these
trends into teaching and research, a modern material culture field school was conducted to in-
troduce students to archaeology as a way of seeing the world, to teach some of the basic skills
and principles while focusing on the decisions involved in their use, and to create an awareness
of the potentials of modern material culture for the study of religion. (13)
Brooks, Richard H. and Sheilagh T. Brooks (Nevada-Las Vegas) A GAME PEOPLE PLAYED: THE
DISTRIBUTION OF JUGAR A CUATRO IN NORTHWEST MEXICO The game jugar 4 cuatro was de-
scribed first by Lumholtz (1903) in northwestern Mexico, but its origins have been problematical;
was it introduced historically by the Spanish, or do archaeological data substantiate a pre-
Spanish origin? One hypothesis on the game's prehistoric occurrence is that it may have been in-
troduced by the more complex Chalchihuites of Loma San Gabriel cultures into simpler cultures
of Chihuahua and Durango, thereby spreading north and eastward along the Sierra Madre Oc-
cidental. Archaeological survey evidence is presented that extends the ethnographically known
boundaries of the game outside of the Sierra Madres. Prospects are discussed that excavation
might extend the game's distribution into a broader prehispanic context. (53)

Brose, David S. (Cleveland Museum of Natural History) SPECIAL-PURPOSE FORT ANCIENT
SITES IN SOUTHERN OHIO Excavations in the Caesar's Creek and Brush Creek drainage area,
while providing data on Fort Ancient economy, also demonstrate a technological and stylistic
transition from local late Woodland complexes to Fort Ancient, thereby supporting models which
derive Fort Ancient out of local antecedents. Other sites in the Caesar's Creek area date to a post-
A.D. 1400 period and are demonstrably contemporaneous with Madisonville phase sites to the
south. The Brush Creek excavations at the Killen-Grimes complex reveal evidence for a series of
special-purpose activity areas relating to the 400-meter distant Wamsley site. Activities repre-
sented include butchering, hide working, lithic reduction, pottery manufacture (7), and ceremonial
or mortuary treatment. These non-nucleated activities end at a low burial mound located on the
edge of the occupied terrace. The 33 burials from this mound lack evidence for high status treat-
ment. (40)
Brown, Joe, and David T. Clark (Smithsonian) A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE FAUNAL
ASSEMBLAGE FROM RUSSELL CAVE: 1956-1958 EXCAVATIONS Russel! Cave (1JA181) is a
deeply stratified, multicomponent site in Jackson County, northeast Alabama. The site was oc-
cupied, by human groups, for at least 9000 years. The faunal assemblage, currently under
analysis, was recovered during excavations conducted at the site between 1956 and 1958. Since
that time the assemblage has been housed at the Department of Anthropology, National Museum
of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution. The preliminary results of the faunal analysis have
syielded important information regarding the subsistence practices and modified bone tech-
nology employed by the inhabitants of the site. (55)

(Sonoma State-Rohnert Park) CULTURAL RESOURCES AND GEOTHERMAL DEVELOPMENT AT
THE GEYSERS, CALIFORNIA During the past six years, cultural resource management within the
Geysers Known Geothermal Resource Area in northern California had moved from a piecemeal
approach producing more than 100 cultural resource studies, to one coordinating the cultural

Bruhns, Karen O. (San Francisco State) CERAMICS, ETHNICITY AND TRADE; A DIACHRONIC
VIEW OF THE SOUTHERN FRONTIER Preliminary analyses of artifact assemblages from a
number of sites in El Salvador suggest very strongly a participation in several distinct spheres of
trade and influence during the prehispanic era. These diverse connections have at least twice led
to increased experimentation in ceramics and the spread of these new techniques to the north
and west. Although certain ethnic affiliations are hinted at, it is evident that we are dealing with a
situation of repeated movements of peoples and of changing trade routes due to political and
social events in both Mesoamerica and lower Central America Models developed in Western
Asia in similar situations may prove of value in dealing with these Salvadoran data. (59)

through which four different ethnic groups—Chipewyan, Cree, Metis, and EuroCanadian—resi-

oriented fur trade, and to other competing/cooperating social groups since the late 18th century
ig discussed. Information is drawn from several sources, including participant and ethno-
archeological observation conducted among ongoing communities and archaeological tield
survey of recently abandoned sites. A picture of the ecological process of intertribal and inter-
ethnic communication, symbiosis, enmity, and identity management is synthesized. Fur trade
specialization is seen as causally linked to these patterns of intergroup relationships. (61)

CHAEOLOGY Today's apparent pressing needs for new and better energy resources have created
situation which can be viewed as potentially dangerous for archaeology. With the emphasis on
oroviding new energy resources at a faster pace, archaeology cannot afford to be referred to as
the responsible agent in slowing projects. The adaptability of our profession to the needs of the
“real world” is of paramount importance. Two strategies, predictive planning and a specific
ethical code, are discussed as possible answers to integrating archeology with other national
concerns. (44)

was systemically related to the mining frontier. Initially, mining and related activities had
primacy over other uses of water, timber, energy and other resources and focus points for
development of Plains patterns. Mining dominance was superceded by maturity of regional pat-
terns related to national and other relationships. initial mining is relevant in understanding rela-

CERNING THE IMPACT OF BURNING UPON BONE Interpretation of cremated human bone fre-

degree to which bone shrinks and warps during incineration and expected pattern of surficial
| changes in bone burned ''‘green”’ and that burned dry. This paper presents new data derived from

SERVING INDUSTRY, CULTURAL RESOURCES AND THE PROFESSION Energy self-sufficiency
mas become a national priority and forthcoming energy development will be a major catalyst in
transforming the way we engage in contractual archaeological activities. Failure to ae
serve the eneray industry may result in the cultural resource laws being changed or overridden.
Problems that hinder such efficiency include: (1) time, (2) lack of qualified archaeologists; (3)
federal, state and Jocal bureaucratic ineptitude; (4) lack of field and report standards; (5) absence
ol adequate peer review, and (6) the “granting of clearance” by snenianiened archaeologists. A
solution to these problems focuses on the critical need for performance standards that can be
agreed upon and adhered to by all who are involved in such archeological undertakings. (44)

Catlin, Mark A. (Virginia) THE PRIMARY-SECONDARY SITE AGGREGATE AS AN ENVIRONMEN-

SUBSTANTIVE SIGNIFICANCE It has been argued that populations from the last phase of oc-
cupation, in Northeastern Black Mesa, established a specific kind of social organizational mech-
anism in order to adapt to the agricultural requirements of marginal upland areas. This mech-
anism was the establishment of primary-secondary site aggregates. The present study retests,
using statistical tests of significance, the original analysis. Also, settlement distributions from
earlier periods than the one that the original analysis considered are statistically analyzed. Final-
ly, an attempt is made to test an alterative hypothesis suggested for the social function of sites
with similar components to the primary site type. The implications of this hypothesis to the hy-
pothesized adaptive mechanism of the primary-secondary site aggregate are considered. (54)
Champion, Sara (Southampton) EXCHANGE AND RANKING: THE CASE OF CORAL The ap-

craft products emanating from specialized, patronized workshops, thus assisting in the recogni-
tion of both internal and external exchange patterns, The continued appearance of coral after the

Champion, Timothy C, (Southampton) FORTIFICATION, RANKING AND SUBSISTENCE The cor-
relation of social ranking with the construction of fortifications and variations in subsistence
strategy is considered, with special reference to Central Europe 1500-500 B.C. Evidence for rank-
ing is shown to vary through time, but to covary with pressure on subsistence resources. It is sug-
gested that subsistence demands were met variously by agricultural innovation and expansion,
both strategies demanded increased organizational control. Increased competition also led to
aggression, evidenced by fortification, new weapon types and greater ritual emphasis on
weapons. These manifestations of ranking show a remarkable similarity throughout Central
Europe. (12)
Chang, Claudia and Terry McCabe (SUNY-Binghamton) ETHNOGRAPHY FOR THE COMPLETE
: ARCHAEOLOGIST Much of the increased interest in ethnographic fieldwork for archaeologists
has arisen out of their growing concern in such areas as: (1) cultural ecology, (2) explanations of
behavioral systems, and (3) the role of experimentation in archaeology, This paper will explore
positively and pragmatically what ethnographic research has to offer archaeology with respect to
these areas of interest. We will also outline three areas that raise specific analytical problems in-
herent to crossing the disciplinary lines of ethnography and archaeology. These specific con-
cerns are: (1) scale and size of analytical units, (2) types ot data collecting methods, and (3) the
: use of data collected from informants. We also will examine how ethnography conducted by ar-
chaeologists contributes to the broader interests of social anthropologists, who usually seek ex-
planations of a less materialist nature. (61)

ogists is essential. Archaeologists, familiar with the appearance of redeposited or altered soils
containing cultural materials, require input from soil scientists to fully define the sequence of
natural and cultural processes which led site development. Such collaboration at Elizabeth

Chase. Arien F. (Pennsylvania) INTRUSIVE ELEMENTS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF NOHMUL
AND SANTA RITA Excavations at both Nohmul and Santa Ria have unearthed evidence for “in-
trusive influences” in northern Belize during the terminal Classic and Postclassic periods. These
imfluences are of a different nature and order of magnitude at each site for their respective time
periods, Both sites, however, exhibit ties to northern Yucatan. At Santa Rita, these links are quite
subtle while those at Nohmul are more pronounced. For Terminal Classic Nohmul, this northern
‘ink is felt to be a result of a direct Yucatec intrusion. The northern link to Late Postclassic Santa
Rita most likely results from the site's position as the regional capital of the area. (52)

NEVADA Gane Ow! House and Three Moon's Eagle represent two stratified, multicomponent, open
habitation sites located at the confluence of the Truckee River and Pyramid Lake, Washoe Coun-
Vv. Nevada. The present evidence indicates that the subsistence-settiement pattern practiced by
the inhabitants of the sites was based on the seasonal exploitation of the lowland biotic com-
munities of the Lower Truckee River/Pyramid Lake region. The subsistence pattern was based,
primarily, on the exploitation of fish from the ancient and unique fishery formed by the Truckee
River and Pyramid Lake. At these sites fishing was supplemented by plant collecting and the
hunting of small game. Each site functioned as a specialized food processing and manufacturing
locality, The research conducted at these sites represents the first detailed study of open habita-
tion sites in the lower Truckee River/Pyramid Lake region. (20)

process, and dependable results may require examination of thin sections by polarizing micro-
scopy, comparison with growth line records of local living populations, and random checks on
seasonal increments by oxygen isotope paleothermometry. Under ideal conditions, interpreta-
tions may include not only the season of harvest but the total size of the harvest and the number
of successive years in which harvests were made. (5)

Cleere, Henry F. (Council for British Archaeology) ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE PUBLIC IN BRITAIN
The tradition of amateur involvement in archaeology in Britain Is an old one. The history of the
relationship between the British people and the remains of their past is interpreted in terms of the
changing patterns of British society. Since World War I! attempts have been made to integrate
the various facets of antiquarianism and the conservation movement, but paradoxically the
greater availability of government funds has tended to increase polarization rather than integra-
tion. The present situation is an unstable one, resulting in an unfortunate dispersal of en-
*husiams and funds, and public interest in archaeology is thereby in danger of being eroded. (22)

whether or not Orange Walk could have been the historically known town of Holpatin. The results
ef the excavations done in 1978 are reported here. Although Postclassic material had been

tested within Orange Walk in the 17th century. Doubt is therefore cast on Holpatin being located
within the limits of present-day Orange Walk. (52)

archaeological data in the constricted Ohio Valley below the Falls reveal the following sequence:
Early and Middle Archaic—small sites on active riverside bars; Late Archaic—the same plus
large sites on floodplain ridges; Early Woodland—smail sites on floodplain ridges; Middie Wood-
tand and Mississippian—no habitation sites. The river reworked glacial outwash detritus and
deposited overlying finer sediments in bars until 1000 B.C, when a mature, forested, locally
swampy, clayey floodplain was established. lt is suggested that these conditions discouraged
settlement by agriculturalists until late nineteenth-century population pressure made clearing
and draining feasible.

THREE NINETEENTH CENTURY PHILADELPHIA NEIGHBORS Considerable archaeological

research in Philadelphia has centered upon seventeenth- and eighteenth-century occupations
45
, within the colonial boundaries of the city. Although later nineteenth-century occupations are
often in evidence, the full range of nineteenth century behavior has not been adequately ad-
dressed by the analyses of third and fourth generation occupational debris in colonial parts of the
city. This paper attempts to partially resolve this problem by presenting a comparative analysis of
privy fills from two contemporaneous neighborhoods dating to ca. 1810-1830 and intrusive early
nineteenth century privy fills from a neighborhood initially developed in the early eighteenth cen-
tury. Among the factors to be addressed are observable differences in lifestyle and ditferences in
sanitation practices and attitudes. (49)
Coughlin, E. A. and Ericson, J. E. (Harvard) BOGEOCHEMICAL RESIDUES AS ETHNOBOTANI-

the soil, It does appear that certain plants accumulate or are deficient in particular suites of
elements. This biogeochemical partitioning of elements provides a means of identifying the
residues of particular plants or plant categories. A survey technique is proposed which efficiently
identifies these residues as anomalies in the soll of the site. This biogeochemical patterning
and technique can be applied in site surveying, locating specific activity areas on-site and detect-
ing reasons for dietary and nutritional pathologies in the skeletal remains of the inhabitants. (38)
Crabtree, Pam Jean (Pennsylvania) ANIMAL USE AND CULTURAL CHANGE West Stew, the only
completely excavated Anglo-Saxon site in Britain, is a rural settlement site dating from the 5th to
7th centuries A.D. Four Anglo-Saxon occupation phases can be discerned. Excavations produced
a vast quantity of animal bone remains. The abundance and excellent state of preservation of
these bones make meaningful quantitative faunal analysis possible. Traditional analyses of ar-
chaeological animal bone assemblages have emphasized the reconstruction of prehistoric
economic and subsistence systems. In contrast, the analysis of the West Stew faunal material
was designed to detect both conventional economic information and noneconomic cultural infor-
mation which may also be obtained through faunal analysis. (55)
Creamer, Winifred (Tulane) EVIDENCE FOR PREHISPANIC EXCHANGE SYSTEMS IN THE GULF
OF NICOYA, COSTA RICA Sixteenth-century explorers of the Pacific coast stopped in the Gulf of
Nicoya, landing at several islands reporting water travel and trade. The hypothesis that the
islands were exchange centers is examined. Archaeological survey of seven islands indicates
that there was extensive prehispanic occupation of the region, while ceramics collected show in-
crease in variability of types from the Middle (A.D. 500-1200) to the Late Polychrome (A.D.
1200-1500) period. This suggests that contacts with areas outside the Nicoya region were in-
creasing, Impetus for exchange may have been population pressure or lack of durable resources:
exchange in turn may have stimulated changes in social organization. (2)

edaphic factors are similar in both areas. Specific environments do differ between areas with
Biue Ridge environmental resources tightly packed in small units and Great Valley resources in
large units less tightly packed. Consequently, Blue Ridge settlement patterns indicate more
seasonal fragmentation and with Woodland population growth new communities appear. Great
Valley settlement patterns differ with fewer Indications of seasonal fragmentation during the Ar-
ehaic and increased size of individual sites with Woodland population growth. (33)
Daddario, Joanne T. (Arizona State) AN EXCHANGE AND INTERACTION NETWORK ON THE
COLORADO PLATEAU Recent excavations conducted at the site of Chavez Pass, Arizona, have
indicated the presence of large quantities of trade items from a wide geographical area. Such
nonlocal materials (e.g., ceramics, turquoise and shell) occur throughout the archaeological se-
quence at the site. The relative frequencies of exotic items imported from distinct geographical
areas varies through time, indicating possible changes in the organization of the interaction net-
work. This paper attempts to identify these changes and to outline a diachronic model of ex-
change. (54)

with a large shell concentration; and a late prehistoric occupation which is possibly proto-
Tiinget. (24)
Day, Jane (Boulder) USING A PRIVATE COLLECTION OF CERAMICS FOR RESEARCH IN COSTA
RICAN PREHISTORY Scientific excavation in the Guanacaste region of Costa Rica had produced a
basic chronology associated with thousands of sherds but has turned up only a limited number of
provenienced whole vessels. One unique private collection in this area, while lacking original
context, had been fully preserved by the owner. Several thousand vessels, both decorated and
47
, utilitarian, represent 2000 years of ceramic technology; it is important to attempt to incorporate
these vessels and the information they can give us into the known scientific framework of the
region. (2)

De Atley, Suzanne (Smithsonian) MEASURING STANDARDIZATION IN CERAMIC PRODUC.
TION IN THE PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST Extensive application of various types of material
analysis have demonstrated the presence of marked variability in the selection and use of
ceramic resources in the American Southwest. However, the role of productive strategies in ex-
plaining this variability is rarely systematically explored. The purpose of the research reported
here is to characterize patterns of material variation exhibited in ceramics from sites where pro-
duction patterns have been hypothesized to be quite distinct (i.e., household production vs. part-
time specialization). An assessment of the heterogeneity or homogeneity of resource use at
these sites provides a means to infer the degree of standardization involved for the different
modes of production. The results of a series of analyses by neutron activation, petrography, and
microprobe are presented and discussed, (54)

De Barros, Philip L. (UCLA) THE EFFECTS OF SITE DURATION VARIABILITY UPON THE
RESULTS OF FREQUENCY SERIATION. It is argued that the nature of the effects of variable oc-
Cupation span upon frequency seriation has not yet been clearly elucidated. Such clarification is
provided by graphic models used to generate simulated data that is then seriated. The assump-
tions underlying such a procedure are thoroughly analyzed. Possible solutions to the problem of
site duration variability are discussed, including those proposed by previous authors. It is con-
cluded that the problem cannot be easily resolved, but only limited in its effects. It is argued that
site duration variability, like sampling error and spatial variability, will always limit the precision
of seriation. (35)

Del Bene, Terry A. and Gerald A, Holly (Connecticut) THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF USE-
WEAR ANALYSIS In their search for methods to determine the manners in which prehistoric lithic
implements were manufactured and utilized investigators have turned to microscopic use-wear
analysis. More concern has been expressed about the correlations of microscopic attributes with
specific functions than how these patterns might be interpreted on a regional basis. This paper
suggests that emphasis might best be directed towards the determination of site function rather
than specific implement function. The site function is based more on the sum of the observed
wear patterns and therefore might be more relevant to intersite comparison. (37)

Demarest, Arthur A. (Harvard) THE DATING AND CULTURAL ASSOCIATIONS OF THE “POT.

of a controversy in Mesoamerican archaeology. These massive boulder sculptures have been
found at numerous sites associated with the major culture-historical problems of the Preclassic
period. Nonetheless, secure dating of the style has not been possible and they have been sub-
jected to conflicting interpretations. This paper describes new evidence from the site of Santa
Leticia, El Salvador, which securely dates several “pot-bellied” monuments, associating them
with a pristine Late Preciassic village. Based on these discoveries, an interpretation of the nature
and significance of this culture complex is undertaken. (39)

Late Preclassic ceramics of El Salvador is a prerequisite for the solution of several major prob-
lems concerning the rise of Maya civilization. Excavations at Santa Leticia, a Late Preclassic
village in western El Salvador, recovered a large ceramic assemblage from undisturbed trash pits.
The Santa Leticia’ ceramics were analyzed using several contrasting classificatory schemes. This
paper discusses the results of these analyses and their implications for both longstanding cul-
ture-historical problems and the current methodological debate over alternative approaches to
ceramic classification. (59)

Dickson, D. Bruce (Texas A&M) THE YANOMAMO OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY? SOME
REFLECTIONS ON LARSON (1972), GIBSON (1974), AND MISSISSIPPIAN PERIOD WARFARE IN
THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES Larson's (1972) hypothesis that warfare during the
Mississippian period in the Southeast was primarily a struggle over the fertile silt and sandy loam
bottomland soils is summarized. This explanation is contrasted with Gibson's (1974) thesis that,
at least in the Lower Mississippi Valley, warfare was caused by the “asymmetrical” nature of the
kinship systems found there. The Larson-Gibson dispute is characterized essentially as an on-
tological argument that pits the materialist’s view of reality against that of the idealist. This
dispute is compared to a similar one between Harris (1974, 1975, 1979) and Lizot (1977) concern-
ing the explanation of Yanomamo warfare in South America. The basic material conditions of
Mississippian warfare are suggested. The importance of mechanisms such as Gibson proposes
im understanding Mississippian warfare at the “tactical” level is recognized, but primacy is given
to Larson's materialism at the “strategic” level, (33)

A.D. 400, 1150 and 1700; minimum values, at A.D. 200, 750 and 1500. Specimens came from

Early, Ann M. (Arkansas Arch, Survey) CADDOAN SETTLEMENT SYSTEMS IN THE OUACHITA
RIVER VALLEY Caddoan culture, a regional variant of Mississippian culture, encompasses
several locally distinct, prehistoric horicultural societies. Local physiography and culture history
contribute to shaping the nature of these subregional units. The Ouachita valley encompasses
two distinct physiographic zones in close proximity to each other, The pattern of Caddoan settle-
ment derived trom data gathered in the last decade indicates that Caddoan settlement patterns
differ significantly between the two areas. By applying newly formulated models of Mississippian
subsistence and social organization to these data, hypotheses concerning economic base and
populations size hierarchies are generated. (42)

Ebright, C. A. (SUNY-Binghamton) PREHISTORIC QUARTZITE UTILIZATION IN SOUTHEASTERN
PENNSYLVANIA Quartzite constitutes a major lithic resource extensively utilized in the North-
east during the Archaic and Transitional periods. In southeastern Pennsylvania, quartzite is one
of several non-chert lithic materials in use, and the Hardyston Formation of Cambrian age forms
the primary source. Hardyston quartzite is a sedimentary quartzite which was quarried directly
from bedrock deposits. The Robesonia Quartzite Quarry is an undisturbed quarry site in the Har-
dyston Formation which serves as a basis for analysis. Two major problems are the need to deal
effectively with massive amounts of archaeological materials related to a biface reduction in-
dustry, and the need to separate these materials and features from the natural products of geo-
légical processes operating on the site. (43)
Eckles, David G. (State of Wyoming) ABANDONMENT OF NORTHEASTERN BLACK MESA,
ARIZONA—THE TEMPERATURE CONNECTION Environmental change has often been posited
#s 4 primary cause of prehistoric culture change in the American Southwest. Usually, culture
changes have been correlated with changes from more mesic environmental conditions to more
drought-like conditions. An overlooked aspect of environmental change is change in the length of
the growing season. Such changes in growing season length affect all agricultural peoples; this
effect becomes all the more critical the higher in elevation crops are grown. On Northeastern
Black Mesa, Arizona, where elevations range from 6000 to 8000 feet, such a problem may have af-
fected Anasazi agricultural efforts. This paper examines the hypothesis that change in growing
season length, and not drought, was the major environmental stress affecting agricultural efforts
on Black Mesa. (54)

amswer this question it is necessary to know whether the seplecoabhetie directions form
statistically discrete clusters. Current statistics to do this test assume specimen directions are
peormally distributed and the samples have equal variances. Because serious questions of nor-

ment for the sociopolitical structure of neolithic societies are presented. The first considers that
large reference groups with well-developed structures were important from the outset, and sees
later development in terms of further internal development and/or amalgamation between these
large units. The second takes the view that much smaller groups were present at the beginning,
and that their later consolidation was a piecemeal process. On Dartmoor, an upland area in
southwest England, the existence of second millennium B,C. land boundaries and contemporary
settlements allows the examination of a comparison of these two models, with reference to con-
formity behavior, centrallzation/localization tendencies, and different levels of socipolitical inte-
gration. (12)
Fleming, Stuart and Nicholas Hartmann (University Museum-Pennsylvania) SCIENTIFIC DATING
TECHNIQUES: THEIR POTENTIAL IN THE COROZAL POSTCLASSIC PROJECT The richness of
artifacts in Postclassic occupation contexts offers a broad platform for technical study of this
important Maya period, particularly in chronology-building. Thermoluminescence dating of pot-
tery, radiocarbon analysis of organic remains, amino-acid recemization properties of skeletal
material, and the hydration rim analysis of obsidian are all potentially applicable. This paper will
review the physical principles, relative accuracy and limitations of these methods, drawing ii-
justrations from the 1979 excavation at Santa Rita (Belize). (52)

effort to isolate distinguishing features between central and non-central zones. Some tentative
explanations of the data will be considered. (56)

AND ACCULTURATION ON THE NORTHWEST PERIPHERY OF MESOAMERICA Settled village
life apparently was established along the eastern foothills of the Sierra Madre Occidental in
northern Mexico weil betore A.D. 1. The best known of the area's many cultures is the Loma San
Gabriel, a sub-Mesoamerican culture in that it has basic Mesoamerican elements such as
elementary agriculture, simple ceramics, primitive architecture, hamlet life, and a dispersed
inter- and intra-site settlement patterns. Beginning about A.D. 300, the area comes under strong
Mesoamerican influence and occupation in the form of the Chalchihuites culture. Although
strongly influenced, Loma San Gabriel appears to maintain its cultural identity. This paper
analyzes the forms of influence and their ultimate effect on Loma San Gabriel's cultural Survival.

SWAMP (BAJO) AND ADJACENT SETTLEMENT AREAS Excavations in raised fields in the
Orange Walk district in northern Belize have produced significantly larger collections of ceramics
than previous projects. The ceramic data indicate that not all fields in the Pulltrouser Swamp
complex were constructed simultaneously. Preliminary analysis suggests a Late Preclassic
dating for the earliest raised fields, Other fields date from the Early Classic, while still others are
of Late Classic date. Ceramic dates are compared with Carbon-14 dates for the same features.
Excavations in structures immediately adjacent to the field system indicates a parallel occupa-
tion. Analysis indicates widespread sources of ceramics for this area far from a major ceremonial
center. (8)

significance when viewed in terms of social and institutional organization as one progresses
from Theocratic to Militaristic times. In some cases, morphological changes cannot be cor-
related with traditionally accepted phase designations. The utility of graph theory as a
methodological tool is evaluated and recommended, (34)

tial on the Continental Shelf. This evaluation, in addition to recently acquired data, proves the
basis for a method and theory for the study of offshore terrestrial archaeological sites. Models of
settlement and environmental utilization developed from the prehistoric archaeological record in
active onshore coastal systems provide the basis for identifying high probability areas for sites In
relict offshore systems. Side-scan sonar, sub-bottom profilers, and magnetometers have been
employed to identify areas of high site probability. Core and grab samples, underwater television,

New Jersey, has provided data needed to complete a comparative study of a large site without ex-
cavation and with minimal site disturbance. Using this methodology It was possible to identify
most of the features and determine chronology; intrasite status differences were also in-

research on the lithic technology of the Formative Period in Peru is presented to demonstrate
how attributes of highly variant flake tools can be systematized to reflect temporal and functional

time within a repetitive functional context, in contrast to a set of “functional” attributes which
are seen to vary between different economic contexts at a fixed point in time. (37)
Gibbon, Guy E. (Minnesota) POSITIVISM AND THE NEW ARCHAEOLOGY New archaeologists
began to adopt “positivism” as a methodological doctrine and as a descriptive account of em-
pirical science at the same time as an antipositive tendency began to dominate contemporary
philosophy of natural and social science. Several of the criticized doctrines of strict positivism
are reviewed. It is concluded that positivism as a philosophy of science has many laudable goals
when only vaguely defined as is common in archaeology; when more strictly defined, however,
positivism has been shown to be an unnecessarily restrictive methodological doctrine and a too
narrow descriptive account of empirical science. The implications of these conclusions for
research within archaeology are discussed. (16)

Gliman, Antonio (CSU-Northridge) THE ORIGINS OF SOCIAL STRATIFICATION IN LATER
PREHISTORIC EUROPE The emergence of a hereditary elite class in Bronze Age Europe is now
widely interpreted in terms of the redistributive activities of a managerial class. This functionalist
account of elite origins goes against a uniformitarian understanding of what ruling classes do In
complex societies. The rise of hereditary, superordinate social strata In prehistoric Europe is bet-
ter understood as a consequence of social conflicts attendant upon the development of capital-
intensive subsistence techniques. The observations that capital-intensification preceded elite
emergence and that areas with greater intensification exhibited greater social inequalities con-
aa a non-functionalist account of the development of stratification in later prehistoric Europe.

Analysis of differential distribution of mortuary artifacts from Middle Woodland Period Copena
mounds in Northern Alabama suggests structural similarities and differences. The occurrence of
certain classes of artifacts, symbolic of high status positions, |s limited to a restricted number of
individuals. The interment of these individuals at large, multimound sites, and the observed dif-
ferences between these classes of individuals in terms of skeletal orientation and mortuary treat-
ment, suggests a ranked society. This coupled with a detailed analysis of exotic mortuary
material source areas and hierarchical settlement structure indicates that these Individuals
played an important role in Copena Interregional exchange and perhaps in the socio-political
organization of the group. (63)

OF THE CRAWFISH VALLEY IN SOUTHEASTERN WISCONSIN Aztalan is the most famous site

theories abounded, little attempt was made to view the site ina regional perspective. Until recent-
ly, NO representative survey of the Surrounding area existed. Results of a long-term survey begun
In 1976 indicate the area's unique environmental zonesjare a key to prehistoric site location. Prior
to Mississippian, the proposed model suggests repeated occupation through time, rather than
continuous occupation at one time. Aztalan is seen as reflecting a shift in both subsistence and
settlement pattern. (23)

STORAGE: THE USDA FOREST SERVICE SYSTEM The U.S. Forest Service has management
responsibility for approximately 187 million acres of land. Current estimates indicate that bet-

Rather than attempt to build a single master data file for all sites and site information, the Forest
Service has adopted a regional approach which decentralizes the data and makes it avaliable
through several data banks, each specific to a region. The advantages and disadvantages of the
decentralized system are explored. (6)

cesses evident there. Although the area shows a clear cultural orientation to Valley of Mexico
cultures during the Late Formative period, the Classic phases witness the development of a local
character with few ties to Teotihuacan. The apogee of the Valley, occurring during the Epiclassic
period, is best exemplified by the extensive and powerful occupation of Xochicaico. The Early

59
, Postclassic represents a period of cultural impoverishment and possibly marks the beginning of
Tlahuica occupation. (34)

Quality Act, many easements have been donated in California. Easement programs operated by
organizations concerned with preserving historic buildings, open-space, natural areas, and

some 965 reef fishes, sharks, stingrays, crabs, and sea turtles. These animals ranked first in the
prehistoric economy, surpassing even mammals in numerical importance. Although marine

This pilot settlement study reports the results of mapping of a small, well-defined site, in direct
association with raised fields in the bajo complex called Pulltrouser Swamp, in gorthern Belize.
The significance of the site location and details of site form are examined, This small community
has been named Kokea/, To the south lies a separate enclave, which is possibly restricted to Late
Preciassic occupation. Although beyond the objectives of the pilot program some preliminary
Gata are presented on the site distribution around the bajo complex as a whole. (8)

MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS OF OBSIDIAN FROM SANTA RITA Occupational debris from
Postclassic contexts within the site of Santa Rita in northern Belize includes a group of obsidian
blades and biadelets. Examination of the working edges of these tools, using both low-power op-
tical microscopy and an SEM, reveals coherent patterns of striation and of micro-chipping.
Analysis of these patterns clarifies the place of this group of tools in the general lithic tool-kit of
61
, the site: further experiments will provide more specific information on the materials that were be-
ing worked. (52)

studies involve the postulation of major sea level stillstands during the Pleistocene and the
development of areas of probable species habitat, based on an analysis of relevant paleoen-
vironmental studies. Using this information, along with a review of archaeological research,
delineation of a regional cultural chronology and reconstruction of hunter-gatherer subsistence
economies, areas on the OCS are tanked as regions of high, medium, and low probability of ar-
chaeologic site occurrence and preservation. (10)
Healy, Paul F. and Heather McKillop (Trent) MOHO CAY, BELIZE: ANCIENT MAYAN MARITIME
ADAPTATIONS Results are presented from preliminary excavations to investigate settlement,
trade, and marine resource procurement at Moho Cay, a small island located In the mouth of the
Belize River. From ceramic evidence, the site dates to the Classic Period, between 400-800 A.D.,
with some Late Preclassic and Late Postclassic material. Marine resources are evidenced by a
midden of manatee (sea cow) bones associated with broken flint tools, by fish vertebrae, over 20
different species of mollusk and thousands of ceramic “netsinkers.” The possibilities for involve
ment of Moho Cay as a transshipment center in long-distance and regional sea/riverine trade are

Helgren, David M. (UC-Davis) LOCATING HUNTER-GATHERER ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES: A
SPATIAL AND PALEOENVIRONMENTAL PARADIGM A spatial-paleoenvironmental method of
site survey is presented as an alternative to traditional site survey procedures. Spatial-
environmental site survey is based on the patterning of sites, geomorphic elements, and ultimate-
ly, resources. The selection of site locations represents the application of systematic, locative
criteria by the society under study. These criteria are discoverable; the landscapes of
topographic elements and potential resource locations are reconstructable; and both can be
predicted and tested. Methods to operationalize this survey strategy, which include paleoland-
scape mapping and applied locational analysis, are described. (35)
Henderson, T. Kathleen (Arizona State) SOCIAL INTERACTION AND ORGANIZATIONAL
CHANGE: A DIACHRONIC PERSPECTIVE One phenomenon commonly observed during the

signaled major changes in the organizational structure ot Plateau societies, specifically the
62

changes are expected in the nature and degree of social exchange and interaction. This expecta-
‘lon arises from the decision-maker's role In collecting and disseminating information and coor-

5!1DE OF ALEXANDRIA: ARCHAEOLOGY IN AN ENDURING BLACK NEIGHBORHOOD Within the
city of Alexandria, Virginia, today are a number of relatively homogeneous black neighborhoods
that have considerable historic depth. One of these neighborhoods, known locally as “The Dip,”’
began as a smal! aggregation of freed slaves at the beginning of the nineteenth century. The
focus of the archaeological investigations in the Dip has been to trace the development of black
neighborhoods in Alexandria to assess the changing economic and social position of such
groups in relation to the dominant historic white community. The Dip project represents the
preliminary stage of an in-depth study of Afro-American neighborhoods in Alexandria. (57)
Henry, Donald O. (Tulsa) PALEOLITHIC INVESTIGATION IN SOUTHERN JORDAN The paper sum-

Naqb, southern Jordan. The investigation resulted in the discovery of 60 sites representing Mid-
die Paleolithic, Upper Paleolithic, Epipaleolithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic periods. A number of
sites contained stratified, multicomponent occupations in association with well-preserved faunal
remains and datable materials. A summary of the cultural and environmental successions for the
region is presented and compared to parallel sequences for other regions of the greater Levant.
The research was made possible by a grant (BNS-79-06281) from the National Science Founda-

Henry, Susan L. (Alexandria Regional Preservation Office) AN INTEGRATIVE SURVEY STRATEGY
FOR RESEARCH AND PRESERVATION in the absence of a previously formulated research
design for an urban archaeological survey, the Alexandria Regional Preservation Office worked
through several approaches and formulated a survey strategy based on (1) geomorphological
strata, (2) waterways, (3) transportation arteries, (4) impact areas, and (5) ethnohistoric documen-
tation. Survey of selected strata results in data on prehistoric and historic site location and con-
tent. Ethnohistoric data yields information on population densities and permits the identification
of ethnic neighborhoods and occupational clusters. These data are used to address research
questions in addition to providing the basis on which the city's preservation plan Is structured.

RECONSIDERATION OF THE CRITICISM Recent criticism argues that “young kill" age profiles
may not be taken as reliable evidence for herding or domestication thus challenging the traditional
picture of southwestern Asian neolithic cultural development. The criticism, which involves
evaluation of the age distributions of living ungulate populations and the mortality patterns
created by hurnan and non-human predators, concludes that “young kill" could as well be .
evidence for a strategy of selective hunting. In this paper it is argued that this criticism misuses
biological data in the construction of archaeological expectations. The controversy is considered
in terms of Zagros late Pleistocene and early Holocene faunal samples. (55)

Hodder, lan (Cambridge) TYPOLOGY AND EXCHANGE DISTRIBUTIONS Work on the long-

fall-off curves can usefully be examined. The first part of the paper demonstrates that different
field recovery techniques can change not only the quantity of dots on maps, but also relative pro-
portions and the typology of the artifacts exchanged. With this proviso, the second part of the
paper examines typological variation of English Neolithic axes with distance from the source.
The typological variation is used in testing competing hypotheses about exchange mechanisms.

The emergence of the Arkansas Archaeological Survey has diminished the importance of the

distributions which allow cross-reference to firsthand accounts, we may be better equipped to
observe, interpret, and explain patterning of prehistoric remains. Hypotheses concerning ar-
chaeological remains resulting from Known activities, individuals, periods and reasons can be
tested. Monitoring of transformational processes on selected sheepherder sites should provide
useful information about these processes. Such data will also aid our Interpretations of
prehistoric remains. (4)

Holley, Gerald A. (Washington) ARCHAEOLOGICAL TAPHONOMY A major aspect In assessing
64
, the potential quality of data produced from archaeological manifestations is the evaluation of the
interaction between culturally deposited materials and environmental variables. In order to
assess the power of archaeological units to provide sufficient data to address problems, it is
necessary to recognize the formation processes of the archaeological context (archaeological
taphonomy). This assessment has for the most part been post hoc, resulting in ambiguous con-
tributions to our knowledge. It is argued here that archaeological taphonomy must be incor-
porated into the formative stages of a research design to ensure the generation of sufficient data
and to avoid ambiguous analytical conclusions. (5)
Holliday, Vance T. (Colorado) SOME APPLICATIONS OF PEDOLOGY TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RESEARCH A soil in the pedologic sense forms under the influence of parent material,
topography, organisms, time, and climate, The factors of time and climate can be used to date
deposits and yield paleoclimatic information. indicators of the age of a soil include: color of the B
horizon; clay mineral alteration and formation; amount of clay translocation; CaCO, movement
and accumulation; and transformation of certain forms of phosphorous. The influence of climate
can be inferred by: amount of organic carbon in the A horizon clay mineral formation and rates of
formation; and CaCOg rates of accumulation, amounts, and position in the profile. In order to
isolate the factors of time and ciimate the influence of the other factors must be known.
Pedologic information integrated with other kinds of data from an archaeological project has the
potential for making a considerable contribution to the reconstruction of site history, (5)

Data from excavations at Tal-e Malyan and Darvazeh Tepe, as well as from systematic surface

military upheavals in Mesopotamia and the iranian lowlands around 1600 B.C. These upheavals
destroyed long-established trade and diplomatic ties between the lowlands and highlands and
isolated the highland communities, which consequently became self-sufficient and ingrown. (7)

VIEW FROM BLUESTONE LAKE, WEST VIRGINA Excavations and attendant analyses at three
single-component, open sites at Bluestone Lake in Summers County, West Virginia indicate the
presence of populations exhibiting both marked Feurt Phase Fort Ancient affinities as well as af-
finities to local Appalachian complexes. Specifically, excavations at 46SU3, 46SU9 and 46SU22
have produced extensive ceramic and lithic assemblages ascribable to the thirteenth century
A.D. which reflect both the presence of Feurt Phase Fort Ancient groups as well as indigenous
non-Feurt populations. Data suggest that a new Fort Ancient phase representing an amalgama-
tion of Feurt and indigenous Appalachian groups should be defined for this area. This proposed
phase is suggested as the probable source for Fort Ancient-derived traits on the upper New River
in Virginia. (40)

The analysis of soils and sediments has been a neglected aspect of research in North American
historical archaeology. The main use for sol! analysis in historical archaeology lies in its poten-
tial for yielding data about the spatial organization of past human societies. Such aves takes
place at three different levels: a macro level of site location and regional settiement patterning,
an intermediate level of intrasite activity area mapping, and a micro level of specific feature func-
tional identification. At each of these levels, it is important to gear the analytical techniques used

ther argue that “cultural resource management,” rather than being the “new" new archaeology,
has greatly hindered the contributions of archaeology to the field of anthropology as a whole. We

prehistory is presented instead, emphasizing the development of food production in an American
mode based on management of indigenous resources supplemented by imported cultigens; only
in the boreal forest and eastern Arctic were there true hunter-gatherers by the late Holocene (last
two millennia). Most American societies were stratified by the Protohistoric era (last prehistoric

Kennedy, Nedenia C. (Western Michigan) OPENING THE FRONTIER AT PLAYA DE LOS MUER-
TOS The isolation and definition of three ceramic complexes suggest that the site of Playa de los
Muertos in Honduras was occupied continuously from approximately 900 B.C. to 300 B.C, Follow-
ing a review of this tradition and the comparative evidence, it Is argued that Formative occupa-
tions in western Honduras (and the Southeastern Frontier) were neither as retarded nor as
peripheral as has often been implied in the literature. in conclusion, the origins of Mesoamerican
civilization are reappraised with reference to this position, and to a general model of cultural
development in the New World tropics. (39)

: Americans has demonstrated that the assumptions archaeologists commonly employ concern-
ing activity area usage best fit the spatial patterning of their own culture. Activity areas are not
universally sex specific or monofunctional. in an attempt to go beyond mere description, and to
understand activity area usage, a structural model was formulated. The model, which still is
preliminary, allows an archaeologist to extrapolate different kinds of information hitherto unat-
tainable, Archaeologists need not be limited to describing cultural material and behavior, but can
investigate such abstract cultural phenomena as sex roles, individualism, specialization, and
culture change. (61)
Kerrigan, James F. (Pennsylvania) A STUDY OF THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD Analyses of
prehistoric settlement patterns rely on accurate reconstruction of criteria by which prehistoric
people organized their use of a region. To overcome the fact that the primary source of evidence
for prehistoric settlement patterns (i.e. the archaeological record) is incomplete, a method is pro-
posed that indicates those criteria and the degree of incompleteness of the archaeological
record. The method uses linear programming and post-optimal variations to achieve results and
has been applied to the 9th-4th millennia B.P. prehistory of Northern Ireland. (16)
King, Thomas F. (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation) RESOURCE PROTECTION AND THE
STATE PLAN: A PROGRAMMATIC RELATIONSHIP Increasing sophistication of federal agencies
and State Historic Preservation Officers makes it possible for the Advisory Council on Historic |
Preservation to substitute “programmatic” protection of historic properties, including archaeo-
‘ogical sites, for case-by-case compliance with the historic preservation authorities. The poten-
tial exists for such arrangements to be linked to State Historic Preservation Plans, which could
give each state an integrated, coordinated, archaeological research and preservation program.
State plans are not yet sophisticated enough to allow such linkage, but directions for develop-
ment can be recognized and followed. (9)
King, Thomas J., Jr. (Land and Water Resources Service) THE ROLES OF THE AGENCY ARCHAE-

ogist in federal contract archaeology are discussed. It is pointed out that a disparity of percep-
tion of these roles exists, with the contract archaeologist often seeing only a portion of the roles
performed by the agency archaeologist. Some of these roles include archetypes such as the con-
tract monitor, the “wailing wail,” the “golden goose," the research evaluator, and the manage-
ment analyst. It ls argued that development of a consensus formative view of such roles Is essen-
tial due to the massive impact on the discipline of large mitigation programs, programs which are
often managed to some degree by agency archaeologists. Suggestions for achieving such a con-
sensus are offered. (62)

from a systematic archival and archaeological survey, the plan integrates ideal research and
preservation needs with real-world situations. The plan isa reference document on how archaeo-

Several causal factors, both internal and external, have been presented in the literature, This
paper reexamines the systemic interrelationships among these causal factors in terms of catas-

for the analysis of surface collection data, including filtering and trend-surface analysis, are @x-

activities among tourists visiting Washington, D.C., as well as among members of the Armed Ser-

determination, computerized systems will assume an increased role. Within this framework of
concerns, current archaeological computerized data management in the Midwest is discussed.

pilot study exploring the possibility of discriminating between different volcanic materials on the
basis of their trace elernent compositions. These materials present many problems for trace ele-
ment analysis, but preliminary results are promising. It is especially desirable to make such
discriminations because the very close spacings of sources in eastern Massachusetts may allow
the determination of characteristics of prehistoric territories. (43)

Marshall, Sydne B. (Columbia) DESCRIPTIVE ARTIFACT CATEGORIES AND IMPLIED FUNC-
TION: A PROBLEM IN ARCHAEOLCGICAL SEMANTICS Categories used to describe artifact
form often have connotations of functional association. Such Implications appear to facilitate
transition from description of form to interpretation of function. Wear pattern analysis of the
Shawnee-Minisink Paleoindian assemblage shows that the range of tool function must be
demonstrated by analysis rather than implied by choice of category label. The morphological
variability of the Shawnee-Minisink Paleoindian assemblage exceeds that of exhibited functional
variability, suggesting that original typological goals that resulted in organizing data into
descriptive types must be foremost when proceeding to the next interpretive level of artifact and
assemblage function. (47)

new data suggest that while Woodland settlement and subsistence patterns were significantly
different than the preceding Archaic patterns, a major shift In focus to coastal resources in the
Woodland period did not necessarily occur in southern New England. Rather, an orientation
towards large settlements within a more restricted settlement pattern seems to have occurred in
the Woodland period. (29)

at southern Somerset Isiand, N.W.T., suggest consistency in (1) using Ba/aena mysticetus in
prehistoric times, (2) selecting small (6-8 m) whales from the Davis Strait stock, (3) constructing
winter houses of similar size which reflects whale mandible size, (4) modifying crania with a hole
through which brains were probably extracted, and (5) symmetrically using right and left bones

analysis of the modern and prehistoric ecological conditions of the region has been initiated.
Present research Includes a description of modern vegetation, which has been substantially
modified by large-scale hydraulic works and intensive urbanization during the past four decades.
it is argued that prehispanic ecological conditions can only be understood on the basis of ar-
chaeological botanical remains—mainly seeds and pollen—recovered from several stratigraphic
excavations carried out recently in the area. The long-range goal of this project is the recon-

similar valleys within the study area display environmental differences marked enough to have af-
fected the spread of the Neolithic. Indeed the archaeological record shows that farming groups
settied in the richest valleys in the area as early as the eighth millennium, while similar groups
appeared in nearby, less favored valleys only in the fifth millennium B.C. (30)

CHAEOMAGNETIC INFORMATION BETWEEN THE ARCHAEOLOGIST AND GEOPHYSICIST
Most archaeologists are not aware of why geophysicists are interested in archaeomagnetism or
what data should be exchanged between them. To construct a paleomagnetic secular variation
curve, the geophysicist needs to know the site location, general condition of the archaeomag-
netic feature, and peculiarities of the individual samples, and most critically, any and all chrono-
togical information pertaining to the firing of the feature. In order to properly evaluate and publish
archaeomagnetic results, the archaeologist should receive in return the paleomagnetic direction
recorded by the feature, the uncertainty to this direction, and the source of the master curves and
the procedures used to infer archaeomagnetic dates. (11)

one data analysis identified five strata. Stage two concentrated upon strata with greatest varia-
ton in site types and frequencies. Sample units (200 m x 100 m) served as both Investigation and
analysis units. Therefore, simple random sampling can be assumed when deriving site popula-

McMillan, Barbara A. (Dartmouth) THE ISOLATION OF LIVING FLOORS FROM COMPACT
STRATIGRAPHY The Early Archaic zone at the Shawnee-Minisink site is used to develop 4
theoretical and methodological framework for the isolation of occupations embedded in compact
stratigraphy. The basic assumption is that reoccupations of a site through time will overlap
spatially but not occur in exactly the same positions due to differential criteria of site selection
and site abandonment. Methods used include distributions of raw material categories, matching
fragments, and projectile point types (in that order). Six living floors are defined, although more
knowledge of geological and cultural processes that affect artifact placement Is needed. (47)

over 55,000 artifacts. Based on these data, a chronological sequence was developed covering the
11,000 years of site occupation beginning with Paleoindian and terminating with a A.D. 1500 Late
Woodland longhouse. Particularly important is the possible delineation of a hitherto unknown oc-
cupation overlying the Paleoindian stratum and characterized by a single collaterally flaked, cor-

tlonal requirements, raw material) control that variability. An example using endscrapers is given.
The factors are defined, a set of variables describing the tools is created, and the stylistic and
functional components are determined. Though endscrapers are commonly seen as having at-
tributes of both style and function, this analysis shows there is no stylistic component. (37)

Miller, Arlene V, (Chicago) PHYTOLITHS AS INDICATORS OF FARMING TECHNIQUES The silica
content of domestic grasses may distinguish irrigated plants from those that were dry farmed.
Phytolith analyses from archaeological sites in Egypt and Central America have produced silica
casts of multiple articulated epidermal cells which differ from the more common single celled
phytoliths. Plants grown in these regions may have had a greater silica intake than plants that
yield single celled phytoliths. A possible explanation is that a warm climate combined with
standing water in an Irrigated field stimulates chemical processes that free silica from the soll.
Thus excess silica is absorbed by the plant. (3)
Miller, Arthur G. (University Museum—Pennsylvania) ART HISTORICAL IMPLICATIONS OF
QUIRIGUA SCULPTURE Stylistic analysis of Quirigua’s monuments associated with the long rule
of Cauac Sky reveals a fundamental break with the carving traditions of its formidable neighbor
to the south, Copan. Further, the sources of Quirigua’s Late Classic sculptural style are seen to
come from long-established sculptural workshops In the Usumacintla drainage. Elements of
monument carving style from Yaxchilan, Salinas de las Nueve Cerros, Cancuen, and Piedras
Negras relate directly to the post-9.15.6.14.6 monuments at Quirigua. The implications of this ar-
tistic evidence is evaluated in the light of new University Museum data which, along with

\imited to a discussion of its context and use and has been unable to explore exchange routes. In

paleoindian through the Historic. Dalton remains are particularly plentiful, There is a possible
population decline during the Hypsithermal over much of the area and another during early-
middie Woodland times. Mississippian begins abruptly by at least A.D. 800 and experiences pop-

metal artifacts, mostly apparently prehispanic. Metallurgical analysis indicates that nearly all
are of copper, but silver is also present. Manufacture was by heating and hammering or by
casting, and smelting residues indicate it was a local industry. Most artifacts were recovered
from house floor trash or midden layers, but some, especially copper rings, were used as burial

CAL STUDY OF A CONTEMPORARY HERDERS' SITE IN SOUTHERN GREECE The study of a con-
temporary pastoral site in the Southern Argolid of Greece has been conducted since 1978. The
site is located in a natural limestone sinkhole where there have been Neolithic findings. Contem-
porary use by herders is evident by the presence of hearths, fold enclosures, and dense artifact
disposa!. Over a period of two years, we have mapped features and artifact concentrations. In the
winter of 1978-1979, actual use of the sinkhole by sheep and goat herders was observed and
monitored. The preliminary results are the definition of site formation processes as observed by
recording of features and spatial jocation of material objects and actual ethnographic observa-
tion of human and animal activities in the sinkhole. From our data base, we tested the ar-
chaeological assumptions that (1) animal husbandry practices and human occupation could be
inferred from the distribution of cultural materials used, disposed, or dropped al the site; and (2)
artifact concentrations at certain loci were indicative of activity areas where cooking, animal
feeding, animal watering, and sheltering actually occurred. (61)

especially prevalent in early levels at a number of glacial lake-related sites. It remains the
predominant lithic type throughout the deepest levels with other materials noticeably absent. It is
suggested that crystal quartz was used as a |ithologically acceptable substitute for the cherts ex-

aspects of tools as they related to the tasks performed at the site. In many cases, especially
small-scale, short-term occupations, the tool sample is quite small, due to natural and cutural
factors (e.g, curation). In such situations, a technological analysis that will reveal as much as

study of Kaftari period (ca. 2200-1800 B.C.) finds and features from 13 separate excavation opera-
tions in tive different locations at Tal-e Malyan reveals sufficient diversity to demonstrate spatial-
functional intrasite variability for the Kaftari period. A distinct functional profile is constructed
for each location. Locational information, functional classification, and depositional context are
used to support these profiles, which are then discussed in terms of their meaning for the overall
Kaftari occupation at Malyan. (7)
Niemezycki, Mary Ann (SUNY-Buffalo) MATRILOCALITY AND IROQUOIS ARCHAEOLOGY: MYTH
82
, .
AND REALITY Certain assumptions based on the concept of lroquoian matrilocality and its
presumed effect on the patterning of ceramic attributes have become widely accepted among ar-
chaeologists in the Northeast. However, examination of these assumptions in the light of cross-
cultural, ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence shows that they frequently fail to fit the
reality of the data. The misconceptions fostered by these assumptions pose problems in the
analysis of archaeological data and in subsequent attempts to reconstruct the sociopolitical
development of the Iroquois. This paper attempts to separate myth from reality in what we can ac-
tually assume and suggests what we can, in reality, expect ceramic remains to teil us about the
sociopolitical organization of their makers. (35)

Nolan, James L. (Columbia) HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY: CULTURE HISTORY AND IRRIGA-
TION ON THE NORTH COAST OF PERU Survey and test excavation in the Lambayeque-Zafia in-
tervalley zone indicates the existence of a previously unrecognized North Coast polity. This Lam-
bayeque state developed in response to Mochica incursion into the zone (A.D. 500-700) and
gradually advanced towards the south, influencing the nascent Chimu state (A.D. 700-1300).
Despite retrenchment, it retained local sovereignty until the Chimu-Inca entry into the zone, ca.
A.D. 1450, just prior to the Spanish Conquest in 1532. Organizational, production, and population
models for the Lambayeque-Zafia zone between A.D. 500 and 1550 are developed from the
reconstruction of irrigation patterns and settlement patterns. (46)
Norr, Lynette (Illinois) BONE CHEMISTRY AND PREHISTORIC DIET: INITIAL RESULTS FROM
COSTA RICA Various problems which arise from attempts to reconstruct prehistoric diet from
bone chemical analyses are discussed. Particular attention is given to several recent studies on
stable carbon isotope ratios in bone collagen as an indicator of the dietary utilization of either
maize or marine foods. The preliminary results of the application of stable isotope and trace ele-
ment analyses to human bone samples from coastal and inland Costa Rican sites (A.D. 300-1500)
are presented, The possibility of diet reconstruction for prehistoric populations whose intake is

Oliver, José R. (Illinois) QUEBRADA cc A NEW SALADOID STYLE IN PARIA, VENEZUELA
The style has the closest affinities wifh the Saladoid complexes of Cardpano, Paria and Trinidad
as well as the earllest styles in the Caribbean. Its most direct ancestral origins relate to the Mid-
die Orinocan Saladoid (Ronquin). It was hoped that Balerio would fill the chronological gap (of ca.
900 yrs.) that would connect the Coastal Saladoid with the Orinocan Saladoid. The style has been
relatively dated from ca. 100 B.C. to A.. 300. The gap, apparently, still remains unfilled. The
“jump” from the Orinoco into the Coast still remains unclear. J. M. Cruxent, testing the site in
1974, obtained a conflicting C-14 date of 6760 + 130 B.P. (#1597 W.S.U.) which prompted the
writer to make further research and collect charcoal and shell samples for C-14 analysis. (19)
Orcutt, Janet D. (UCLA) RESPONSES TO FOOD STRESS ON THE PAJARITO PLATEAU: AN
ANALYSIS OF PUEBLO SITE LOCATIONS An analysis of pueblo site locations during the Coali-
tion (A.D. 1200-1325) and Classic (A.D. 1325-1600) time periods on the Pajarito Plateau, New Mex-
joo, has shown interesting patterns which may be related to food stress, Using climate as an in-
dication of food stress, it is suggested that the stresses during the two time periods were of dif-
ferent magnitudes. The proposed responses to the stress are diversification of food resources
utilized during the Coalition and intensification of agriculture during the Classic. An analysis of
site locations by elevation suggests these responses may have occurred. Site catchment
analysis is used on a sample of site to better clarify the results of the elevational analysis. (54)
Osborn, Alan J. (Nebraska) COASTAL POPULATION DENSITY AND MARINE RESOURCES:
RESOLUTION OF AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL PARADOX Since the early population studies by
Mooney and Kroeber, anthropologists have assumed that coastal densities were among the

83
, highest for aboriginal North America. Recent investigations demonstrate that aquatic resources
and related exploitative strategies are less than optimal. Resolution of this paradox becomes
essential if anthropologists are to gain nomothetic insights into coastal/maritime adaptations.
This critical problem is solved if one differentiates between gross versus effective population
density. Once this conflict Is resolved, a number of anthropological implications are explored.

Pailes, R. A. (Oklahoma) COLONIAL EXCHANGE SYSTEMS AND THE DECLINE OF PAQUIME Us-
ing spatial models of administered market systems and archaeological data from northeastern
Sonora, we argue that the Mesoamerican trading town of Paquime declined because it was
unable to maintain administrative contro! of local economies in its hinterland. This failure was
due to an inherent weakness of the Mesoamerican trading system on the frontier, such that the
Southwestern indigenes were not drawn into a dependency relationship with Mesoamericans.
This mode! may explain the cyclical pattern of Mesoamerican trading activity in the Southwest.

Parris, David C. (New Jersey State Museum) FAUNAL EVIDENCE OF SEASONAL OCCUPATION
‘OF THE ABBOTT FARM LOCALITY Among approximately 2600 animal bones excavated from the
third humus horizon of the Abbott Farm Site, 60 specimens serve as seasonal evidence. The
materials include frontal bones of male deer (Odocoileus virginianus), juvenile dentitions of deer,
plates of sturgeon (Acipenser sp.), bones of migratory birds, and specimens of at least three
genera of turtles (including Terrepene carolina, Chrysemys rubriventris, and probably
Malaclemys terrapin). Although warm weather occupation is most easily demonstrated, there is
good evidence for occupation during various seasons in the lowland portion of the site during
Middle Woodland times. (48)
Parry, William J. (Michigan) THE USE OF EDGE MORPHOLOGY IN FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICA-

presented. Attributes examined include edge angie, edge shape, edge wear patterns, tool size,
and lithic material. Patterns of association and covariation permit definition of tool classes
thought to represent generalized functional types. This approach is applied to a fragmentary col-
lection from the Garnsey site, New Mexico, and an “amorphous” surface collection from Negros
istand, Philippines. In both cases, tool classes defined by edge morphology show spatial pattern-
ing reflecting functional differences between activity areas and between sites. It is analysis of
subsistence and settlement systems. (17)

IN FORMATIVE ECUADOR Final! results of the phytolith analysis of archaeological soil from Real
Alto, a large Valdivia site in coastal Ecuador occupied from 3500-1500 B.C., confirm the
preliminary evidence for maize (Zea mays L.) cultivation and suggest the presence of a second
cultivated plant, achira (Canna edulis Ker.). Further testing of the method of identifying maize
phytoliths archaeologically is described and the method employed to identify achira is dis-

Periman, Stephen M. (Virginia Commonwealth) RELATIVE STABILITY OF COASTAL AND IN-
TERIOR ADAPTATION The relative stability of coastal and interior hunter-gatherer adaptations
are analyzed for both social and economic variables. The analyses are linked to the biological
and behavioral characteristics of subsistence resources and man's capacity to exploit them.
High productivity coasts are expected to provide the most stable subsistence resources for
hunter-gatherers, while marginal costs are lower and more effective resource exploitation results.
These conditions play important roles in determining the hunter-gatherer social systems occupy-
ing interior zones and high productivity coasts. The results are lower social costs for these
coastal social systems and a more stable adaptation. (50)

reveals the presence of cross-shaped silica bodies identifiable as maize (Zea mays L.) in deposits
associated with the Monagrillo phase occupation of the site. Preceramic deposits from
Aguadulce produce no maize phytoliths and very few cross-shaped phytoliths of any size. The

ZONE RESOURCE EXPLOITATION ON THE NEVADA TEST STIE Ongoing archaeological
research on the 3500 km* Nevada Test Site, southern Nye County, Nevada, is oriented toward
understanding hunting and gathering adaptive systems and their processual changes through
time. The determination of how aboriginal populations exploited their dynamic environment is
basic to such a research design. This paper discusses the empirical evidence for aboriginal pat-

The SARG data bank was structured specifically to meet reseach goals identified by participants.
As those goals have changed and, especially, have been refined, the structure of recording and

Portnoy, Alice W (Texas Tech) EFFECTIVE USE OF PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD
Deliberate, planned and explicit use of the personal experience that field staff and crew members
have during archaeological projects can enhance understanding of the project environment and
how it may have been utilized in the past. It can also enhance learning during field schools. How
to use this experience effectively is the subject of an ongoing study which uses prefield group
briefings and workshops, analyses of field not@ and journals, questionnaires and postfield
debriefing individual taped interviews. The importance of the prefield activities and the need for
additional activities during the project or field school are demonstrated and further suggestions
made. (5)
Powell, Shirley and Michele Seme (Southern INlinois)¥A REEVALUATION OF INTERPRETATIONS
OF FAUNAL INVENTORIES ON SMALL ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES Variation in prehistoric site
morphology has commonly been interpreted as indicative of variation in the activities performed
at the sites. Preliminary analysis of faunal remains from sites located on Black Mesa, northeast-
ern Arizona, has identified a covariation between site structural diversity and faunafidiversity. The
covariation has been interpreted as supportive of an interpretation of functional variability bet-
ween classes of sites. Subsequent studies have suggested that the activities performed at
presumably functionally distinct sites may be similar and that the morphological variability may
be due to the season of occupation. Faunal inventories from the sites will be reexamined to
evaluate both hypotheses. (55)

in response to the demands of environmental protection laws and the questions of contemporary '
archaeologists. The result of these demands is a greatly expanded view of the range of variability :
in the archaeological resources of the region. Departing from the past emphasis on the region's
bluffshelter sites, it is now apparent that the area contains important stratified sites in stream

an opportunity to attack a variety of contemporary research questions. (42)
Raber, Paul A. (Penn State) THE TECHNOLOGICAL BASIS OF CHIEFODOMS Recent study of the
evolutionary position of chiefdoms suggests that the established taxonomies of evolutionary
stages—band, tribe, chiefdom, and state or egalitarian, rank, and stratified societies — may be in-
adequate to acount for the development of chiefdoms and states as recorded in the ar-
chaeological record. Consequently, concern has focused on isolating in chiefdoms those
variables responsible for cultural evolution to and from that level. Reference to ethnographic,
historical, and archaeological cases suggests that technology may be a significant evolutionary
variable. (16)

prehistoric Hohokam populations in the Gila River Valley, particularly those residing in the vicinity
of the Gila Butte. Detailed examination of these features will attempt to discern the prehistoric
mining techniques employed and the volume of material removed from the butte. Combined with

from north European societies of the bronze and Iron ages suggests that economic distinctions
may be of greater relevance. Ranked societies are acknowledged as a special type of society but
are defined with an increased emphasis upon economic factor. (12)

watbons conducted over the last 11 years on Black Mesa, Arizona, suggests differential treatment
of the dead. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that an individual's position in life is
reflected in the treatment it receives at death. Examination of Black Mesa burials proceeds from
two basic lines of investigation: (1) an examination of mortuary practices as derived from the
mode of interment and associated grave goods; and (2) an examination of paleonutritional data
from both macroscopic and microscopic analyses of skeletal material. Data derived from these
amalyses will be compared to determine if a correlation exists between nutritional standing and
Siterential treatment of the dead, and its implications for the social and economic organization
of the Black Mesa population. (54)

defining feature of ranked society is disparity in personal status, which in societies of prominent
ranking implies both dominant and subordinate individuals in le of power and authority. In
sedentary societies there is a positive correlation between the size of a settlement or center and
the status of its dominant authority, and in certain cases social ranking may also be reflected in
the scale of monuments, including funerary ones. An algorithm, the XTENT model, is presented

Richardson, James B. (Pittsburgh) MODELING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEDENTARY MARITIME
ECONOMIES ON THE COAST OF PERU The paper will present a model explaining the shift from
a hunting and gathering economic system to one based on maritime resources at some time be-
tween 7000 and 5000 B.P. The date for the critical shift can be explained by recent results of
geological and climatological research on the west coast of South America. The modern distribu-
tion of littoral resources was not present before 5000-6000 B.P. The appearance of modern en-
vironments and resources on the Peruvian coast at that time allowed the development of
maritime economies. Geological, climatological and archaeological data will be used to support
the model. (15)
Riese, Berthold (Proyecto Arqueclégico Copan, Honduras) LATE CLASSIC RELATIONSHIPS BE-
TWEEN COPAN AND QUIRIGUA: SOME EPIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE A reevaluation of inscriptions
at Copan and Quirigué indicates that late classic relations between these cities consisted in the
adoption of dynastic attributes by Quirigua, a hostile encounter between rulers 18 Rabbit of
Copan and Two Legged Sky of Quirigu4, resulting in the capture of the former in A.D, 736. There is
no evidence that this had disruptive effects upon Copan. A late mention of Copan ruler Sun at
Horizon in Structure 1 at Quirigua suggests that friendly relations were reestablished later on.
This and further evidence from architecture and archaeology should ultimately lead to a more
comprehensive understanding of interactions between Copan and Quirigua in the Late Classic.

Riggs, Rodney E (Wisconsin-Madison) FORT ANCIENT SETTLEMENT IN SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO
Recent surveys in southern Ohio, mainly along the Ohio River and the lower portion of several of
its tributaries, have added considerable new data concerning Fort Ancient settlement behavior.
These data, integrated with that previously recorded, are presented in the form of a description of
Fort Ancient settlement in this area. Further, an analysis of site type and distribution through
various riverine strata, as well as the spacing of the more permanent habitations along stream
corridors, is interpreted in terms of possible cultural and environmental determinants. (40)
Riley, Carroll L. (Southern Illinois-Carbondale) SPANISH CONTACT AND THE COLLAPSE OF THE
SONORAN STATELETS As /ate as the mid-sixteenth century, northern and central Sonora con-
tained a number of political entities which we here call “statelets.” These statelets had incipient
urbanization, and a key position on the major trade route between Mesoamerica and the
Southwest. When Jesuit missionaries recontacted Sonoran Indians after 1620, the statelets had
disappeared and the Indians were living in dispersed rancheries at a very reduced level of culture.
The process of change from more complex to simpler culture is examined and the role of the
Spaniards in this process is analyzed. (53)
Rippeteau, Bruce (State of Colorado) COLORADO AND ENERGY DEVELOPMENT: A STATE
CASE-STUDY. OF RIGHTS Colorado Is a state beset by major plans for oil shale, coal, uranium,

planned or being implemented, e.g., molybdenum and heavy metal mining and massive energy
transport corridors. As a state, Colorado seeks to contro! and minimize adverse aspects of such
development by (1) MOA/Us with federal interests, (2) licensing actions taken under status-rights
auspices, and (3) by influencing companies and local government. Cultural resources manage-
ment well illustrates the frontier at the political and busy state level of interest, and examples of
current and projected work are so presented. (44)
Robbins, Loulse M, (UNC-Greensboro) BIOCULTURAL HETEROGENEITY AMONG THE PRO-

This report focuses on biocultural differences between site populations within the Fort Ancient
region. Analyses of combined factors including physical trait complexes, pathological
manifestations, burial practices, interment locations, and habitational configurations raise the
issue of nonhomogeneous populations sharing a particular assemblage of material cultural
items in a culturally defined area. (40)

Pobertson. James (Michigan State) ANALYSIS OF LITHIC DISTRIBUTIONS AT THE IN-
CONERATOR SITE, DAYTON, OHIO The Incinerator site (33MY57) is an Anderson Focus village
‘ocated on the floodplain of the Great Miami River. Preliminary analysis of ceramics shows
clustering which may reflect matrilocal residence areas. A hypothesis that each household con-
trolled the use of the area between their house and the plaza has been advanced (Heilman 1975).
A Gstridutional study of chipped stone tool types is undertaken to test this hypothesis. However,
Setribution of the lithic materials demonstrates that the processes affecting the discard of stone
tools and debitage differ from those of pottery. Moreover, the behaviors implied by the cross-
‘eeture refits suggest the localization of certain male-associated activities along lines of reflect-

jumeral constituents of the pottery. Descriptive and multivariate statistical analyses of these
Geta helped to identify mineral patterning within them. This patterning was subsequently useful
> tests of hypotheses addressed to pottery production and distribution within the study area. The

Seienson, Eugenia J. (Tulane) SITE HIERARCHIES IN THE PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT IN THE
SULA VALLEY, HONDURAS Prehistoric settlements in the Sula Valley have been disturbed by
agriculture and the frequent meanderings of three major rivers. Sites on the east side of the
southern portion of the valley, however, are remarkably well preserved. Survey in 1979 found a
probable three-tiered Late Classic settlement hierarchy consisting of towns, villages and ham-
ts. Travesia, reported to have once had 1000 mounds, probably was the largest site in Late
Ctassic times and occupied the highest level of the settlement hierarchy. (39)

spatial organization of sites over time in post-glacial environments, we need to understand how
changes in the environmental structure are reflected in the archaeological record, Ecological
models of population distribution in fluctuating environments provide a framework for for-
mutating and testing expectations of Archaic site distributions. Differential visibility of material
culture are expected for the Late Archaic, as well as difterent site distributions and density pat-

cultural changes which distinguish the Late Archaic from the Early-Middie Archaic. (35)
Rose, Richard M. (Hartwick) DESCENDING GODS AND THE MESOAMERICAN BALL GAME
Descending humanand animal figures and diving gods are portrayed in Mesoamerican art from
Preciassic times on. The figures occur from the Valley of Mexico to the Yucatan and highland
Guatemala. Descending and diving figures have been identified with rain and fertility rites and
hallucinogenic drug rituals. There is also a strong association between descending figures and
the Mesoamerican ball game ritual, the figures appearing on thin stone heads, mushroom stones,
and ball game panels. It is suggested that the descending figure motif is representative of diving
ball players and patron deities of the game and the ball. The form, distribution, and significance
of the motif is representative of diving bali players and patron deities of the game and the ball.
The form, distribution, and significance of the motif in ancient Mesoamerican society is dis-
cussed and a cultural chronology for the rubber ball game is proposed. (34)
Rosenberg, Michael (Pennsylvania) PALEOLITHIC AND EARLY NEOLITHIC SETTLEMENT IN THE
MARV DASMT, IRAN Recent surveys extend the prehistoric sequence in the Marv Dasht back to
the Middle Paleolithic. Early Neolithic settlements, however, appear rare if not absent in contrast
to the substantial occupation demonstrable for the preceding and succeeding periods. Artifac-
tual data suggest that early settlements based on cereal exploitation do not occur in the Marv
Dasht, although the available environmental data do not preciude such exploitation. Thus, the
Mushki-Jari ceramic assemblage probably reflects the appearance of an already full developed
neolithic complex of outside origin. (7)

Rovner, Irwin (North Carolina State) THE HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF PLANT OPAL
PHYTOLITH ANALYSIS Plant opal phytoliths are entirely mineralized, silica particles produced
within the tissues of living plants. Many plants, especially grasses and other monocotyledons,
produce vast quantities of varied and distinctive particles. For over a century phytoliths have
been studied as a functional component of living plants and, more importantly, as @ remarkably
durable constituent of soil. However, only within the last decade has substantial progress been
made in utilizing phytolith analysis in archaeology, Current research demonstrates an enormous
capability of providing paleoenvironmental and subsistence data, often the only available
botanical source, in a wide range of archaeological contexts. (3)

PROGRAM Marine survey archaeology has grown enormously in the past five years. There is a
wealth of data potentially available from the remote sensing records which could be used to
reconstruct inundated river banks, estuary areas, and barrier islands. Those landforms were the
tocations of prehistoric and historic habitation sites and watercraft, However, the signals pro-
duced by remote sensing must be subjected to ground-truth tests to determine if the cultural

of bone tools and in studying fracture patterns. Patterns of human behavior are observable In the
way bones are modified and distributed. One can detect prehistoric decisions regarding faunal
resource use in this way. (14)

TURE: A PRELIMINARY MODEL A preliminary model defines Fort Walton culture as a variant of
Mississippian, possessing ranked social organization and a maize agriculture subsistence base.
The initial emergence of Fort Walton culture is attributed to population aggregation in riverine
bottomlands by Late Weeden Island groups. The need to organize larger population aggregates,
coupled with competition from similar groups, resulted in the ranked organization characteristic
of Fort Walton and other Mississippian cultures. Following the initial development, individual
Fort Walton systems increasingly interacted with each other and with other Mississippian
systems. Later, Fort Walton groups expanded out of their narrow riverine environment into
several upland environments suitable for maize agriculture. Settlement pattern shifts in these

tion at the respective workshops was very systematic and specialized toward the manufacture of
only certain tools or too! sets. These findings provide convincing evidence that lowland Maya
craft specialization in lithic production was indeed part of the economic structure by the late
Preciassic, if not before. Late Preciassic and Early Postclassic workshops are compared, impli-

bres Classic Black-on-White ceramic vessels. These findings are used to advance the hypothesis
that Mimbres Classic Black-on-White was basically a utilitarian ware manufactured for certain
domestic uses. Wear patterns on the vessels and vessel context suggest that mortuary vessels
were drawn from the then existing sample of bowls instead of being a specially made class of
pottery. These findings point out a further Taare household or kinship units

based on ceramic associations with burials occurring beneath the floor of a single room. (27)

However, they did not dominate manufacture. With the exception of hamlets, the smallest com-

cess of social differentiation from minimal to moderate ranking may be traced in detail owing to
the availability of well-documented funerary data with close chronological control. (1)

This paper considers the gross distribution of population among early agricultural groups in the

nent parts under changing conditions of transport. information from excavation and survey in
Europe and the Near East has allowed a tentative reconstruction of the distribution and concen:
tration of population at various times in the prehistoric period. The layout of settlement on the
ground determines potential patterns of contact and interaction. Contrasts through time arise
from the changing shape of the network, the agglomeration or dispersal of population within it,
and the efficiency of transport available. (12)

tation and functional analysis of activity areas. Atomic absorption spectroscopy and colorimetry
of sediment samples for calcium (Ca), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) concentrations are cor-
related with data on distribution of lithic debris and data trom microscopic edge-wear analysis of
implements which show evidence of use. The results indicate that increased elemental concen-
trations of Ca, P, and K correlate with the distribution of lithic debris. Furthermore, concentra-
tions of Ca and K correlate spatially with used implements showing wear patterns which appear
to have originated In activities involving bone and wood respectively. The data seems to confirm
the usefulness of chemical analysis as a method for delimiting and analyzing differential use
within archaeological sites. (38)
Smith, Bruce D. (National Museum of Natural History) THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF LATE
PREHISTORIC HORTICULTURALISTS IN THE EASTERN UNITED STATES After A.D. 1000, many
of the floodplains of the larger rivers in the Eastern United States supported horticultural popula-
tions with a fairly uniform adaptation to meander-belt habitat zones. A model is presented that
identifies those variables, both environmental and cultural, that appear to have determined the
spatial distribution of such populations. Environmental! variables to be considered include soil
types and the distribution of oxbow lakes, while cultural variables include the need for boundary
maintenance and social cohesiveness. (36)

DYNAMIC RESOURCE Cultural resource management strategies for prehistoric and historic
. sites have common conservation goals for the i however, the management challenges,
although similar at first glance, are really quite diffefent. When the dynamic dimension of history
is considered, the potential for historic sites is infinite, but the future role for archaeologists has
not been considered. A continuing role for archaeologists is seen, especially in studying the "'in-
| articulate” segments of society, and the need for “anticipatory mitigation” is examined. (62)
Smith, Marion F., Jr., (Oregon) ARCHAEOLOGICAL CERAMICS AS VESSELS: RELATING MOR-
PHOLOGY TO UTILITARIAN FUNCTION The form of ceramic artifacts is largely determined by in-
tended primary function, and much information on the morphologies of parent vessels survives In
sherd assemblages. A mathematical model of vessel form is used by a computer to simulate the
formation of sherd assemblages from functionally-categorized vessels from certain ethnographic
cultures of North America. Certain morphological attributes of these “sherds” are “measured,”
and those that are most effective in distinguishing functional categories are Isolated by a
statistical discriminant analysis. Results (for example, from thé American Southwest) and impli-
cations are discussed. (35)

the La Cabana site (A.0. 1100-1350) adds important new data to the scanty information for ar-
chaeological settlement patterns in Costa Rica. This site, along with Las Mercedes, Guayabo de
Turrialba and other architectural sites surveyed by the author, has stimulated new hypotheses on

cussed in the context of local and regional ceremonial/redistributive networks. The role of the
tropical forest environment on the formation of such networks is emphasized. (2)

models, Transformation models such as behavioral chains and flow models are hypothesized for
several activities that involve either the intentional and/or use modifications of several categories
of non-siliceous stone tools. Examples are drawn from the analysis of surface data from the
Village Creek Archaeological Survey in Arkansas and the analysis of excavated data from the

Spence, Michael W. (Western Ontario) EXCHANGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF RANK Two im-
portant New World transitions are examined: from Early to Middle Formative in Mesoamerica,
and from the early burial complexes to the Hopewellian interaction sphere in North America. In
both cases, the introduction of new commodities triggered a series of social and economic
changes, culminating in the development of an hereditary elite. Trace element analyses of obsi-
dian and silver provide data on some of the crucial trade relationships. An examination of trade
partnership, the institution underlying much exchange in simple societies, reveals some of the
processes involved in the transition. (26)

second half of the 19th century. Expected differences in family consumption patterns are
predicted from probate inventories in conjunction with federal census data. Then individual
families are located on a series of 19th-century maps to form a profile of changing neighborhoods
with regard to ethnic, occupational and socioeconomic status. An architectural and archaeolog-
ical survey locates potential sites where the predicted differences in consumption patterns can
be tested. (16)

* Spickard, Lynda E. (Colorado) STRATEGIES FOR SUSTAINED YIELD OF FISH RESOURCES Hurt-
ing and gathering societies frequently exploit natural resources at less than 50% of carrying
capacity. This practice has been viewed as the product of adaptive strategies designed to guard
against prey populational cycles and environmental perturbations over the long term. How close-
ly do these decision-making strategies compare with ecological and economic models of optimal
yield? Several fisheries models of both trophic-dynamic and single-species exploitative varieties
are discussed. Fish exploitative patterns through 9,000 years of prehistory at Namu, B.C., are ex-
amined from the perspective of sustained yield of resources. (35)

base for this discussion. The Issue of human remains and Native American Religious beliefs is
discussed as an example of the conflict between different communities to whom the archaeol-

ANALYSIS AT THE STREET SITE, OTSEGO COUNTY, NEW YORK STATE: A PROGRESS REPORT
Plant opal phytolith analysis appears to be a potentially useful tool toward explicating both
macro- and micro-environments for archaeologists in the Northeast. Samples from the Street Site
are being examined to determine the feasibility and success levels of such analysis. A variety of
extraction procedures are producing silicified bodies identified at the Class level and lignin frag-

98
, ments identifiable at the generic level. Further testing is in progress. If such analyses are suc-
cessful they will allow for detailed floral studies heretofore unknown in this region, and will offer
not only an alternative to traditional paleoenvironmental studies, but will both support and sup-
plement them. (3)

Stephens, Jeanette E. (Illinois) THE INTRA-SITE SPATIAL STRUCTURE OF MULTICOMPONENT
ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES The spatial structure of archaeological sites reflects the kinds of
decisions that thelr occupants made concerning the organization and utilization of space. At
multicomponent sites the problem of distinguishing discrete areas of usage is particularly dif-
cult to address. However, by considering the distribution of a site's artifactual material as data
related directly to the site as a spatial whole, patterns of site utilization can be distinguished that
transcend the individual idiosyncrasies of particular occupations. A discussion of spatial struc-
turing is presented using data from multicomponent sites in southern Illinois. (35)

VOLUNTEER PROGRAM: DEVELOPING A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROFES-

tionship between members of the professional community and the general public to enhance ar-
cheeological study, management, and education. A community volunteer program provides a
structure which maximizes the mutual benefits derived from such a relationship. The Alexandria
Archaeological Research Center established a volunteer program in 1977 to aid in the study and
survey of the city and to create a community group knowledgeable in contemporary research
goals, ethics and conservation. The implementation, structure, and maintenance of this program,

Steponaitis, Vincas P. (SUNY-Binghamton) eee HIERARCHIES IN NONMARKET CON-
TEXTS: THE FORMATIVE PERIOD VALLEY OF MEXICO A theoretical model is presented which
explicitly relates certain aspects of political complexity to patterned variation in settiement size.
Unlike Christaller’s central place theory, this model applies specifically to hierarchical societies
without well-developed market economies—societies that Service would classify as chiefdoms
and (perhaps) simple states. Using settlement data fppm the Formative period Valley of Mexico, |
show how this model is useful in estimating (1) the number of levels in a regional political hierar-
chy, and (2) the relative amount of surplus food mobilized to support the political establishment.

Sternberg, Robert S., Robert F, Butler and Randall H. McGuire (Arizona) SOME PALBOMAGNET ic
CONSIDERATIONS FOR ARCHAEOMAGNETIC DATING Contradictory evidence exists concern:
ing how magnetization is acquired by hearths. Thermal and alfernating fleld demagnetization ex-
periments indicate that magnetite or titanomagnetite is the primary carrier of the remanence with
blocking temperatures up to 600° C. However, Krause and Eighmy have not measured tempera-
tures above 400° C in experimentally fired hearths. Thus thermochemical remanence may be a
factor although this would not necessarily invalidate archaeomagnetic dates. Hearths apparently
are sufficiently precise magnetic recorders to delineate major trends of geomagnetic secular
variation and allow archaeomagnetic dating. The spatial variation of the geomagnetic field over
the region covered by a secular variation curve presents a limitation to the ultimate precision of
dates. The accuracy of hearths as magnetic recorders can be evaluated by looking at post-1900
hearths and comparing results with observatory records, and by comparing older archaeomag-
netic dates with independent chronological! evidence. (11)

Stothert, Karen E. (Texas-San Antonio) THE EARLY VEGAS ADAPTATION OF SOUTHWEST
GOASTAL ECUADOR Aspects of the adaptation of the early (10,000-7000 B.P.) Vegas people are
discussed. The evidence indicates that the Vegans were sedentary and practiced broad spectrum
hunting and collecting, extending cultural contro! over some plant species by 8000 B.P. Neither
the Vegas technology nor subsistence practices suggest a specialized fishing or shell-fishing
adaptation. Similarities in subsistence, technology and burial practices between the Vegas
culture and cultures of preceramic peoples in northern Peru and Panama suggest a spread of
people along the Pacific coast by sea. (15)
Stright, Melanie J. (Department of Interior) ARCHAEOLOGY ON THE OUTER CONTINENTAL
SHELF: PROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL The legally mandated protection of archaeological sites
on the OCS from the effects of federally permitted actions has been complied with in the past by
avoiding any known or suspected sites. This approach, combined with suboptimal use of remote
sensing equipment, and inadequate methods for further Investigation has yielded little Informa-
tion on the archaeology of the continental shelves. To resolve some of these current problems,
the federal government is funding studies to improve site detection through remote sensing
surveys and core analysis, thus ensuring that avoidance procedures truly protect sites, and also
maximizing information gains in OCS archaeology. (10)

Taimage, Valerie (Massachusetts Historical Commission) A MODEL FOR MANAGEMENT The
planning model provides the process by which the Massachusetts Historical Commission will be
able to make rational and defendable decisions regarding the future of cultural resources in the
state. Resource management strategies vary according to four elements; knowledge of
resources, the resources themselves, threats to the resources, and the constituencies who act
to protect the resources. Since none of these four elements |s constant across Massachusetts,
MHC's management strategies will necessarily vary across the state. Study units divide the state
into manageable areas which allow for analysis of regional trends of each of the four elements.

SOUTHERN AFRICA Recently, archaeologists in southern Africa have begun to investigate the
chemical and physical nature of Iron Age sites. From these analyses, they hope to better under-
stand the nature the occupations and the degree of alteration of the natural soils. Preliminary
results of one such study undertaken on the large (50 hectare) Leopard’s Kopje Phase site dated
st A.D. 940 (eastern Botswana) are reported here. Samples were taken primarily for phosphate
analysis using techniques developed by Eidt, in the hope of defining less obvious occupations
and cattle kraals. Sediment analysis was also done, in order to clarify the complex geomorpho-
logical history of the area. (38)

Thomas, Prentice M. (New World Research, Inc.) TESTING SHALLOW SITES IN FORESTED
AREAS Archaeological techniques are poorly developed for testing shallow sites with low ar-
tifact density in forested areas. A crucial problem is that of collecting adequate artifact sarnples
for chronological placement and assessment of site function. A solution for enhancing artifact
recovery and maximizing horizontal rather than vertical exposure is to use a power driven garden
tiller to prepare the soil for surface collection. By using this technique during a recent testing pro-
gram conducted in the Ouachita Mountains of Arkansas, controlled surface collections compris-
ing a 10 percent sample of each of five wooded sites were successfully undertaken. The method
is cost efficient, and the principal value lies in the extensive horizontal exposure usually attain-
able only in plowed fields or with large scale excavations. (51)

Tiedemann, Clifford E. and Bruce G. Gladfelter (Illinois-Chicago Circle) A COMPUTER PROGRAM
FOR EVALUATING SPATIAL De ee ee Archaeological prospecting and survey-
ing generate spatial numerical data that have been evaluated by a variety of statistical and/or
computer mapping techniques. Interpretation of the data displays from an archaeological point
of view necessarily involves subjective decisions, particularly in the case of remotely derived
slectromagnetic measurements. A computer program has been developed for assessing the
significance of variations of individual data pons within an overall grid network, thereby
isolating anomalous values within the data field. Application of the program makes no assump-
tions regarding the theoretical basis for the derivation of the raw data, but simply evaluates the
spatial pattern of numerical values, and thus it can be used to interpret phosphate survey date or
artifact distributions as well as remote sensing date. (5) '

type (sheepherder camps) is used to illustrate some of the basic characteristics of such a settle-

such as seasonality, number of occupants, resources exploited, and length of occupation will
allow a more Informed investigation of the range variation in other variables such as site size,
placement, and structure. (4)

Townsend, Alex H. and Daniel G. Roberts (John Milner Associates) PROBLEMS IN ARCHAEO-
LOGICAL MODELING AND SAMPLING IN PHILADELPHIA This paper focuses upon a discussion
of archaeological predictive modeling and sampling in Philadelphia based upon data recovered
during two recent investigations. Accurate prediction of urban archaeological resources is
shown to be dependent upon a number of informational sources, such as historic maps, city or-
dinances, tax records, knowledge of percolation factors and existing basement depths. A number
of methodological problems often arise, however, when an attempt is made to test such models
through sampling and excavation. In typical urban investigations probabilistic sampling is often
not possible due to problems of limited access created by such factors as lack of structural in+
tegrity, water seepage, or delayed tenant evacuation. The problems noted in this paper are
thought to have applicability not only in Philadelphia, but also in a wider range of urban settings.

IN NORTHEAST IRAN Emphasis on central organizations in studies of complex societies not on-

arrangements crucial to boundary maintenance. Although strong bureaucratic organizations
developed in Iran between 250 B.C. and A.D. 641, settlement, ceramic and literary data concern-
ing the Damghan plain (northeast Iran) suggest that contro! over this outlying region operated
through local structures rather than directly through an appointed bureaucracy. Thus, the central-

PRESERVATION IN PHILADELPHIA This paper discusses, from a management perspective,
swmerous concerns relating to archaeology and preservation éfforts in Philadelphia. A need Is
seen for more rigorous compliance with cultura! resource legislation, more interpretation of ar-
cheeological work with historical problems and concerns, more correlation between empirical ar-
chesological data and historic documentation, and more rigorous interpretive analyses, rather
than descriptive analyses, in future archaeological work in Philadelphia. Of particular importance
ts the need for better and more advanced planning with regard to Philadelphia archaeological
resources. It is believed that only with the involvement of archaeological input and planning In ad-
vance of project-specific design by urban planners, engineers and developers will we be better
able to ensure the adequate recording and preservation of archaeological resources in Philadel-

ORGANIZATION OF THE CLASSIC HOHOKAM In several recent papers it has been suggested
that the Hohokam developed a complex, hierarchically ranked political organization during the
Sedentary and Classic periods. Such arguments have been based on both the structure of partic-
ular sites and on regional settlement distributions. This paper expands on these findings through
the use of locational techniques. Network analysis, rank-size and other spatial statistics are used
to assess settlement distributions in the Lower Salt and Gila River valleys. An alternative model
focusing on automonous political hierarchies and status differentiation is presented to account
for the development of the Classic period Hohokam system. (36)

moreover, the “collapse” seen at nearby Copan is not evident here. Rather, a profound change in
settiement configuration, location and construction seems datable to the Mid-to-Late
Postclassic. Further analysis will clarify various processes operating prehistorically, such as the
growth and development of regional settlement systems and interactions between the valley and
periphery-wide trade and communications networks. (39)

dynamic behavior (Prigogine, 1978, et al.), which argues for nonreversable and abrupt, rather than
evolutionary, changes in structure. in the model, the moment of change is—theoretically—pre-
dictable, but its nature is not. Such prediction requires measures of the amount of Information
processed and the information processing capacity. In the paper, such measures are developed
and several examples of transition between systems states are addressed. Pottery manufacture
and trade is the system considered. (26)

VALLEY: AN EXAMPLE OF “UPWARD COLLAPSE”? Examined with archaeological and paleo-

brought about by fluctuations in the availability of staple wild food resources led to competition
and ultimately to the demise of certain Late Archaic cultures in the Midwestern U.S. The possible

topography, proximity to water sources and cultivable land, and routes of access are considered
in attempts at explaining settlement patterns, and the sites are compared in size, layout and

| Yoorhies, Barbara (California-Santa Barbara) RESEARCH REPORT ON THE SOCONUSCO
PREHISTORY PROJECT The 1978-79 season focused on the acquisition of basic archaeological

| Sata within a virtually unstudied region (approximately 650 sq km) of the coastal lowlands of
Chiapas, Mexico. Approximately 100 sites were located using a combination of reconnaissance
methods and the analysis of surface-collected ceramics. This work documents a continuous
regional occupation from the Early Preciassic Period to the Colonial Period. Using these data, the .

opaper will formulate hypotheses about site functions, settlement locations, and economic in-
teractions. These hypotheses will be tested In future research Involving excavation at selected |
sites. (34)

REGIONAL SOCIAL NETWORKS OF EGALITARIAN SOCIETIES: AN EXAMPLE FROM THE
NEOLITHIC OF NORTHWESTERN EUROPE A model of change in egalitarian social organization
ts evaluated with data from the Western-TRB period of northwestern Europe. Trends in intersite
pottery design similarity support the conclusion that the increased significance of regional
social networks associated with tribal organization can be understood as a response to in-

. creased environmental variability accompanying subsistence shifts to food production. The ap-
propriateness of different measures of regional interaction intensity is discussed. Measures of

| intersite design similarity based upon continuous design attributes are apparently more ap-
propriate as indicators of interaction intensity than are measures based upon design element fre-

| quencies. (58)

survey in the highlands of northeastern Connecticut indicate that these models should be reeval-
vated. Based upon new data, hypotheses are presented which predict that the highlands were
capable of supporting a year-round settlement-subsistence system, particularly during the Late
Archaic period. (29)

CIENT SUBSISTENCE IN SOUTHWESTERN OHIO Results of analyses of the floral and faunal re-
mains from the Incinerator site, an Anderson Phase/Fort Ancient stockaded village in south-
western Ohio, are presented. These data enable one of the most complete accounts now avail:
able of subsistence and associated technology in a Fort Ancient village. Although occupied year-
round, quantitative analysis of deer remains suggests that the number of individuals actually
present at Incinerator varies, depending on the season. Because the village was occupied for a
relatively short span (perhaps 50 years), one can also examine social differences as reflected in
the plant remains. (40)

The classification of topography is presented as an effective means for regional stratification.
Specific classes of topography that have been distinguished on the Pajarito Plateau In New Mex-

this varlabllity, differential sampling strategies are employed for each class of topography. This
method of topographic stratification is set into the context of an effective running analysis and Is
argued to greatly facilitate large-scale regional archaeology. Emphasis is placed on the practical
application of this method to a variety ot regional research problems. (16)

EQUILIBRIUM APPROACH TO THE STUDY OF ECONOMIC CHANGE Optimal foraging models of-
fer an alternative approach to the study of temporal changes in the resource exploitation
strategies of prehistoric communities. This paper examines the evolution of hunting patterns in
the Tehuacan Valley from an optimal foraging perspective. Temporal variations in prey selection,
seasonality of hunting, and prey capture and preparation methods suggest a history of increasing
intensification of animal exploitation by the valley hunters in response to a generally declining
animal resource base and growing demands. These conclusions are discussed with reference to
Flannery’s (1968) systems model of agricultural origins in Mesoamerica. (34)
Weigand, Phil C. (SUNY-Stony Brook) THE EXTENT OF THE TEUCHITLAN TRADITION The core
area of the Teuchitlan tradition was the highland and barranca zones of northwest and north
Jalisco and east Nayarit. Its roots were in the more generalized Formative cultures of Jalisco,
Nayarit, and possibly Colima, which were characterized by complex shaft tombs. By the Late For-
mative, the differential development of the Teuchitian-Etzatlan-Tequila region is evident. By the
Middle Classic, ca. A.D. 400-700, a remarkable population implosion had concentrated most set-
tlements into six large habitation zones. One zone, at Teuchitian, exhibits primitive urban
characteristics. The entire area was totally reorganized during the early Postclassic. The
106
, Teuchitian tradition's territorial extent, settlement pattern, and exotic circular architecture, at
various stages of development, are discussed. (41)

SETTLEMENT-SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES IN COASTAL ENVIRONMENTS: PRELIMINARY
SYSTEMATICS AND APPLICATION The recent focus of coastal research had emphasized the
comparative study of settlement-subsistence strategies in coastal environments. While coastal
archaeologists are rapidly moving towards a global orientation, the basic analytical units are stil!
predominately defined on the basis of local stylistic criteria hindering broad scale comparative
research and synthesis. A solution to this problem involves the creation of analytical units in-
dependent of but applicable to local data sets. A paradigmatic classification of settiement-
subsistence system types is developed and its application to the archaeological record is
discussed. (50)

of southwest Florida |s characterized as being a large, sedentary, complex chiefdom. This is ac-
complished with a hunting and gathering economy utilizing highly productive and continuously
available tropical coastal resources. A hierarchical political system is seen as a necessary
mechanism to minimize risk factors and even out differential productivity characteristic of this
environment. The political centers of this adaptation correlate with two areas of extremely high
productivity. A large, sedentary population cannot be supported in this environment without this
level of sociopolitical development. (50)

Lake Erie is used to examine the a in spatial distribution from Early Woodiand (500
B.C.-A.D. 200) into the Whittlesey (A.D. 1250-1650) cultural period. Data on 175 sites with 183 iden-
tified cultural components were collected between 1976 and 1978. The function of each compo-
nent was established by using burials, earthen structures, ceramics and other occupational
variables. Each cultural period was computed for nearest neighbor values, and from this analysis
spatial distribution varied not only between major cultural periods, but also between sites with
different functions within a settlement pattern of a period. (36)

INTERACTION IN THE SOUTHEASTERN MAYA PERIPHERY The paper discusses the results of
two conferences held to compare the ceramic data from a series of sites located in the southeast
Maya area (Copan, Quirigua, Chalchuapa and Santa Leticia). The studies were based upon side
by side comparisons of typological and form classes from these sites, supplemented by compo-
sitional paste analyses. The temporal and spatial patterning revealed are seen to reflect
economic and sociopolitical interaction within this area. Shifts in this patterning appear to
reflect changes in political and economic networks and are seen to be consistent with other
reconstructions of prehistoric development in the southeast Maya area. (39)

detrital and chemica! argillites, their hornfelsed equivalents and hornfelsed shales and
mudstones can be arrived at through X-ray diffraction, a form of mineralogical analysis. Correla-
tion of resulting identifications of rock type with archaeological typological and functional
classifications provide information concerning lithic utilization by prehistoric populations occu-
pying the Abbott Farm Site area during the Middle Woodland times. (48)

Windes, Thomas C. (National Park Service) ARCHAEOMAGNETIC DATING: LESSONS FROM
CHACO CANYON, NEW MEXICO Recently, there has been an increased interest in and use of ar-
chaeomagnetic dating in the Southwest. The method has tremendous potential not offered by
other dating methods, but unfortunately few archaeologists understand its potential or limita-
tions. Archaeologists have rushed to secure their own samples, with some lamentable results.
Lack of sampling experience, poor equipment, and lack of communication between ar-
chaeologists and the labs have led to probiems thal threaten refinement of the technique. The
causes of some of the more critical problems are pointed out and reasons for the relatively good
success of archeomagnetic dating in Chaco Canyon are discussed. (11)

Wing, Elizabeth S. (Florida State Museum) ANIMAL USE AS ONE ASPECT OF EARLY COASTAL

southern Ecuador (OGSE 80) have associated faunal remains that provide information on animal
use between 10,000 and 5000 B.P. These data indicate that both terrestrial and marine resources
were used, presumably for food, and that one animal—the fox Dusicyon sechurae—had other
cultural significance, This evidence of early animal use is compared with similar data from later
sites of the same area. (15)

DETERIORATING AGRICULTURAL CONDITIONS AT BROTTA SCALORIA, SOUTHEASTERN
ITALY, DURING THE NEOLITHIC Adjustment in the subsistence base of the farming population
at Scaloria cave is indicated by a shift to hunting, shown by tools and an increased reliance on
wild animals. A developing agricultural crisis may be inferred: discoveries in more inaccessible
passages suggest a water cult, related to climatic conditions and water shortage; mass burials
provide skeletal evidence of disease and cannibalism; abandonment of the settlement is cor-
related with widespread desertion of sites throughout the region. (30)

Wise, Cara L. (Catholic) CHANGING COLONIAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN DELAWARE'S
COASTAL PLAIN The completion of comprehensive archaeological surveys in two areas of
Delaware's Coastal Plain have made possible the development of an ecological or landscape-

a shift in farmstead settlement patterns in the period 1720-1740, which is also associated with
the development of the milling industry and the rise of towns. This change in settlement patterns
can be related to changes in agricultural economy. (61)

Wolfman, Daniel (Arkansas Arch. Survey) ARCHAEOMAGNETIC DATING IN ARKANSAS AND
THE BORDER AREAS OF ADJACENT STATES Recent archaeomagnetic reseach in Arkansas and
the border areas of adjacent states indicates that the configuration of the polar curve for the ap-
proximate time period A.D. 1200-1500 in this area is quite similar, but not identical, to the con-
temporaneous Southwest curve. Limited data suggest that the similarity existed in some earlier
time periods as well. The archaeomagnetic dates thus far obtained from sites where ages were
known by other methods for the most part agree remarkably well with the estimates made by the
archaeologists who were in charge of the excavations. (42)

Wolynec, Renata B. (Edinboro) TESTING CALDWELL’S “PRIMARY FOREST EFFICIENCY” CON-

CEPT USING FEATURE DATA FROM THE KOSTER SITE Several aspects of Caldwell's “primary

forest efficiency” concept were tested by analysis of the 1970-72 feature population from the

Koster Site. The results support the assumptions that during the Archaic there was a progressive

increase in overall cultural complexity, in increase in the variety and specialization of tools,
108
, cyclical reuse of settlement space, some degree of sedentism, and an increase in population
size. However, the feature data indicate that certain of these characteristics occurred at Koster at
least 1,000 years earlier and some at least 3,000 years earlier than predicted by Caldwell. (23)
Wonderley, Anthony (Corneil) POSTCLASSIC NACO, HONDURAS Naco is known to Mesoameri-

work at that site suggests a rapid transition from village to trade community. Naco’s commercial
prominence is associated with the initiation of a transisthmian trade corridor across Honduras
and the arrival of several foreign groups of Mexican derivation. The research documents a
substantial movement of goods, peoples, and ideas in the southern periphery of Protohistoric
Mesoamerica. (39)

Wylie, M. Alison (SUNY-Binghamton) ANALOGICAL ARGUMENT IN ARCHAEOLOGY In connec-
tion with their commitment to a scientific methodology, New Archaeologists have severely
criticized traditional research in which loose analogical interpretations of the data, accepted on
conventionalist grounds, stand as the final conclusions of investigation. As a program has
developed, an extreme position has been adopted whereby all analogical argument is, ideally,
relegated to the prescientific context of discovery while the properly scientific arguments of ex-
stanation and confirmation are held to be deductively structured and empirically “validated.”
This paper argues that analogical inference figures centrally in scientific contexts. It will also
show, that in acknowledging the role of analogy in explanation and confirmation, the field is not
mecessarily abandoned to uncontrolled speculation. A set of formal and empirical criteria will be
®escribed by which the strength, if not the validity, of analogical arguments may be (and, in prac-
tee, generally is) evaluated such that the use of analogy may be made to conform to the New Ar-
eheeology's demands for rigorous empirical control and testing. (16)

been uncritical. Little attention has been paid to the goals and restrictions of the model, to con-
cepts, to relationships among and manipulation of variables, or to dimensions. These problems
are examined in light of Speth’s mathematical model of spalling. It is shown that: (1) inap-
propriate uses of concepts, equations, and dimensions exist; and (2) important differences in the
cutcome of the application of Speth's model result when alternative solutions are presented. (37)
