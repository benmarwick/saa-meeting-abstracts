ABSTRACTS OF ORGANIZED SYMPOSIA
(1) MIMBRES PREHISTORY: RESEARCH OF THE MIMBRES FOUNDATION IN
SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO. The papers synthesize three years of work in the
Mimbres Valley. Various facets of a regional research design combining survey and
excavation of sites spanning an 1100-year period are considered. The relationship between
population dynamics and resource use are considered in several different ways. Evidence for
intraregional trade and the effects of external cultural events are evaluated. New data on
several phases are also detailed.
(2) CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS OF MESOAMERICA: NEW DATA ON
CERAMIC SEQUENCES. This symposium has been organized to present new data on
ceramic chronologies from recent field research in Mesoamerica. Refinements and
elaborations of technique and some basic assumptions about chronology will be examined.
Central Mexican sites to be discussed are Teotihuacan, Xochicalco, Tula, Chalcatzingo,
Mochipala, and Caxtla; and from the Maya region, Los Chuchumatanes, Guatemala.
(3) THE POTENTIAL OF DEBITAGE IN CULTURAL INTERPRETATION. Debitage
comprises a major portion of the total artifact assemblage at most prehistoric sites and may
even be the only type of artifact recovered from a locus. As such, it also usually occurs in
sufficient quantity to support statistical treatment. Yet debitage has been cursorily
examined in most artifact analyses with interpretation restricted to the narrowest
technological levels. Our goal in this symposium is to begin to explore the vast potential of
this category for cultural interpretation. Papers presented here will utilize debitage data to
gain insight into a wide range of questions of archaeological interest such as activity
location, function, and chronology.
(4) VOLCANISM AND HUMAN HABITATION IN THE NEW WORLD. Depending on its
nature and magnitude, a volcanic eruption can have major detrimental or beneficial effects
on human habitation, or the effects can be minor and brief. The effects of volcanic activity
on environments ranging from arctic to tropical and on societies ranging from band to state
are examined by symposium participants. A multidisciplinary approach is emphasized, with
contributions from archaeology, geology, palynology, geography, and zoology. Geographic
coverage extends from Alaska to Central America.
(7, 16) STONE AGE ARCHAEOLOGY IN MEDITERRANEAN EUROPE, Research in the
past decade has greatly expanded knowledge of stone age archaeology in Mediterranean
Europe. New methods, techniques, and theories, a greatly enriched corpus of data, and a
growing international body of scholars have led to many reformations of understandings of
the course of prehistory and the factors affecting it. This symposium brings together for the
first time an international group of scholars who have been doing innovative research in the
stone age archaeology of southern Europe. :

(8, 9, 21, 22) EARLY SEDENTARY SETTLEMENTS IN THE MOIST TROPICS OF '
NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA, Part I: FIRST INHABITANTS OF THE TROPICAL j
ALLUVIUM OF NORTHERN SOUTH AMERICA; Part Il: THE NATURE OF VALDIVIA }
AND THE FORMATIVE OF SOUTH AMERICA; Part Ill: EVIDENCE OF POPULATION i

INTENSIFICATION OF AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN THE NEW WORLD. WAS IT A
UNITARY PHENOMENON? In the 1950s it was thought that the tropical forest areas of
South America lagged behind the Central Andes in terms of the appearance of fully effective
agricultural systems. Julian Steward, in the Handbook of South American Indians, presented
a model for the flow of cultural activity down through the Northern Andes and out through
Venezuela into the Guyanas, and from there spreading widely over the Amazon Basin. The
specific details of this model have been questioned, but a general notion of cultural flow
from the Andes into the moist lowlands has prevailed, and to a large degree continues to
prevail in the literature. This notion, though widespread, is not supported by the data from
research along the major rivers of this zone. Wherever intensive archaeological research has
been carried out, evidence of large, stable communities with complex and artistically
elaborate ceramics appear early, usually before 2000 B.C., and often as early as 4000 B.C.
These data when summarized argue strongly for a very different picture for cultural
development, namely that intensive and highly productive cultural systems appear earlier in
the moist tropics than anywhere else in the New World. That the appearance of these new
cultures was marked by an elaboration of religious system and iconographically complex art,
it could be inferred from these data that the beginnings of sedentary agricultural life in both
Mexico and Peru were stimulated by colonization from the so-called Intermediate Area.
Given the amount of data that supports this position, we feel that it has been given too little
consideration by New World archaeologists. It is the purpose of these symposia to change
the prevailing opinion.
(10) THE SOUTHWESTERN ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH GROUP: RESULTS TO
DATE. Results of six years’ research by members of the Southwestern Anthropological |
Research Group are described. Problems that have arisen in the course of the effort are
|
i. |
, identified, A research design to be followed during the next several years is presented. The
symposium summarizes the results of a week-long working conference held last Spring.
(11) MAYA INTELLECTUAL ACHIEVEMENTS IN THE CLASSIC AND POSTCLASSIC.
The fields of architecture, calendrics, literature. astronomy, writing, social organization, and
history as developed by the Maya during the Ciassic and Postclassic will be considered in this
symposium. In particular, the correlation problem will be discussed from the points of view
of history and astronomy both in the Classic and the Postclassic. Studies of architecture and
literary traditions reveal alliances between cities which are otherwise not readily observed.
Epigraphic studies idertify emblem glyphs and patterns of elite social organization. All these
studies lead to further decipherment of the inscriptions and to a better understanding of
Maya civilization.
(12) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE VIRGIN ISLANDS NATIONAL PARK, Research
projects were conducted on St. John, United States Virgin Islands, in 1969, 1970, and 1976.
The archaeology of this area is relatively poorly known and reported to date. This
symposium has been organized to present the results of recent work in this area by National
Park Service personnel and under contract to the service. Topics to be covered include
aboriginal and historic ceramic typology, excavations and stratigraphy, site distribution,
human remains, and faunal remains.
(13) BONE TECHNOLOGY: EXPERIMENTATION, ASSEMBLAGES, AND NON-HUMAN
MODIFICATION. The study of bone technology is a relatively recent development within
the field of archaeology. Extensive experimentation is being conducted at several schools in
order to duplicate and document archaeological bone material identified as culturally
modified. A wide spectrum of studies are being conducted, including analyses of bone
breakage during butchering, flaking qualities and associated debris, bone quarrying, tool
manufacture, and breakage patterns of culturally modified and non-culturally modified
bone. Many of the assemblages being described are from the Paleo-Indian period and
represent butchering tool kits. The kits vary from site to site, the same functions being
performed but different bones selected for the tools. Discussions are centered on the initial
stages of study and the need for further research.
(15) COMPUTER SIMULATION AS ARCHAEOLOGICAL MODEL BUILDING. Computer
simulation has lately come of age as an effective research tool in archaeological model
building. Researchers have developed simulation models dealing with a wide variety of
archaeological problems, including sampling design, assemblage formation, and postdeposi-
tional assemblage modification. This symposium will review these applications, focusing on
data requirements, problems of operationalization, verification, and use of results.
(18) CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT—THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS AND THE
ARCHAEOLOGISTS' EXPERIENCE. Federal legislation has greatly increased the workload
of the archaeologist, requiring an involvement in surveying and excavation for state and
federal projects. The symposium proposes to review the policies and Procedures of some of
the federal agencies most involved in cultural resource management and then have Papers
Presented by archaeologists, who have been working with these procedures, relate their
experiences and plans for the future in their state.
(23, 31) REMOTE SENSING IN MESOAMERICA. Uses of remote sensing in the location
and analysis of archaeological data in Mesoamerica have lagged behind such applications in
other geographical regions. Superficially this fact seems reasonable as much of the area is
covered with dense vegetation. Since the development of more sophisticated sensors—ERTS,
Landsat, Side-looking radar, etc.—the uses of remote sensing technology in Mesoamerican
archaeology have become the focus of renewed attention. Surprisingly, the use of standard
Bl/wh stereophotography has revealed much new data as well, some of which is not even
recoverable through use of standard ground survey techniques. Papers presented in this
symposium focus on current archaeological research in Mesoamerica. The concern is with
analysis of archaeological problems for which remote sensing provided the primary data
collection techniques.
(24, 32) THE DEVELOPMENT OF ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY: A WORLD-WIDE
PERSPECTIVE. To explain prehistoric behavior we must directly observe activities and
material culture in a variety of world societies in order to comprehend the alternative ways
of accomplishing the same ends and in order to test the méaning and relationships of the
antecedents of any hypothesis before that hypothesis is used to predict and explain human
behavior. In short, we must understand the ways in which a variety of Known behavioral sets
results in specific artifacts, artifact patterns, and site remains, so as to provide the
archaeologist with a set of realistic and concrete inferences for testing.
(25) MISSISSIPPIAN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS. Within the last decade numerous long
term regional research projects focusing on Mississippian subsistence-settlement patterns
have been carried out. These studies have resulted in the formulation of fairly detailed late
prehistoric settlement pattern models for a wide variety of different geographical-
environmental situations within the eastern deciduous woodlands. Many of these studies are
still unpublished, and very few have ever been presented at the same time within the context
of an organized symposium. The symposium would, therefore, serve to provide detajlled
summaries of the settlement patterns of late prehistoric (A.D. 800-1400) human
populations over much of the eastern United States.

19
, (26) CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH—
IN PRACTICE. Cultural resource management (CRM) requires both managers and
archaeologists to function with varied organizational settings and to develop research designs
and work programs in new and innovative ways. The symposium addresses practical
problems of cultural resource management and research design within organizational and
conservation contexts.
(27) HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTS AND HUMAN POPULATIONS ON THE PECOS
RIVER, NEW MEXICO. The Pecos River presently transects an area exhibiting limited
physiographic and biotic variability. Yet recent multidisciplinary archaeological research has
demonstrated a diversity in past environments and human adaptive strategies within the
Pecos drainage. The de-emphasis on narrowly focused river basin studies and an increased
concern with the interdigitation of environmental and cultural factors at the interregional
level has resulted in the recognition of a pattern of broad-spectrum adaptation along the
Pecos River during the Holocene. The methodologies, techniques, and results of current
investigations into past human activities have expanded our view of Pecos River archaeology
and are the subjects of this symposium.
(28) PRESENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA. The
purpose of this symposium will be to bring together archaeologists working in Lower
Central America to present and discuss present research. We are defining Lower Central
America as ranging from central Honduras/eastern Salvador to and including Panama. The
opportunity will be presented to discuss regional problems and to refine the substantive and
systematic prehistory of Lower Central America as a whole.
(33) RECENT RESEARCH IN LEVANTINE PREHISTORY. The symposium deals with
problems related to prehistoric adaptations in the Levant. Adaptations of Mousterian
through Pre-Pottery Neolithic cultures are reviewed. Topics covered include lithic analysis,
technological adaptation, settlement patterns, subsistence strategies, and spatial analysis. A
number of papers offer modeling procedures which should be of considerable interest to
New World archaeologists.
(35) PALEOECOLOGY AND HUMAN ADAPTATIONS IN THE LOWER PECOS AREA.
Recent archaeological, paleobotanical, and paleoecological research in the Lower Pecos area
has yielded much new information on prehistoric human ecology in southwest Texas. This
research has been carried out at four localities: Hinds Cave, a large dry rockshelter on the
Pecos River drainage excavated by Texas A&M University and funded by National Science
Foundation; Baker Cave, a large dry rockshelter on the Devil's River drainage tested by
University of Texas at San Antonio; Musk Hog Canyon, a small tributary of the Pecos River,
surveyed by the Texas Archeological Society; and Sanderson Canyon, a moderate tributary
of the Rio Grande River, surveyed and tested by the Texas Archeological Survey.
Information from these research projects will be presented by the participants including
objective, techniques, and preliminary findings. Specific studies that are reported include
material culture, plant use, faunal procurement, culture history, diet, and pollen analysis.
(36) THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF MESOAMERICA: HONDURAS AND EL
SALVADOR. The Republics of Honduras and El Salvador lie within a geographic zone of
upper Central America which is critical to the understanding of New World prehistory. The
prehistoric ‘‘frontier’’ between Mesoamerica and the Intermediate Culture Area transects or
borders upon these two republics. In recent years an upsurge in archaeological field research
in these diverse areas has begun to clarify the interaction and relations between the more
advanced Mesoamerican civilizations, such as the Classic Maya, with those lesser developed
cultures and emergent chiefdoms of a Central American configuration. The symposium
focuses upon some recent results of these research efforts in Honduras and El Salvador, and
discusses the implications of cultural contact, interaction, and evolution along the southern
periphery of Precolumbian Mesoamerica.
(38, 48) CONFERENCE ON MESOAMERICAN ETHNOHISTORY: CODICES AND
MANUSCRIPTS. This symposium will focus upon documentary materials concerning the
high culture areas of native Prehispanic Mexico and Guatemala, and will show the
relationship of these data to the analysis and solution of both Preconquest and Postcontact
problems. The participants, who are from a number of different countries (U.S., Mexico,
Germany) have been invited in order to reflect a broad coverage of current research in this
complex, interdisciplinary field. Their papers will demonstrate how written and pictorial
manuscript sources may be utilized to resolve a wide variety of archaeological, ethnographic,
and linguistic problems.
(39, 49) COMMODITY FLOW AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE ANDES.
Research focusing on various types of economic data indicates wider ranges of political
phenomena and earlier development of some features than generally believed. Work both at
La Paloma on the coast and Pachamachay in the puna indicates the emergence of sedentary
population units with indications of some regional stratification possibly as early as 4000
B.C. Consideration of commodity flow and resource management form the basis of analysis
for the symposium. Participants take one of two general approaches—either the identifica-
tion and discussion of the flow of particular commodities and reconstruction of the
networks of commodity flow, or a discussion and an analysis of how the economic resources
and their control functioned in the maintenance and specific functioning of a polity.
20
, Examples of the first orientation might include the papers on llama trade caravans and the
flow of certain prestige goods (such as ceramics, hallucinogenic drugs, etc.) ; examples of the
second would include the use of labor flow analysis within a site, and the functioning of
redistribution and rite size hierarchies in the Chavin empire.
(40) STYLISTIC ANALYSIS IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Recent studies concerning several
aspects of style will be discussed. Classification systems for stylistic variability will be
presented and methods of statistical analysis evaluated. Several papers will focus specifically
on the use of stylistic change through time to date prehistoric sites. Finally, explanations of
stylistic variability through space will be discussed.
(46) ANALYTICAL APPROACHES IN PREHISTORIC ECONOMICS. The papers of this
symposium attempt to explain different aspects of prehistoric resource utilization using
economic models. Although the models vary considerably, as a group they are heavily
dependent upon formal analysis and decision making theory for their development. The
models are often compared with specific sets of archaeological and ethnographic data,
emphasizing actual test results. Discussions of the papers will be contributed by an
archaeologist and an economic anthropologist.
(50) ARCHAEOLOGY AND NATIONAL FOREST LAND-USE PLANNING. As a part of
its nationwide land-use planning effort, the U.S. Forest Service is, in many areas of the
country, including documentation of the cultural resource. This symposium brings together,
for the first time, a group of archaeologists who have been involved in that effort
nationwide. Since land-use planning units involve literally hundreds of thousands of acres,
the archaeologists concerned have had an opportunity to look at the archaeological resource
from a wide perspective seldom attained in past studies.
(52) LOCATIONAL MODELS IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Recently there has been an increasing
use of geographic models and analytical techniques in the archaeological study of
settlement. As with any new borrowing from another discipline the quality of these
applications has been variable. Nearly all of these applications have failed to fully consider
the specific restraints on the geographic models in modern contexts and what the
consequences of these are for their archaeological application. Here we will explicitly
consider several major models and techniques, the constraints on these, both theoretical and
practical, and the relevance of these to their archaeological applications.
(54) JAPANESE PREHISTORY: ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO OLD AND NEW WORLD
RESEARCH. The view that Japan is the window into Asia is being modified by recent
research in Korea, Southeast Asia, and Japan. Research in Japan is producing cultural
patterns that suggest that preconceived notions concerning its prehistory are being greatly
modified. This process of modification is now contributing to our understanding of events
outside the Japanese archipelago. This symposium will briefly focus on Japanese research in
an attempt to explain how these data aid or alter our world view of prehistory.

, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS*
Accola, Richard M. (Texas-Austin) A PRELIMINARY APPLICATION OF X-RAY
DIFFRACTION ANALYSIS TO THE STUDY OF NICOYA POLYCHROME CERAMICS.
Cultural unity in the Nicoya subarea of Costa Rica has long been assumed on the basis of
the distribution of certain polychrome ceramic types at various time periods. It is not
known whether these distributions reflect local participation in a widespread socioeconomic
system or rather the influence of ‘“‘centers" over other areas. This question can be best
addressed by means of componential analysis of samples of a single type taken from
different areas. X-ray powder diffraction analysis, being relatively inexpensive and easy to
run, Would appear to be an appropriate method. Tests were run on a small sample of one
type of widely distributed ceramics, Mora Polychrome from the Middle Polychrome period
(ca. A.D. 800-1200), in order to determine the suitability of the method for this kind of
study. (28)
Ackerman, Robert E. (Washington State) ARCTIC AND SUB-ARCTIC. Historically, three
periods of investigation of Arctic and Sub-Arctic peoples are discernable: (1) exploratory—
Russian Contact to the museum collecting activities of Boas, Murdoch, Nelson, Rink—
emphasis on material culture as adaptation to harsh environment; (2) early ethnographic—
investigations of Birket-Smith, dé Laguna, McKennan, Jenness, Turner, and others with
social and intellectual aspects of culture added to continuing interest in material culture; (3)
late or modern ethnographic—shift of interest away from ethnographic present to study of
modernization of Arctic and Sub-Arctic villagers. Early archaeology in the region was a
phenomenon contemporary with period (2) where the archaeologist experienced the same
cultural impact as the ethnologist. The approach was basically ethnographic based on data
from period (1) and contemporary inputs of period (2). During the modern period the shift
of ethnography away from material culture and increasing sophistication in archaeological
investigative procedures has stimulated archaeologists to play multiple roles of eth-
nographer, geologist, historian, and naturalist. The complex interplay of ethnography with
archaeology (ethnoarchaeology as an aspect) though of long tradition in the northern
realms, is now entering a new era with new insights. (32)
Adams, E. Charles (Museum of Northern Arizona) THE CHANGING NATURE OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA, OR, HOW TO GET ALONG ON A SCARCE RESOURCE.
Much recent concern in archaeology has been directed toward conservation archaeology, the
preservation of archaeological resources. Little has been mentioned about the data
restructuring inherent in this philosophy. Methodological and analytical tools must be
developed for dealing with this new form of data if contributions to understanding and
explaining culture and cultural change are to progress. (26)
Adams, Karen R. (Eastern New Mexico) SITE CATCHMENT ANALYSIS OF WILD PLANT
RESOURCES IN THE HEAVILY OVERGRAZED RIO PUERCO VALLEY OF NEW
MEXICO. An approach to assessing former wild plant resource availability and utility
without depending on density is presented. A site is chosen and considered “home base"
while literature research on human “exploitation territories" provides a reasonable
boundary for the study. The geology of the area is examined and landforms delineated. A
botanist describes the distribution of plants on landforms to provide a baseline from which
one can work. A model to compensate for effects of overgrazing is applied. Plant species
with known ethnographic uses are scored for “‘potential" value; then landforms are scored
according to the species they support. One can evaluate wild plant resource potential
between contemporaneous or noncontemporaneous sites. Models to accommodate fluctua-
tions in climate may be applied. Limitations of this approach are discussed. (41)
Adams, R. E. W. (see Dahlin, B.) (23)
Adams, William H. (Washington State) ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY OF SILCOTT, WASHING-
TON: A CASE STUDY. Various aspects of ethnoarchaeology are examined in relation to
the study of a small farming community in southeastern Washington. Silcott existed from
the late nineteenth to the early twentieth century as a minor node jin the regional networks.
The combined ethnographic, archaeological, and historical study of that community has
yielded considerable insight into how Silcott functioned as a social unit. In addition, the
study Is in a position to contribute to the methods and theories of ethnoarchaeology,
through its research on cultural materials, trade, and settlement. (45)
Adovasio, James M. (Pittsburgh) MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER: RETROSPECT 1976.
Meadowcroft Rockshelter is a deeply stratified multicomponent site in Washington County,
southwestern Pennsylvania. The 11 well-defined stratigraphic units identified at the site span
at least 16,000 years and perhaps 19,000 years of intermittent occupation by groups
representing all of the major cultural stages/periods now recognized in northeastern North
America. Throughout the extant sequence, the site served as a locus for hunting, collecting,

, and food processing activities that involved the seasonal exploitation of the im mediately
adjacent Cross Creek valley and contiguous uplands. Presently, Meadowcroft Rockshelter
represents one of the earliest well-dated evidences of man in the New World as well as the
longest occupational sequence in the Western Hemisphere. (6)

Adovasio, J. M. (see Andrews, R. L.) (20)

Agurcia, Ricardo F. (Tulane) THE FIGURINES OF PLAYA DE LOS MUE RTOS,
HONDURAS. The collection of Playa de los Muertos figurines from the Middle American
Research Institute of Tulane University is studied. A typology of the figurines is made based
on physical attributes (paste, slip, and paint). Stylistic similarities with figurines from the
northwest are seen that lend support to the view that this area of Honduras was interacting
as a part of the cultural sphere of Mesoamerica during the Middle Preclassic. The customs,
costumes, and coiffures of the Playa society, as reflected in the figurines, are discussed and
reference jis also made to the trade systems, religious practices, and level of sociocultural
development of this society. (36)

Aikens, C. Melvin (Oregon) PROBLEMS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE SURVEY IN
HEAVILY FORESTED REGIONS: SEEING THE GROUND AND LOOKING IN LIKELY
PLACES IN THE WOODS OF WESTERN OREGON. Heavy ground cover effectively
conceals archaeological remains in many forested regions, leading to difficulty in locating
archaeological sites and to the frustration of data-gathering schemes that seek to obtain
representative information through use of internal or random sampling techniques. A highly
judgmental approach, taking advantage of good visibility where it may be found, appears to
be the only reasonable mode of investigation. The use of aerial photos and detailed
topographic maps is a valuable aid to data collection. An element of randomization in
survey coverage may be achieved through examination of man-made clearings in a variety of
terrains. (43)

Aldenderfer, Mark S. (Pennsylvania State) THE COMPUTER SIMULATION OF AS-
SEMBLAGE FORMATION MODELS IN HUNTER-GATHERER ARCHAEOLOGY. One of
the most important assumptions underlying much recent work in the archaeology of
hunter-gatherers has been that of the ‘‘functional argument." Considerable effort has been
directed at the development of quantitative methods for the discovery of “tool kits’ or
“activity areas’ at archaeological sites. The assumption that variability in assemblages of
tools primarily reflects site function, however, has not been rigorously tested, and evidence
from recent ethnoarchaeological studies of hunter-gatherers demonstrates that the use and
discard of tools is extremely complex. Thus quantitative methods applied to these data may
or may not be capturing true functional distinctions. This paper presents a test of the
“functional argument" that is based on the construction of a computer simulation of how
tools “flow” through a material culture system. The simulation creates a record of sites ina
region that can then be used to evaluate the ability of multivariate statistical methods to
recover functional distinctions. The model operationalized by the simulation is based on
ethnoarchaeological data from the Western Desert of Australia. The problems encountered
in the development of the simulation will be discussed, as will the implications of this
research for the study of hunter-gatherer archaeology in general. (15)

Allaire, Louis (Manitoba) FROM PREHISTORY TO HISTORY IN THE LESSER
ANTILLES: THE PROBLEM OF CARIB MIGRATIONS. The paper questions the
historicity of Carib migrations in northeastern South America, especially from the Guianas
to the West Indies, on the basis of (1) recent chronological work on the late prehistory of
the Lesser Antilles, and (2) a critical re-examination of ethnohistorical evidence in support
of a migration theory (e.g., migration myths, male/female linguistic dimorphism, population
distributions, etc.). Moreover, a new interpretation of the previously elusive Island Carib
pottery now makes it possible to re-evaluate cultural continuities and affiliations. The
question is further approached through a more specific definition of the Island Caribs as an
ethnic group, especially in relation to ethnic groups in the Guianas. (21).

Allen, George D. (see Folan, W. J.) (55)

Allen, Richard K, (Western Illinois) AN EASIER WAY TO MAP MAYA RUINS. Traditional
methods for mapping domestic ruins in the Maya Lowlands require different skills and more
time than charting easily visible monumental buildings. Aerial views are a particularly
important aid for interpretation of smaller architecture. Low oblique photographs of cleared
agricultural fields taken at altitudes below 350 meters with medium format cameras clearly
record low mounds with boundary walls surrounding them. Narrow streets or walkways are
visible between tightly packed dwelling complexes. These surface features were outlined on
photographs and their coordinates digitized. The numerical image was then rectified to
pPlanimetric perspective. The resulting map is superior to a chart Produced on the ground
with transit and alidade. (31)
Ammerman, Albert (Stanford) A SIMULATION STUDY OF EXCAVATION STRATEGIES
AT A MAAS! SETTLEMENT. Simulation techniques are used to develop a comparative
study of the results that would have been obtained from the excavation of a Maasi site in
East Africa according to several different sampling designs and strategies. The site employed
in this study is a recently abandoned pastoralist settlement where a detailed recording was
made of the material remains on the site surface. (15)

, Andrews, Rhonda L. (Pittsburgh) THE TEXTILE AND BASKETRY IMPRESSIONS FROM
JARMO. Analysis of a series of negative impressions in clay and bitumen recovered during
the excavations at Jarmo indicate the prehistoric production of both cloth and basketry at
that site. Two varieties of plain woven cloth, balanced plain weave—single warp and weft,
and balanced plain weave—double warp and weft, are represented, as are two of the three
major subclasses of basketry. The latter includes plaiting and coiling, each represented by a
single type. The technical characteristics of these “‘perishables"’ are discussed and the
assemblage is compared to others in the Old and New World. (20)
Anuskiewicz, Richard (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers) THE ROLE OF THE PROFESSION-
AL ARCHAEOLOGIST WITH THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. The U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers is now actively seeking to meet statutory responsibilities concerning the
management of cultural resources. Federal legislative mandates such as the Preservation of
Historic and Archaeological Data, Public Law 93-291, and Executive Order 11593, have
propagated the urgent need for the Corps to develop a comprehensive program to manage
cultural resources. The Corps has responded to this responsibility by initiating a Code of
Federal Regulations (33 CFR Part 305) and by actively seeking and hiring professional
archaeologists to administer their program. This paper will discuss the role of the
archaeologist with the Corps. (18)
Applegarth, Susan M. (Fort Lewis) PALEQOECOLOGY AND PREHISTORIC EXPLOITA-
TION OF THE EASTERN SLOPES OF THE GUADALUPE MOUNTAINS, SOUTH-
EASTERN NEW MEXICO. Research undertaken along three major drainages of the eastern
slopes of the Guadalupe Mountains was designed to answer a series of specific questions.
Included in the areal problems to be resolved were: (1) the relationship of the specific types
of sites to each other; (2) the ecological setting of the sites at the time of occupation; (3)
the portion of the environment being exploited by the occupants of various sites; and (4)
the relationship of the sites in the Guadalupe Mountains to those of the Greater Southwest
and the Southern Plains. The area proved to be one of specialized exploitation of a major
resource. Artifacts recovered from the area suggest links to the Trans-Pecos region. (27)
Arnold, Dean (Wheaton) A REVIEW OF ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES IN
MESOAMERICA, This review of ethnoarchaeological studies in Mesoamerica focuses on
their contributions to archaeological method and theory. It includes studies offered as
general ethnographic analogies, as well as those that assume direct historic continuity. The
paper will also discuss unexplored problem areas where ethnoarchaeology studies would be
particularly useful. (32)

Arostegui, Carlos B. (Dumbarton Oaks) MARRIAGE, ALLIANCE, AND SUCCESSION IN
PRECOLUMBIAN MIXTEC SOCIETY. This paper will present an analysis of the
genealogical data contained in the Precolumbian Mixtec codices. It will examine the
relationship between elite marriages and the establishment and preservation of interkingdom
alliances. The role of marriages between close kinsmen as a mechanism for the prevention
and/or resolution of stresses brought about by succession will also be investigated. (48)
Ashmore, Wendy (Pennsylvania) RESEARCH AT QUIRIGUA, GUATEMALA: THE
SITE-PERIPHERY PROGRAM. The Quirigua Project of the University Museum (University
of Pennsylvania) and the Instituto de Antropologia e Historia (Guatemala) has now
completed three seasons of field research at this Classic Maya site in eastern Guatemala. The
Site-Periphery Program of the project was designed to complement the Site-Core Program
by defining the temporal and functional range of occupation in the vicinity of the
traditionally delimited ‘‘site’’ of Quirigua. In this work, the aim has been to test and develop
several possible models for ancient roles filled by this Maya community and the paper
presented here summarizes site-periphery fieldwork and analyses as of the end of the 1977
research season. (55)
Attebury, Anne (SMU) NEW EXCAVATIONS AT KHARGA OASIS: THE ATERIAN
WORKSHOP (SITE E76-4). The recent excavation of an Aterian workshop at El-Kharga,
Egypt, produced in situ material pertinent to both the general understanding of this area
and the overall character and distribution of the Aterian in Egypt. In addition to a
description of the workshop, this preliminary report considers the relationship of the site to
other material known from this area, as described by Caton-Thompson (1952). Known
Aterian occurrences from Bir Sahara/Bir Terfawi in the Western Desert provide additional
comparative material. This material, while at least broadly comparable typologically, differs
from the site at Kharga in terms of stratigraphic sequence. This discrepancy may suggest
chronological and environmental diversity between the two areas. The implications of this
possibility are presented and evaluated. (20)
Autry, William O., Jr. (Vanderbilt) HUMAN BURIALS FROM W.P.A. EXCAVATIONS AT
MOUND BOTTOM, TENNESSEE (40 CH 8). Ninety-four burials, distributed over five
cemetery areas at the large Mississippian site of Mound Bottom near Nashville, Tennessee,
constitute the burial sample for this report. These burials were excavated between 1936 and
1940 by W.P.A. crews under the direction of C. H. Nash, Stuart Neitzel, and Georg Neuman.
Burial data are summarized from existing W.P.A. field notes and maps in order to synthesize
24
, mortuary practices. Comparisons are drawn with additional Mississippian centers and
stone-box cemeteries from the Nashville basin. The small sample size and poor bone
preservation limit interpretations, but mortuary practices indicate little, if any, differences
in social status. (53)

Ayers, Harvard G. (Appalachian State) CHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF NORTH
AMERICAN CHERT SOURCES. Chemical analysis of cherts from six North American
aboriginal quarry areas was performed. Analytical procedures and statistical treatment of
the data are described. Multivariate analysis of the results indicate that the cherts from the
different quarry areas could confidently be differentiated on the basis of three elements:
Calcium; Aluminum; Iron. (14)

Baker, B. Lea (Ohio State) A TEST OF THE UTILITY OF AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY IN
STUDYING PREHISTORIC MAYA RURAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN YUCATAN,
MEXICO. The use of airplane-flown vertical photography and helicopter-flown oblique
photography played an integral role in the recent study of prehistoric Maya rural or
intercenter settlement patterns in a 158 square kilometer area in northwestern Yucatan,
Mexico. This paper will examine the ways in which these methods of remote sensing were
used and will evaluate their effectiveness in facilitating the recognition and location of
architectural remains, as well as in determining characteristics and distribution of
architectural remains in the Yucatecan environment. (3 1)

Baker, Charles M. (Georgia) PREHISTORIC LITHIC RESOURCE PROCUREMENT,
UTILIZATION STRATEGIES: A GENERAL APPROACH TO STONE AGE ECONOMICS.
Relationships between the technological and typological variability of lithic assemblages and
the types of lithic resources that occur in particular archaeological areas are examined. The
various possible states of raw material availability, abundance, ease of procurement, quality,
and size are considered with respect to observable intra-assemblage variability in order to
suggest potential indicators of different lithic resource procurement and utilization
strategies. These suggested tentative relationships are evaluated in an interassemblage study
based upon chipped stone collections from Mogollon-Mimbres sites in southwestern New
Mexico. (3)

Ball, Joseph W. (San Diego State) THE CERAMICS OF CHIN KULTIC, CHIAPAS,
MEXICO: AN INTERIM REPORT. Analysis of archaeological ceramic collections from the
highland Chiapas site of Chinkultic, Mexico, has permitted definition of a discontinuous
three-phase sequence commencing during the Maya Protoclassic period and terminating
during the Early Postclassic interval. A preliminary outline of this sequence is presented
together with observations on external connections and probable origins for each of its
recognizably distinct segments. (55)

Bandy, Philip A. (Texas Tech) REPORT AND TEST OF A NEW TECHNIQUE FOR
MAPPING AND RECOVERY OF “EXPOSED” ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. “Exposed
archaeology” contains valuable sociocultural information which all too frequently archae-
ologists have not been willing to recover. The main limit to recovery of these data has been
the extreme expense of the present mapping techniques. Now a new mapping technique has
been developed that will allow more expedient recovery of the “‘exposed" archaeology so
common in the Texas and Southwest areas. The construction of the device and its operation
is Presented, including also a recent test in comparison with mapping by a transit and
Planetable/alidade, (29)

Barbour, Warren (SUNY-Buffalo) PREHISTORIC FINGERPRINT IMPRESSIONS: A
METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE SEX OF THE MANUFACTURERS OF FIGURINES
AT TEOTIHUACAN, MEXICO. Sexual differences in ridge width, mean, and variance of
finger impressions have been observed in modern populations. These same differences can be
observed and measured in fired clay. A method has been devised to recover and accurately
measure impressions on fired clay figurines from Teotihuacan (150 6.C.-A.D. 750). With a
large enough sample the sex of the manufacturer can be discovered by applying methods
adapted from modern physical anthropology. The social importance of changes in political,
economic, and religious organization as well as changes in residence patterns inside the
ancient city are discussed. This study offers an unusual chance to relate biological
differences to social change through the analysis of archaeological material. (34)

PRESERVATION, The 1966 National Historic Preservation Act Provided for the establish-
ment of the National Register of Historic Places, the State Historic Preservation Officers,
and a Grants-in-Aid program to conduct cultural resource surveys and acquire or develop
these resources. The National Register is also in charge of reviewing determinations of
eligibility, nominations of cultural properties to the Register, and working with federal
agencies to insure compliance. The discussion will center on the workings of these branches
of the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation and how these can be of help to
archaeologists when working with federal agencies or undertaking research. (18)

, Bayham, Frank E. (Arizona State) PLEISTOCENE MEGAFAUNA: TROPHIC ORGANIZA-
TION AND POPULATION REGULATION. The influence of early man and climatic change
upon the extinction of certain forms of Pleistocene fauna is an unsettled question. The
ability to assess the actual impact of man in this scheme can only come in conjunction with
a detailed awareness of the ecological relationships occurring among those animals present.
Open range herbivores, specifically pronghorns, bison, horses, camels, and mammoths are
examined with emphasis on their position in the trophic chain. Net primary productivity,
population limiting factors, and life history strategies are explored and compared to
estimate the differential effects of climatic change upon certain species. (5)

Benavides, Antonio (INAH) AIR PHOTO INTERPRETATION AT COBA. Coba is noted for
its system of artificial causeways (Sacbeob). These causeways connect architectural
complexes within the central area of that site and join Coba with other more distant
communities, The causeway between Coba and Ixil is 20 kilometers long, while the
Coba-Yaxuna sacbe is over 100 kilometers in length. The causeways are visible in standard
aerial photographs. Enlargement of the photographs illustrates the size and extent of Coba
and its causeways in an even more dramatic fashion. Results of air photo Interpretation In
Coba have direct implications for current discussion of Maya community form and social
organization. (31)

PALOMA, A PREAGRICULTURAL LOMAS VILLAGE. The preagricultural village, La
Paloma (Site 613), occupied over 6,000 years ago in the arid Chilca Basin of central coastal
Peru, is being investigated by a binational (Peruvian and United States), multidisciplinary
team. This village, located just below the present day lomas vegetation, appears to have
contained a large, sedentary population. Yet today, the land is not capable of sustaining any
population except an occasional nomadic herder. The first season focus was the collection
of skeletal material to form the demographic data base, and the collection of ecological and
economic samples (floral, pollen, faunal, dessicated fecal samples, etc.). In addition, a new
research design for handling large amounts of data and its feasibility will be discussed. (39)

Benson, Elizabeth P. (Dumbarton Oaks) REPRESENTATIONS OF POTTERY IN MAYA
ART. Representations of pottery are common on Maya polychrome pottery; they appear in
more limited use in the Maya codices, and are scarcer still on sculpture. Several pottery
shapes are depicted, and these are to some extent interchangeable. Pottery representations
in the codices and some of the pottery on ceramics are containers for ritual mate-
rials—pulque, corn or glyphic elements. In the codices, they are either held by deities or
placed with other ceremonial objects. The cylinder vases shown on the pottery frequently
seem to be objects that are being revered; they appear on, or under, or beside thrones, or
they may be shown in the process of being presented to the chief figure in the scene. These
vases were probably themselves sacred objects, having to do with an earthly king's achieving
a role in the court of the underworld. (38)
Bettinger, Robert L. (NYU) MULTIVARIATE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF REGIONAL
SETTLEMENT-SUBSISTENCE SYSTEMS IN OWENS VALLEY, EASTERN
CALIFORNIA, Multivariate statistical techniques were used to analyze a 5,500-year
sequence of regional settlement-subsistence systems in Owens Valley, eastern California.
Discriminant analysis, employed to develop a quantitative means for classifying sites in
terms of major settlement categories, produced classification schemes identical to intuitive
classifications between 83 and 92% of the time, depending on the kind of data used. Factor
analysis was applied to isolate the principal sources of variation in the archaeological
assemblages at the same sites. It yielded three factors, these being identified as a heavy duty
manufacturing component, a light duty manufacturing, equipment repair, and daily
maintenance component, and a base camp facilities component. (45)
Bird, Robert M. THE EVOLUTION AND INFLUENCES OF THE MAIZE OF THE
INTERMEDIATE AREA. The Intermediate Area can be defined by archaeological,
ethnological, linguistic, ecological, and, now, maize traits. Many maize races developed in
northwest South America and Central America have had a very wide influence since possibly
3000 B.C.; the causes of this are unknown, but several speculations are possible. Certainly
the maize of Guatemala is predominantly Intermediate; that of northwestern Mexico and
the United States may be secondarily Intermediate. The earliest Peruvian maize is almost
certainly from the Intermediate Area, as is the maize of Paraguay and eastern Bolivia. Even
26
, the famous Blanco Imperial of the Cuzco area seems to be heavily influenced by maize of
Cajamarca, an Intermediate center of the first millennium A.D. The broad patterns
described by anthropologists continue to aid in describing maize evolution, and the great
amounts of information accumulated by maize specialists can help guide anthropological
investigation. (22)
Black, Thomas K. III (Michigan) DISCRIMINANT FUNCTIONS ON THE DENTITION AS
AN AID TO THE SEXUAL DIAGNOSIS OF HUMAN SKELETAL REMAINS. The sexual
diagnosis of the skeletal remains of immature individuals is of great interest to the mortuary
analyst. Unfortunately, no reliable means of sexing immature skeletons is presently
available. This paper presents the results of investigations into the sexual dimorphism of the
human dentition. Discriminant functions based on the tooth crown diameters of the
deciduous and permanent teeth allow the remains of children to be sexed with a higher
degree of reliability than was previously possible. (44)
Blake, Michael (British Columbia) ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF THE DEMING
PLAIN: INITIAL RESULTS. Archaeological survey during the summer of 1976 in the
Deming Plain, southwestern New Mexico, is described. The aim of the survey was to expand
on existing knowledge about the range of archaeological variation within the lower Mimbres
drainage. Specifically, sites discovered represented several thousand years, including the
Cochise tradition. For each time period we found differences in the number, size,
structuring, location, and distribution of sites, in addition to a great deal of variation in
artifact assemblages. There were, however, overall elements of continuity through time, with
respect to certain aspects of these patterns. An approach for future Mimbres region survey,
with an emphasis on intra- and intersite spatial analysis is offered. (1)
Bleed, Peter (Nebraska-Lincoln) THE DISCIPLINE THAT WASN'T: ARCHAEOLOGY IN
PREMODERN JAPAN. During the Tokugawa period (1603-1868) developments in the
direction of true archaeological research were independently made by Japanese Confucian
historians, naturalists, and rock collectors. Advances and discoveries in these fields paralleled
developments that ultimately gave rise to modern archaeology in the West. In Japan,
however, intellectual and cultural values precluded the archaeological study of prehistory.
This paper describes the characteristics of early Japanese archaeological achievements and
the reasons for their sterility. (54)
Bolian, Charles (New Hampshire) THE ROLE OF THE UNIVERSITY ARCHAEOLOGIST.
Bolian is currently helping to develop a comprehensive survey of the State of New
Hampshire as a land planning tool for the preservation of archaeological sites and to insure
compliance with federal project requirements. He is also involved in undertaking federally
funded contracts for survey and excavation and research projects. Bolian will discuss the
New Hampshire program in light of the advantages and disadvantages of having a consortium
of professional archaeologists serve as advisors to a State Historic Preservation Officer,
rather than having a State Archaeologist who acts as the coordinator of these endeavors, and
the effects of this on developing a viable Department of Anthropology and conducting
on-going research into the archaeology of the State of New Hampshire. (18)
Bonnichsen, Robson (Maine-Orono) BONE PRETREATMENT. Bone pretreatment refers to
processing techniques used to alter the natural structure of antler and bone. Although
ethnographic evidence documenting this procedure Is rare, there Is widespread inferential
evidence in the archaeological record suggesting that it was commonly employed by
prehistoric craftsmen. Experimental data outlining how several pretreatment techniques
affect osseous materials is discussed. Subsequently bone and antler replicative experiments
are reported with the goal of evaluating how bone pretreatment influences concepts in bone
technology. (13)
Boone, Elizabeth Hill (Texas-Austin) THE LOST SIXTEENTH CENTURY SOURCE OF
HERRERA'S TITLE PAGE VIGNETTES. The source for the title page vignettes in Antonio
de Herrera’s Historia General which depict deities and ceremonies is a now lost pictorial
manuscript from central Mexico. Similarities between the vignettes and the Codex
Magliabechiano also show that Herrera’s prototype was a codex of the Magliabechiano
group. Entries pertaining to this document can be identified in three Spanish bibliographies;
these suggest that the manuscript was titled “Libro de Figuras" and indicate that it
contained extensive ethnographic information on the Mexica. An eighteenth century copy
of the manuscript has recently been found to exist in Madrid, which makés a partial and
tentative description of the Libro de Figuras possible. (34)

from Lower Austria are utilized in an investigation of the variability between a group of
sites that have been termed ‘‘Aurignacian."” Although partial reporting of lithic materials
from some of the sites suggests that the Aurignacian of the area is no more than a temporal
designation, the multivariate analysis of more complete collections and classes of data other
than the tools themselves suggests that this is not the case. (7)

Braun, David (Michigan) CERAMIC STYLE VARIABILITY DU RING THE MIDDLE-LATE
WOODLAND TRADITION IN WESTERN ILLINOIS. Characterizations of the Middle
Woodland-early Late Woodland transition in western Illinois as a period of social
fragmentation often cite as evidence a widespread decline in ceramic design complexity.
This paper briefly reviews the assumptions under which social meaning can be assigned to
observed changes in design complexity in tribal societies, and presents a modified version of
the Deetz-Leone-Whallon approach for application to ceramic data from groups of
proximate sites in the Illinois and Kaskaskia Valleys. Results of this application are found to
contradict previous characterizations of the social changes but not the stylistic changes, that
occurred during this period. (40)

Bronitsky, Gordon (Rutgers) MASS PRODUCTION AND COST REDUCTION. The late
prehistoric northern Rio Grande region of New Mexico was characterized by an increase in
population density and localization, and employment of measures of agricultural intensifica-
tion. During this period, groups attempted to maximize the number and diversity of energy
inputs into local systems. One concomitant of this increased interaction was a rise in
standardization resulting from mass production techniques, This standardization is measured
in terms of physical dimensions and the diversity of stylistic attributes, artifacts, and
materials of lithic assemblages from three sites. Results indicate differential specialization by
site in craft production and probable mass production of lithic cores during this period. (41)
Brose, David S. (Case Western Reserve) FORT WALTON SETTLEMENT PATTERNS. Fort
Walton first appears at about A.D. 1050 as a partial socio-ceremonia! pattern and stylistic
shift adopted by late Weeden Island populations. Little change in settlement-subsistence js
apparent. The late Fort Walton populations display a hierarchically organized, intensive
agricultural Mississippian polity with the introduction of Southern Cult socio-ceremonial
stratification at one of the large multi-mound temple towns in the Tallahassee Red Hills. In
the Appalachicola River Valley, late Fort Walton displays a less tightly integrated series of
uniformly spaced and paired, moderate-size, single mound riverine ceremonial towns, and a
number of smaller campsites along rivers and in interfluvial locations. Along the northwest
Gulf Coast a few widely spaced and isolated single mound ceremonial sites and large, nearly
egalitarian cemeteries serve a low density population scattered in small mixed economy
seasonal sites along the coastal-interior ecotone. These diverse late Fort Walton settlement-
subsistence patterns are reflected in early historic reports of the region. (25)
Browman, David L. (Washington) ENTREPRENEURS AND TIWANAKU ECONOMIC
SPHERES OF INFLUENCE, Caravan trade as an economic specialization important to the
maintenance of the urban center of Tiwanaku is discussed with special reference to the
organization of this trade, the commodities involved, and the resulting influences on
cultures not under the political hegemony of Tiwanaku. Certain classes of commodities,
28
, such as hallucinogens and pharmaceuticals, stimulated entrepreneurial activity beyond their
relative economic importance, and it is this activity which in part gives Tiwanaku such a
different configuration from its sister imperial city of Wari in Peru. (49)
Brown, James A. (Northwestern) CADDOAN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE
ARKANSAS RIVER DRAINAGE. Caddoan settlement patterns in the Arkansas River
drainage record a Mississippian settlement organization sustained by the productivity of
bottomland resources and corn agriculture in a transition between the prairie and forest at
the western border of the southeast. The location of base camp sites on the western front of
this region appears to be governed by the distribution of southeastern bottomland forest of
relatively high productivity. The sizé and complexity of sites range from medium-sized
mound centers to small villages, farmsteads, and special use sites. The structure of
settlement patterning conforms to Mississippian systems found to the east although the scale
of settlement hierarchy is reduced compared to systems in the Mississippi Valley. (25)
Brown, K. M. (Texas Archeological Survey) MIDDLE ARCHAIC CAMPS AT THREE MILE
DRAW. Hearth of firecracked limestone in linear clusters flanking major arroyos
(or in some cases, the escarpment separating recent floodplain remnants from the first
’ terrace) are the earliest (Middle Archaic). There is substantial evidence of occupation in the
mesquite/creosote scrubland habitat of the valley floors in the rugged canyonlands of
southwestern Terrell County. Within major clusters, hearths tend to occur single or in
multiples of two. Recent research has included mapping (including controls for differential
exposure by sheetwashing). (35)
Bruhns, Karen Olsen (San Francisco State) ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS AT
CIHUATAN, EL SALVADOR. Current archaeological investigations at Cihuatan, a
supposedly single component Postclassic ceremonial center in eastern El Salvador are
revealing earlier periods of occupation, of a substantial nature, at the site. In addition, an
apparently different sort of settlement pattern than that usually assumed is evident. These
new data indicate that revisions in the interpretation of the Cuscatlan border area and the
entire Pipil question are in order. (28)
Bryant, Vaughn M., Jr. (Texas A&M) PALYWNOLOGICAL RECORDS FROM HINDS CAVE.
Fossil pollen recovered from soil deposits in Hinds Cave located in the Lower Pecos area of
southwest Texas are used to infer aspects concerning the paleoenvironment and prehistoric
cultures in that region. Pollen records for Hinds Cave span an 8 ,000-year period and provide
data which can be correlated with other pollen records from nearby locales such as the
Devil's Mouth Site and Bonfire Shelter. In addition, the recovery of certain types of
economic pollen in the cultural deposits of Hinds Cave suggests the utilization of native
plants as dietary foods. (35)
Burger, Richard (California-Berkeley) THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC BASIS OF CHAVIN. An
archaeological study of habitation sites in the vicinity of Chavin de Huantar and at site
97-76 yields a three-phase occupation sequence for the late |P-early EH: a newly discovered
Wnabarriu phase, and two later phases corresponding to Ofrendas and Rocas. Indications are
that a large town surrounded the Chavin temples during Phase D. This large settlement was
located on the west side of the Rio Mosna while small contemporaneous villages were
occupied at the upper limits of the agricultural zone. The Unabarriu ceramics have intriguing
relationships with ceramic styles from the North and Central Sierra and the Central Coast,
which bear directly on a tentative hypothesis for the origin of Chavin. (39)
Burgess, Tony L. (Texas Tech) A RECONSTRUCTION OF THE VEGETATION OF THE
BRANTLEY RESERVOIR AREA PRIOR TO ANGLO-AMERICAN SETTLEMENT. The
major plant associations currently present in the area and their relationship to topography
and soil are described. Historical sources indicate that Anglo-American settlement induced
vegetational changes resulting from the introduction of exotic plant species and increased
grazing, erosion, and water utilization. The probable effects these changes had on the
distribution and relative abundance of dominant species are derived from historical data and
comparisons with extant stands. In general, species characteristic of the more xeric desert
shrub communities appear to have increased, and the grassland species have become more
restricted in occurrence. A reconstruction of the predominant plant communities of the area
before the introduction of domestic cattle about 13870 is presented. (27)
Butzer, Karl W. (Chicago) CHANGING HOLOCENE ENVIRONMENTS AT THE KOSTER
SITE: THE GEOMORPHOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE. Koster is situated in a minor
tributary valley of the Illinois River. INlinoian and Wisconsinan deposits preserved under and
adjacent to the site include proglacial silts, outwash terraces (‘‘sand ridges’), till, cryoclastic
slope screes, multiple loesses, dunes, and several paleosols. Accumulation of reworked loess
in an over-deepened valley began at Koster shortly after 10,000 B.P., and continued through
Holocene times, with major sedimentary breaks. The floodplain began to stabilize ca. 5000
B.P., after rapid aggradation, but remained a dynamic environment that developed its
present patterns after 2500 B.P. Hillside vegetation was considerably more xeric A.D.
750-1000, 2100-1900 B.P., and ca. 9700-500 B.P., with hillside woodland reduced to hill
prairie or parkland ca. 8500-7700 B.P. These dramatic Holocene environmental changes
enhance understanding of the Midwestern biomes, and show that interpretative archaeolog-
ical models for cultural adaptations through time must consider the environment as a critical
variable, rather than as a constant. (5)

PATTERNS IN PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST ECUADOR. The purpose of this study is to
determine certain subsistence practices and related human behavioral patterns for
prehistoric inhabitants of southwest Ecuador. This is accomplished by analyzing the
vertebrate, faunal remains. A total of 15 samples is considered, including three pre-Valdivia,
eight Valdivia, and four post-Valdivia sites (ca. 5000 B.C.-4.D. 1400). Based on these
analyses, questions concerning protein scarcity and protein acquisition, changes in protein
exploitation and subsistence orientation, hunting and fishing methods, and human
behavioral patterns for the various groups are considered. (30)

HAVANA TRADITION SITES. This paper is an initial exploration of Havana Tradition
settlement systems. Intersite variability between two sequent sites in the central Illinois
Valley, Dickson Camp and Pond, is examined. The assemblages are classified and then
compared according to functional categories, with special attention being paid to the
subsequent functions of reworked artifacts. A consistent pattern of variation, evident
through a series of analyses, suggests that Dickson Camp was a bluff-crest, multiple activity,
late summer/early fall, base camp with hide working a dominant activity, while Pond was a
bluff-base, highly specialized, work camp with lightweight cutting tasks dominant. (17)

by experimental replication and empirical multivariate analysis. The paper reviews the
research design and substantive results of an experiment involving the replication of
Preclassic Mesoamerican obsidian blades. Discriminating morphological variables between
percussion and pressure blades were identified through the use of discriminant function
analysis and principal components analysis. The theoretical and methodological value of the
analytic method, or method of controlled experiment, in lithic replication study Is
emphasized. (14)
Chapman, Jefferson (Tennessee) EARLY ARCHAIC PERIOD RESEARCH IN THE
LOWER LITTLE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY: RETROSPECT 1977. Archaeological
investigations over the past four years have located and tested over 20 deeply buried,
stratified Early Archaic period sites situated on the first terraces of the Little Tennessee
River in eastern Tennessee. Thousands of artifacts, features, abundant paleobotanical
remains, radiocarbon assays, and archaeomagnetic determinations have provided consider-
able insight into the Kirk and bifurcate traditions. With the current inundation of the river
valley and cessation of fieldwork, an overview and summary of the results to date seem
appropriate. (53)
Chartkoff, Joseph L. (Michigan State) TIME AND SETTLEMENT AT PETRIOLO DURING
THE WURM. Survey, surface collection, and excavation data from the valley of the Farma,
south of Siena, Italy, provide evidence for a series of Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic
occupations during the last glaciation. The data suggest that Upper Paleolithic settlers were
like their Mousterian predecessors in utilizing a series of stream terraces for occupation, but
that Upper Paleolithic settlement was both much denser and showed greater diversity of
terrain choice. The sites, 80-90 km inland but only 150-250 m above sea level, do not
correspond to Barker's model of Mousterian coastal occupation and Upper Paleolithic
transhumant settlement of the coast and highlands. Radmilli's recently published compen-
dium of prehistoric Italian sites provides grounds for suggesting thet, during the Wurm,
interior Italy was exploited by both Mousterians and Upper Paleolithic hunter-gatherers
primarily during interstadial phases. During stadia] maxima, occupation would be
concentrated along the present coast and on what are now submerged coastal plains. Data
relating to the validity of the hypothesis are considered. (7)
Chomko, Stephen A. (Missouri-Columbia) NEW EVIDENCE FOR CULTIGENS IN LATE
ARCHAIC ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES. Two cultigens, squash and sunflower, have
recently been recovered from three Late Archaic sites: Phillips Spring (southwestern
Missouri); and the Carlston Annis and Bowles Sites (western Kentucky). The new data add
supportive evidence to validate previously reported cultivars in preceramic contexts from
sites in the eastern United States. At present it appears that squash (Cucurbita pepo) was
introduced into eastern North America by 4000 B.P. while the earliest possible date on
sunflower (Helianthus annuus) as a native domesticate is at least 500 years later. Although
the route of introduction of tropical cultigens remains unclear, the presence of squash
indicates that the development of an eastern horticultural complex was influenced by early
developments in Mesoamerica. (6)
Christenson, Andrew L. (UCLA) EFFICIENCY, MAXIMIZATION, AND POPULATION
PRESSURE: SOME NEW LIGHT ON OLD CONCEPTS. Subsistence efficiency is defined as
the ratio of calories consumed (output) to calories expended in subsistence effort (input).
For any given population density, subsistence efficiency is maximized by minimizing labor
input. A marginal cost model is presented showing that for groups exploiting natural plant
and animal communities, subsistence effort must increase and subsistence diversity must
30
, increase as population density increases. Increasing subsistence diversity is an indication of
declining subsistence efficiency (“population pressure") rather than increasing subsistence
efficiency as usually assumed. Subsistence efficiency must be an important variable in any
model of human subsistence behavior. (37)

ical context of Grasshopper contains an abundance of artifacts in direct association with
occupational surfaces. This situation provides a Unique opportunity for the use of spatial
and quantitative analytic techniques in the reconstruction of activities. These investigations
suggest an activity organization at Grasshopper that departs from the model of Puebloan
domestic organization employed in archaeological literature. In addition, evidence from
superimposed floors suggests that the use of activity spaces changed in line with the growth
of the pueblo. (51)

length of occupation. Several formulas are employed and the variables uselife, systemic
number, and frequency of discard are discussed and quantified with relation to several
archaeological sites: Millie's Camp, Badger House, and Staro Selo, Yugoslavia. The ceramic,
quern, and flint tools are utilized in deriving the occupancy span of House 1 at Staro Selo.

Cliff, Maynard B. (SMU) LATE PRECLASSIC BURIAL PATTERNING AT THE SITE OF
CERRO MAYA, NORTHERN BELIZE: PRELIMINARY RESULTS. Burial data from the
late Preclassic period in the Maya Lowlands have usually been either ignored, or assumed to
follow Early Classic patterns for purposes of comparative diachronic analysis. This is
primarily because of the small sample sizes that have been recovered from Late Preclassic
contexts In the past. The site of Cerro Maya (or Cerros) in the Corozal District of northern
Belize is at present unique in having yielded a relatively large sample of Late Preclassic Maya
burials. The burials occur in distinct and easily recognizable clusters within a primary
midden deposit. This deposit underlies the main plaza of the ceremonial precinct, and
contains Chicanel ceramics and plaster floors. Preliminary analysis of these data seems to
indicate that the burials were deposited throughout the Late Preclassic period, in association
with “household clusters," occurring in a nucleated pattern surrounding the early
ceremonial precinct. Indications of change through time in terms of body treatment and
mortuary furniture also seem to reveal a pattern of increasing status differentiation and
increasingly standardized ceremonialism in regard to funerary practices throughout the Late
Preclassic period. (47)
Cobean, Robert H. (Harvard) THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE TULA REGION. Our
chronological framework for the Tula region is provisional and largely based on ceramic
stratigraphy and settlement pattern data. Only three reliable radiocarbon dates (all from
Tula’s Early Postclassic) are available for the entire region, but other C-14 and
archaeomagnetic dates will be available soon. Culturally, the region appears to have had
close ties with the Basin of Mexico throughout prehistory. The earliest occupations are Late
Formative. Terminal Formative occupations appear to have ceramic complexes similar to
complexes at Teotihuacan. In the Early Classic or slightly later, some sites in the southern
periphery were settled by people from Oaxaca or with strong Oaxacan ties who made
pottery much like that of Teotihuacan’s Oaxaca barrio. Throughout the Early Classic, there
appears to have been continuous occupation, but the ceramic complexes differ more from
the coeval complexes in the Basin than previously. However, many “pure Teotihuacan”
pottery types are associated with local Classic types, and at least one large Classic site
appears to have functioned as a provincial center for Teotihuacan. In the Tula region, there
may have been a massive depopulation after Teotihuacan’s collapse. During Tula’s apogee as
a major Early Postclassic city, orange pottery is the most common and diagnostic type,
resembling the Aztec. Extensive depopulation may have occurred during Aztec III times
after Tula's fall. Aztec ceramic complexes from Aztec II] onward are essentially identical to
those of the Basin. (2)
Collins, Alana Cordy (San Diego Mesa) HALLUCINOGENS AND SYMBOLIC INTEGRA-
TION IN THE CHAVIN CIVILIZATION. Hallucinogenic substances have played a pervasive
role in the religious orientation of many New World civilizations, including those of ancient
Peru. The role of hallucinogenic substances in the religion of the civilization of Chavin, the
first major civilization of Peru, is discussed. The uses of iconography, comparative
31

backward projection of ethnographic analogy are discussed within the specific context of
Chavin and its symbolic integration. (39)
Cooke, Richard G. (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) THE EXPLOITATION OF
ANIMAL RESOURCES ALONG THE PACIFIC LITTORAL OF CENTRAL PANAMA.
Though traditional faunal analysis attempts to reconstruct, by extrapolation and com-
parison, components of biotic communities that were exploited archaeologically, samples
are often biased toward one group of organisms (frequently mammals or fish). This bias is
particularly prevalent in the tropics and is due to dietary strategies of the studied groups,
factors of conservation, and recovery techniques employed. From 1971 to 1975, a large
faunal sample was recovered from the agricultural village of Sitio Sierra, Cocle, Panama.
Though the mammalian sample lacks species, it could be due either to preferential hunting
or environmental modification. Reconstruction of the total contiguous or exploited
community is simplified by analysis of avian, reptilian, and anuran remains. The Sitio Sierra
sample is compared with those from neighboring sites and an attempt is made to document
the history of man’s exploitation of animal resources along the Pacific littoral of central
Panama and his effects on the communities that provided them. (28)
Cordell, Linda S. (New Mexico) LATE ANASAZI HUNTING: INFERENCES FROM THE
TIJERAS PUEBLO FAUNA. Analysis of faunal material from trash deposits from Tijeras
Pueblo, a fourteenth century Anasazi site in central New Mexico, indicates unexpected
patterning, given the site’s cultural and environmental context. Relative proportions of
hunted species represented indicate considerable energy expenditure for a community
supported by domestic crops. Consideration of butchering marks, rib fragment size,
underrepresented elements, and ages of animals present indicates heavy year-round
utilization of game. These data, when compared with ethnographic game-processing
strategies, local climate, and nutritional information, permit tentative isolation of specific
stress factors operating to encourage hunting that are amenable to further testing utilizing
independently derived paleoclimatic reconstructions. Detailed examination of faunal
remains from late Anasazi sites has rarely been undertaken. Paleoclimatic reconstructions
based on palynology and/or tree-ring studies are often difficult to interpret, though critical
to questions involving site abandonment. Therefore, using faunal analysis to generate
hypotheses about specific conditions under which certain hunting and processing strategies
would be employed by horticultural groups is productive. (41)

Middie Lempa Valley of central El Salvador has been conducted by the National Museum of
El Salvador, resulting in excavations at more than ten sites dating to Preclassic, Classic, and
Postclassic periods. Details of the recent findings will be presented, including the
architecture and settlement plan of several ceremonial centers, one of which is an annular
complex of platforms surrounding two central structures. Preliminary data on material
culture in Classic period contexts to be discussed show vigorous local development within a
broader sphere of regional interaction. A postulated occupational hiatus for the Early
Classic will be considered in light of reconnaissance and excavations. (36)
Crawford, Gary W. (North Carolina-Chapel Hill) STUDYING JOMON PALEO-
ETHNOBOTANY. An examination of the paleoethnobotany of northeastern Japan was
undertaken in order to resolve and derive questions related to Jomon and post-Jomon
adaptations. Methodological problems of intersite and intrasite comparisons of flotation
samples are discussed. Samples from the Early Jomon Hamanasuno site show patterns of
plant remains preservation and recovery that may have general significance for flotation
studies. In addition, preliminary data show that weed distributions within Japan and eastern
Asia were probably influenced by prehistoric human activity, and that the ‘primary forest
efficiency” of the Jomon is questionable. Examination of such subsistence data will
contribute to our understanding of the maintenance of socio-cultural systems over long
periods of time. (54)

excavated there and has yielded data generally lacking for this time period and site type.
Absence of certain artifacts characteristically associated with shell middens of this period in
the Southeast and intense shell concentrations at the Penitentiary Branch site caused
problems in the excavation and analysis of material. However, recovery of extensive faunal
and paleobotanical material, human skeletal material, and a lithic and bone tool assemblage
provides useful data for comparison with other Southeastern shell middens. (53)

includes shellfish (queen conch, clams, and crab) and fish (wrasse and rays). The small
quantity of deepwater fish remains suggests inshore fishing and trapping as primary hunting
techniques. Mammal remains indicate that rodents were present in significant quantities in
the diet. Statistical analysis techniques were employed to investigate temporal continuity
and discontinuity in faunal remains. (12)

Crumley, Carole L. (Missouri-Columbia) SPACE-TIME DIALECTICS: ASHORT HISTORY

years, what is termed regional or locational analysis has become an approach frequently
chosen by archaeologists. The history of the utilization in other disciplines (biology,
geography, economics) is much longer, although methodological rather than theoretical
considerations have dominated that literature. Close examination of both methodological
and theoretical aspects of locational analysis and its application to archaeological data adds
an important dimension to the study: The conscious introduction of the temporal variable
offers further insight into both culture change and the human use of space. (52)

Mound Bottom, located on an alluvial terrace of the Harpeth River, is in the transitional
zone between the Highland rim and the Nashville basin. The Harpeth River Valley is in the
Western Mesophytic Forest region which is interpreted as a transition between the Mixed
Mesophytic Forest Region to the east and the Oak-Hickory Forest region to the west.
Transitional Zones or ecotones are rich in biotic resources, many of which were important
food sources for the indigenous populations. (53)

identified. The most important of these concerns disagreement that developed concerning
the specific problem addressed by the SARG research design and by SARG members as they
applied that design in specific areas. A second major problem concerns the extent to which

, “‘comparable”’ data result from the use of ‘‘standardized” variables. Difficulties involving the
kinds of data collected, data collection techniques, and analytical techniques are also
considered. The implications of these problems for cooperative research efforts and for any
effort to synthesize the results of different research projects done by different investigators
are discussed. (10)

DeBoer, Warren R. (Queens, CUNY) THE WOMB AND THE TOMB: CONTRASTING
MODELS FOR UNDERSTANDING AMAZON PREHISTORY. The Amazon Basin has long
been an enigma and a source of speculation in which relatively few data are used to promote
extreme and vigorously defended paradigms. On the one hand, the ethnographic record and
selective appraisal of the agricultural potential and protein supply have been used to portray
Amazonia as a Cul-de-sac, always peripheral to mainstreams of cultural development in
Andean South America. Recent archaeological work and a more differentiated view of the
area’s environmental potential suggest a completely different picture in which Amazonia
figures prominently in agricultural origins and the rise of long- distance trade networks and
33
, stratified societies. These contrasting models are evaluated in terms of ethnographic,
linguistic, archaeological, and historical evidence for Panoan speakers of the Upper Amazon.
Both are found wanting, and a revisionist model is offered. (24)

its relation to burned rock middens in southwest Texas. (35)
Deutchman, Haree L. (S!U-Carbondale) THE USE OF DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS TO
INTERPRET CERAMIC DESIGN ELEMENT VARIABILITY. In an effort to examine
intraphase variability of ceramic assemblages from Toreva phase (A.D. 1075-1150) sites on
Black Mesa, Arizona, Tusayan White ware, from a surface survey, was analyzed. Painted
decoration of the pottery was described by means of an hierarchical system of design
attributes. One question posed was the extent of variability between sites in a restricted
region during a short occupation span. Linear discriminant analysis was applied to ceramic
assemblages from 17 sites. This multivariate statistical technique made it possible to describe
sites on the basis of similarity of ceramic assemblages. The potential of discriminant analysis
for archaeological problems has not been sufficiently recognized. This statistical method is
an easily implemented, easily interpreted, and robust method, as well as a useful descriptive
tool for development of identification keys for artifact assemblages. Results of this study
substantiate the capacity of discriminant analysis to highlight variability and interassemblage
differences. (40)

Donahue, Randolph E. (Michigan State) OPTICAL SCANNING FOR ARTIFACT AT-
TRIBUTE RECORDING AT PETRIOLO II. This paper describes a new approach to artifact
34
, attribute recording that has significant implications for analysis method and theory. It is
being tried for the first time with artifacts from the 1976 season at Petriolo II. The method
utilizes optical scanning of specially printed checklists, a little like the format of a
machine-graded multiple-choice test. A Hewlett-Packard optical scanner treats the checklist
as a matrix and plots checked boxes. The Hewlett-Packard 2500 computer transforms the
recorded data into language suitable for a CDC 6500 or other large computer and loads it on
tape. The recorded attributes can then be analyzed as desired. The method completely
avoids keypunching and therefore eliminates the largest source of analytical error. With
collections of more than 2,000 artifacts, the cost of optical scanning is lower than for
keypunching, and cost differences increase with collection size. Most important, the card
format for checklists allows for selection of more than one attribute within a class for an
artifact, while existing systems allow for only one choice per class. This approach allows for
much more realistic measurements of attribute occurrences on artifacts. (7)
Donaldson, Bruce R. (SUNY-Binghamton) LESSONS FROM THE WHITE MOUNTAIN
PLANNING UNIT: A SMALL-SAMPLE SURVEY DESIGN FOR LARGE AREAS.
Multidisciplinary evaluation of large-tract planning units on U.S. Forest Service land usually
involves the archaeologist in the assessment of the kinds, density, and distribution of
cultural resources. Since federal planning decisions, which usually focus on issues concerning
, noncultural resources, must be made in light of possible impacts on the prehistoric record,
the archaeologist (usually operating under several constraints) must provide valid input to
the decision-making process. A small-sample probabilistic survey is therefore required. This
paper presents an hierarchical, multistage sampling design that is suitable for planning unit
; purposes and that is theoretically sound and methodologically efficient; a method for rapid
evaluation of preliminary stage results is included. (50)
Dort, Wakefield, Jr. (Kansas) EARLY MAN AT OWL CAVE: GEOLOGY AND ARCHAE-
OLOGY OF THE WASDEN SITE, EASTERN SNAKE RIVER PLAIN, IDAHO. A growing
perspective on the paleoenvironment and cultural history of the Snake River plain in
southern Idaho, and, by extension, its reflection of regional and continental events of the
late Pleistocene-Holocene period has been the orientation of archaeological and geological
research at Owl Cave (10 Bv 30), the Wasden site, in southeastern Idaho. The special
depositional history of the large lava rockshelter has yielded a well-dated sequence of
occupations accompanied by faunal assemblages and sedimentary features, beginning with
initial use of the rockshelter by hunters of bison and mammoth utilizing fluted points and
bone tools ca. 12,500 B.P. Geologically, excavation in Owl Cave, one of three collapsed lava
tubes, exposed 5 m of laminated silts believed introduced by wind, but distributed by water,
mainly snowmelt. Bedding is interrupted by structureless wedges up to 50 cm long, and
general horizonality is deformed by interwedge contortions from wedge growth. The
wedges, descending from 8-10 distinct levels, indicate repeated climatic cyclicity through
6,000 years of late glacial to Altithermal time, a record apparently echoed by faunal
variation. During filling, a ramp of early roof-fall permitted access by Folsom to recent man
with elephant and bison remains. Ramp excavations in nearby Coyote Cave revealed
multiple paleosols. (45)

the most distinctive feature of Christaller’s model, the hexagonal lattice. Although the
hexagonal lattice arrangement is theoretically elegant, the assumptions on which the model
is based are rarely met and, furthermore, the hexagonal lattice has rarely been shown to
exist. The principal problems with archaeological applications of this model are generally
inadequate spatial and temporal bounding and failure to demonstrate that archaeological

and frequently with fenced enclosures, were excavated and analyzed. The farmsteads are
situated on artificially terraced hillsides remote from the monumental centers and were part
of a region-wide farming community. Structural details of the farm houses suggest that the
farmers were also highly skilled masons employed for the construction of monumental
buildings in the centers. (47)

have long been a point of contention between archaeologists in southern Africa. Fieldwork
conducted in Botswana in 1975-76 has resulted in the discovery of over 100 sites of these
periods along the shorelines of now-dry Lake Makgadikgadi; an analysis of the lithic artifacts
recovered indicates that differences in subsistence, specialization, and mobility in the last
100,000 years may be referrable to human responses to changes in climatic cyclicity. (20)
Eddy, Frank W. (Colorado-Boulder) AN APPLICATION OF THE WYOMING PROJECTILE
POINT CHRONOLOGY TO DATING OF AN EASTERN COLORADO FOOTHILLS SITE
SURVEY. Dating of aboriginal sites of the Two Forks Archaeologica! Project located along
the South Platte River in the foothills of eastern Colorado, was accomplished by four lines
of chronological evidence, of which projectile point styles was the most useful. Due to the
comparatively low number of points as well as little stratigraphic context, both relative and
absolute age limits for the Two Forks projectile tips were derived by form comparison from
outside the study district. Comparisons were made in two steps. The radiocarbon-dated
Wyoming projectile point horizons were extrapolated to the deeply stratified Magic
Mountain site near Golden, Colorado. Once the Magic Mountain relative point sequence had
been dated, results were extended to the Two Forks surface collections. It was concluded
that just over half the aboriginal sites at Two Forks spanned 7,000 years of occupation.
Further, dated projectile point horizons, coordinated with alluvial, pottery, and historic
artifact data, allowed subdivision of the Two Forks occupation into eight chronological
periods, from Early Archaic to historic Ute. (19)

, Eqgers, A. V. (Archaeological Impact Services) EVIDENCE OF EARLY MAN IN THE
WESTERN MOJAVE DESERT, CALIFORNIA. Excavations carried out in conjunction with
the construction of the Space Shuttle Transport Road on Edwards AFB, California, led to
the discovery of a site containing a Pinto Basin type assemblage in the Antelope Valley. The
site was the first of its kind to be discovered in the western Mojave desert. Subsurface
testing resulted in the recovery of Pinto Basin and Silver Lake type points in association
with large quantities of artifacts made of local rhyolite. An olivella bead and obsidian
artifacts were also associated. The latter artifact associations are indicative of the early
establishment of trading patterns presently documented for the late prehistoric sites in
southern California. It appears that this site represents the westernmost extension of the
Desert tradition yet discovered in the Los Angeles area. (45)

Eighmy, Jeffrey L. (Arizona) LOGISTIC TRENDS IN SOUTHWEST POPULATION
GROWTH. With the widespread influence of Ester Boserup's demonstration that subsistence
intensification is caused by population growth, the idea that population growth is
independent of subsistence strategies has also been widely adopted. However, to show that
subsistence intensification is caused by population growth is not a demonstration that
population growth is independent of subsistence strategies. Evidence presented here suggests

) that in a number of prehistoric Southwest cases population growth was not independent of
environmental-subsistence constraints. In 13 of 14 possible cases, tree-ring dates indicate
that population growth was density dependent and can be described by a logistic function
with an average r° of .97. (41)

Ekland, Carolyn (Texas-Austin) DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS OF FRAGMENTS FROM
LONG BONE DIAPHYSES. Analysis of faunal remains from archaeological and pale-

objective was to determine whether the method of fragmentation or the taxa could be
predicted from fragments using shape characteristics only. In this pilot study, we have been
able to use a small number of shape descriptors to make discriminations between fragments
chewed by dogs and fragments broken by humans, and between cow, sheep, and deer bones.
Thus, it may be possible that collections of bone fragments can be made to yield much more
information than they do at present. (13)

ANALYSIS AT CHIRIPA. During 1974-75, a joint Bolivian-U.S. project was undertaken at

the site of Chiripa, on the Altiplano of Bolivia (ca. 3800 meters above sea level). One major

goal of the investigation by the U.S. collaborators was to apply the flotation technique of

water separation for the recovery of botanical remains and small animal bone for the early
af
, “oremound"™ levels of the site, thought to date in the 1500-1000 B.C. period. Analysis of

discussed. (49)
Essenpreis, Patricla S. (Harvard) FORT ANCIENT SETTLEMENT: A CASE STUDY OF
RESPONSE AT A MISSISSIPPIAN-LATE WOODLAND INTERFACE. Fort Ancient
culture is the reintegration of a variety of influences from several different Mississippian
cultures by relatively independent and culturally distinct populations in the Ohio Valley.
The differential adoption of proposed items and ideas by specific groups as well as differing
nature and degree of interaction between such groups is responsible for the lack of specific
burial patterns and village layouts for the Fort Ancient culture. As the Fort Ancient culture
develops through the period from A.D. 1000 to A.D. 1700, the nature of external and
internal dynamics change, making spurious the search for a single cause of origin such as
invasion. A lack of understanding of chronological positioning of Fort Ancient sites and foci
leave the consideration of Fort Ancient development wide open for speculation that cannot
be substantiated by available data. However, such speculations can be formulated as testable
models, the value of which can be examined through consideration of specific phases (or
foci) such as the Anderson phase. Support for the variable impact of Middle Mississippian
groups, other Fort Ancient groups, and the local Late Woodland populations can be
demonstrated for this phase. (25)

Fish, Paul R. (Georgia) FROM DEBITAGE TO BEHAVIOR: EXPLORING THE
POTENTIAL. Debitage constitutes one of the least glamorous of artifact categories and a
most neglected one in the realm of cultural inference. To change this undeserved image, the
potential of debitage for the interpretation of behavioral patterns is discussed. In order to
illustrate the application of debitage analysis in a number of specific instances, data from
several Middle Paleolithic assemblages is cited. The locus of activities and selective processes
in tool use and manufacture in a single site are inferred from kinds and distributions of
debitage. Comparison of several cultural aspects between sites is also carried out on the basis
of debitage attributes. (3)

conferring a particular significance to these images. Some of these signs appear with
numerals indicating a calendrical context that may be related to similar representations In

Fowler, Melvin L. (Wisconsin-Milwaukee) CAHOKIA AND THE AMERICAN BOTTOMS:
SETTLEMENT ARCHAEOLOGY. Settlement surveys have been conducted within the
American Bottoms by several different institutions and research projects. These have been
general surveys concerned primarily with site identification and location and not with
defining site size and function. Various studies of the Cahokia site itself have been
conducted. Limited though these data may be, some statements concerning settlement
systems can be proposed for future testing. Cahokia was the major site of a stratified system
of communities. Besides Cahokia there were second line communities made up of sites with
several mounds and plazas located at strategic points in the valley. Below these were what
, may have been specialized productive communities and farmsteads. Some discussion of the
development of this settlement system will be presented. (25)

Fox, Daniel E. (Texas Tech) BUSINESS-LIKE ARCHAEOLOGY: THE POTENTIAL FOR
APPLICATION OF MANAGEMENT CONTROLS. With a continued increase in the volume
of contract archaeology and a trend toward “conservation archaeology” (an adaptive
response to a seemingly apparent need to make archaeology a publicly responsible
institution of the American free enterprise system), the corresponding legal and nationally
integrated nature of ‘“‘the business’ has attracted professional administrators who seek to
standardize qualifications for practitioners, as well as for techniques and terminology. In an
attempt to avoid the conflict of basic human values about whether or not individual
archaeologists should be managed, this paper considers the potential for application of
PERT (Program Evaluation and Review Technique) as a method of project analysis that
might be employed by different contracting institutions. In conclusion, a discussion of
potential benefits and problems inherent in the standardized application of management
controls is offered. (26)

problems otherwise left hanging. In turn, one can aid Native American groups in problems
such as those connected with recent land-claims cases; thus ethnoarchaeology may provide
practical aid, as well as elucidation of theoretical problems. For little known groups such as
the Seri, Tarahumara, Huichol, or Tepehuan in north Mexico, ethnoarchaeological studies
preserve knowledge of material culture that is essential to understanding of possible
prehistoric relationships of such cultures with the American Southwest and each other. The
rare ethnoarchaeology work in California and the Great Basin is essential for understanding
. the still little known cultural development in these areas. (32)
Frison, George (Wyoming) BONE BUTCHERING TOOLS IN PREHISTORIC BISON KILL
SITES. There is no doubt that bone tools were used in some aspects of butchering in bison
kill sites from Paleo-indian to historic times. Positive identification of these kinds of tools Is
often conjectural due to methods of tool manufacture, the kinds of evidence resulting from
use, and varying preservation of the bones in archaeological contexts. A special problem is
that chewing by carnivores can produce results that suggest human use. These are some
considerations that archaeologists must carefully consider before describing certain bones as
parts of butchering tool assemblages. (13)

COMMUNITIES IN NORTHERN WEST VIRGINIA—THE TEST OF A MODEL. A research
program concerned with the formulation and testing of archaeological models explaining the
development of sedentary nucleated towns is outlined. Implicit in the extant literature is a
growth model contending that town communities form by growth and population
expansion of smaller hamlet communities. The consequences of this model are empirically
tested and disproven by stylistic and functional analyses of surface survey data from West
Virginia displayed by the computer mapping technique SYMAP. The growth model is shown
to be ineffective, and a nucleation model contending that towns form through a
compaction-redistribution of a given population in marginal environments is suggested. (6)

hand and in the organization's understanding of computer technology on the other. Some of
the lessons concerning data management that have been learned in the course of the SARG

Galinat, Walton C. (Massachusetts) VALDIVIA MAIZE AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE. The
early (ca. 4000 B.C.) appearance of a domestically evolved race of maize named Kecello in
the coastal Ecuador site of San Pablo suggests earlier maize agriculture than generally
presumed from the older domestication sequence at Tehuacan, Mexico. Mexican material of
comparable age has less advanced kernels. Increases in kernel size involve polygenic
selections by man that are poorly adapted in nature. While the chronology for
archaeological maize indicates that the South American maize probably originated from a
primitive Mexican maize introduced by man, once it became geographically isolated from its
ancestral source, divergence was possible. The drift of a genetic capacity for kernel
enlargement found fulfillment along a pathway toward increased productivity in South
America because it was unfettered by teosinte introgression. Teosinte, the putative wild
ancestor of maize found in Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras, has a much thinner pericarp
than maize and much smaller kernels. Hybrids of teosinte and maize may have inviable
kernels because of the incongruous combination of genes for large kernels with genes for
thin pericarp. In Mexico, Kernel sizé remained relatively small; increased productivity was
achieved by increases in row number and ear length. (22)

interrelationship of these sites was modeled using ethnographic data on the settlement-

the morphological and functional models of sites. Tests of these models and their
reevaluation in light of recent studies on the reconstructed environment are presented. (27)

Precolumbian sites for the past two years. Landsat imagery provided an overall perspective
of ecological zones. Standard small to medium scale aerial photography, originally taken by
various agencies for purposes other than architectural research was searched for evidence of
architecture. More detailed photos of individual sites were taken from the helicopter. Precise
location of sites and causeways between them were plotted 0n 1/100,000 topographic maps.
Defensive walls surrounding several sites were noted. Information about both key centers
such as Uxmal, Izamal, Chichen Itza, and numerous smaller architectural complexes is being
compared in order to formulate definitive statements about community form and
settlement systems. (31)

, Gerstle, Andrea (Colorado-Boulder) TOOL MANUFACTURE AT SABANA GRANDE,
NICARAGUA. Chipped stone artifacts and debitage recovered from a single mound at the
site of Sabana Grande, Nicaragua, by Richard Magnus are analyzed with a view to
identifying patterns in tool manufacturing behavior. A behavioral model of tool manu-
facture is proposed on the basis of an initial intuitive classification of artifacts into core,
blank, preform, and tool categories. The proposed reduction sequence is then tested and
verified with statistical (principal components) analysis of a sample of complete unmodified
debitage flakes. The model is subsequently refined by analysis of additional flake
types—flake tools and resharpening flakes. The completed model is examined for
characteristics which may apply to distinguishing tool manufacture at Sabana Grande from
other areas. (3)

archaeological problems by providing direct historic models of resource utilization and
settlement patterns. On the level of general models of prehistoric hunter-gatherer behavior,
social organization, and ecology in tropical zones, ethnoarchaeological studies have
' substantially contributed to the refinement of such models. At yet another level of
generalization, these studies may be used to form and/or test general hypotheses regarding

Recent quantitative studies have indicated that although some artifacts were manufactured

made from indigenous source material. This paper reports on the quantitative analysis of a
number of copper artifacts from the Southeast and reviews the concept of southeastern
exchange in light of these findings. (53)
Goldstein, Lynne (Wisconsin-Milwaukee) CULTURAL PERIODS VS. CULTURAL SYS-
TEMS: DOES SHELL-TEMPERED POTTERY A MISSISSIPPIAN MAKE? Archaeologists
often assign sites to cultural periods on the basis of the presence of certain material items.
This approach can lead to difficulties because: (1) the absence of such items does not
necessarily imply that the site is of another period; (2) we are applying, in many cases,
simple monothetic definitions to complex polythetic situations; and, most importantly, (3)
we often fail to understand the differences between a cultural period and a cultural system.
Using Mississippian society as an example, it will be shown that while certain items may be
markers for the cultural perjod, they are not necessarily markers for Mississippian cultural
systems. |deas for clarifying these conceptual difficulties will be suggested. (29)

Grady, James (Colorado-Boulder) ANIMAL BEHAVIOR PATTERNS AS AN ECONOMIC
DETERMINANT OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE LOCATION. Large herbivorous herd
animals have traditionally made up the bulk of the protein intake of hunters and gatherers.
Understanding the movement of these animals, how and why they behave as they do, is an
essential step in clarifying the economic behavior of man. Hunting as a concept is
abandoned and the concept of overlapping behavioral systems, the man-animal relationship,
is substituted. The basic thesis is drawn from the behavior of mule deer (Odocoileus
hemionus hemionus) and site distribution in western Colorado. (5)

(ca. 7000 6.P.) was superimposed upon an increasingly xeric environment. This superimposi-
tion is indicated by numerous shifts in taxonomic abundance within the archaeofaunas. The
effects of these events upon humans are poorly known. The mid-Holocene disappearance of
pikas (Ochotona princeps) is explained by these events, and confirms the hypothesis that
the distribution of boreal mammals on mountainous islands within the Great Basin is
accounted for by initial Pleistocene colonization followed by extinctions of geographically
intermediate populations. (4)

PATTERNS FOUND IN SEIP MOUND 1, ROSS COUNTY, OHIO. Based on a methodolog-

detailed description of burial attributes for each individual of a burial population permits
identification of components of the social structure (defined as identifiable groups of
individuals) and interpretation of social! organization (defined as relationships within and
between components). Descriptive variables includé measures of tomb size and materials,
burial form, associated artifacts, age and sex when available, and relative location within the
burial population. Results of analysis of the burial population within Seip Mound 1 show
that the associated living population consisted of three ranked major divisions, with
differentiated subgroups within each. These major divisions are associated with contiguous,
but separable, physical space and differential distribution of specific sociotechnic items. An
hypothesized similar social structure is suggested for some, but not all, of the other
Hopewellian peoples of the local geographic area. (17)

site in eastern Colorado resulted in the observation of significant patterns of breakage due to
preparation and utilization of certain bone elements for tools. A systematic analysis of the

\ 41,000 bones and bone fragments produced several hundred bone tools. These tools were
identified by specific breakage patterns, polish, flake removal, and other evidence of
use-wear. The majority of these implements are long bones although ribs, mandibles, and

based on the specific elements, breakage patterns, and inferred utilization is presented.
Additionally, the distribution of bone tools in relation to unutilized faunal remains and
lithic implements is discussed in terms of activity areas. A better understanding of
Paleo-Indian bison butchering practices has resulted from the analysis of the Jones-Miller

Gunn, Joel D. (Texas-San Antonio) LINEAR DISTRIBUTION ANALYSIS. A whole
literature has evolved around the question of whether a given tool type is or is not clustered
on an occupation floor. Since comparison of distributions between tool types has been
based on impressions, methodologies have been only marginally involved with the pattern of
cultural debris on an occupation floor and what tool kits can be inferred from that pattern.
They might serve as significance tests once a pattern has been inferred but are not
appropriate numerical methodologies for generating hypotheses of relationships between
functional entities. This paper outlines a method for determining intertype distributions
based on linear models. The method is capable of discovering combinations of tool types
that can be considered possible tool kits and the locational patterns of those tool kits. (29)

additional groups have been measured from the lower Illinois River Valley and are compared
with three of the original five groups also from the same area. Phenotypic changes in the
magnitude of sexual dimorphism in size reflect the shifting patterns of subsistence
demonstrated in these archaeological populations. (44)

Hantman, Jeff (Arizona State) ANALYSIS OF CERAMIC DESIGN—AN EXAMPLE OF
MICRO-SERIATION. Southwestern archaeologists often order traditional ceramic types to
44
, obtain relative temporal control of data, i.e., seriation. There are two problems with
traditional seriation: (1) it produces a record of change with inadequately large temporal
levels of analysis; and (2) it is based on untested assumptions about rates of change and the
directionality of change. Finer temporal controls are necessary to produce an understanding
of behavioral change. Micro-seriation provides a method for achieving these controls.
Ceramics collected near Springerville, Arizona, provide the data base for application of this
method. Attributes measured are design elements and proportions. Similar sherds are
grouped using the H-Clus II cluster program, and discriminant analysis is done to determine
relevant attributes. Finally, sites are grouped by seriating relative occurrences of “‘clusters’’
at a site. Temporal ordering of groups and determination of rates of change will be tested
with collections from sites of known dates in east-central Arizona. (40)

currently available and on file. Holding agencies are identified and costs are discussed. Both
archaeological and technical limitations are identified. The second source, that of
contracting original imagery, is also described. Pertinent factors such as cost; types of
imagery, i.e., black and white, multi-spectral, color, false color IR, heat sensing, and radar;
seasonal limitations; climatic factors; sun angle; and the stipulations and restrictions
imposed by the host country on aerial reconnaissance flights are outlined. (23)
Harlan, Mark E. (New Mexico) EARLY AND MIDDLE FORMATIVE FIGURINES FROM
CHALCATZINGO, MORELOS, MEXICO. During the 1972, 1973, and 1974 field seasons of
the Chalcatzingo Project, approximately 5,000 fragments of Early and Middle Formative
figurines were excavated. This research report will present the following information about
those figurines: (1) the range of variability in the collection, (2) the chronological
placements of the types, and (3) the spatial distribution of the variability on the site. A brief
conclusion will be drawn concerning the meaning of patterned variability in the collection.

Harn, Alan D. (Dickson Mounds Museum) MISSISSIPPIAN SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN
THE CENTRAL ILLINOIS RIVER VALLEY. The spatial distribution of Mississippian sites
in the central Iilinois River Valley is examined and various social and environmental factors
influencing site locations are discussed. Data are presented to suggest that space utilization
and internal structuring can be studied at four distinct levels within the Spoon River
society: regional, community, individual site, and individual habitation. Site size and
proposed function are weighed against topographic setting, water resource, soil type,
vegetational context, and seasonality in an analysis of the Larson community, a post-A.D.
1200 Larson phase aggregation of some 40 sites. It is proposed that, while site distribution
Was nonrandom, it was influenced more by primary articulation with the natural
environment than by sociopolitical organization. (25)
Harrold, Francis B., Jr. (Chicago) A REAPPRAISAL OF THE CHATELPERRONIAN, The
Chatelperronian industrial tradition is the earliest manifestation of the Upper Paleolithic in
France and Cantabrian Spain. It embodies the transition from Middle to Upper Paleolithic,
which is felt by most Paleolithic archaeologists to involve not only a shift from flake to
blade predominance in stone tool assemblages, but changes in human lifeways and physical
types as well. & brief summary is given of the temporal range (about 35,000 to 32,000 years
ago) and environmental milieu implied by the paleoclimatic, radiometric, and faunal
evidence from Chatelpeérronian sites, and the implications of the scanty human skeletal
evidence. Results are presented of typological studies using statistical techniques to attack
two problems: (1) The typological dimensions of the Chatelperronian itself; and (2)
Detailed comparisons with two other traditions that, in current French theory, share a
continuity of cultural tradition with the Chatelperronian—the earlier Mousterian of
Acheulean tradition and the later Gravettian. The conclusions of the study are presented,
and discussed in terms of the place and meaning of the Chatelperronian, not only in the
French and Spanish sequences, but in the larger process of transition from Middle to Upper
Paleolithic. (7)
Hastorf, Christine (UCLA) RESOURCE UTILIZATION IN THE MIMBRES RIVER
VALLEY: A CATCHMENT ANALYSIS. An economic energy minimization model is
applied to the major resource yields, using site catchment analysis. Three site catchments are
determined, all from the same spatial locus within the valley but spanning a period from
4.D. 700 to 4.0. 1450. From these constructions, diachronic shifts in resource uses are
predicted. These predictions are then related to the sites’ archaeological data. Additional
hypotheses for interpreting the data, and a discussion of limitations of the model are given.

Hatch, James W. (Pennsylvania State) MEASURING THE EFFECTS OF SAMPLING
ERROR IN CERAMIC FREQUENCY SERIATION. The chronological ordering of ceramic
samples is commonly undertaken by employing frequency seriation. However, recent
theoretical articles concerning its use with ceramics suggest that the ordered sequence is
effected by a large number of social and technological variables. The specific values
associated with these variables clearly affect the chronological reliability of the resulting
sequence, yet their actual impact has rarely been explored. This paper will report on (1) a
45
, newly developed computer program (POTS) which dynamically simulates critical aspects of
the manufacture, breakage, and accumulation of sherds in a ceramic-using village whose data
parameters are known, and (2) the results and implications of applying standard seriation
techniques for a chronological ordering of these data. The theoretical implications of the
simulation as a research tool will be discussed, along with specific techniques of
operationalization and substantive research results. (15)
Haviser, Jay B. (Florida State) CERAMIC AND LITHIC TYPOLOGY FOR THE VIRGIN
ISLANDS NATIONAL PARK. An analysis of aboriginal ceramic and lithic materials
recovered from the Virgin Islands National Park and study of their relationships with
materials from Puerto Rico and the Lesser Antilles has allowed the formulation of
typologies for these artifacts. Quantitative analysis techniques were employed as the most
efficient methods of establishing these typologies due to the restricted geographic area
involved. Multivariate analysis methods were used on the lithic materials to synthesize the
archaeological evidence of the aboriginal inhabitants. (12)
Hay, Conran A. (Pennsylvania State) VARIABILITY IN WEAR PATTERNS ON OBSIDIAN
FLAKES. Examination of wear patterns on the edges of several obsidian blade fragments
from Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala, at the high magnifications possible with scanning electron
microscopy, revealed variations in the morphology of use-scratches that were not obvious
with optical techniques. On some edges, scratches consist of clean-cut grooves, whereas on
others they may resemble lines of micro-chatter markings. An experimental program was
initiated to investigate the cause of these differences, with the specific aim of determining
whether variations in use-scratch morphology could be profitably employed in functional
analysis. Fresh obsidian flakes were used to cut and scrape various materials, and the
resulting wear patterns were examined using both optical and scanning electron microscopy.
The results of these experiments, and their implications for functional analyses are reported.

Hayden, Brian (Simon Fraser) ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY IN AUSTRALIA: A REVIEW.
During the twentieth century, archaeologists’ relationship to Australian and New Guinean
ethnographic opportunities for understanding chipped stone hunter/gatherer technologies
has been characterized by intense avoidance. By mid-century, opportunities for observing
the full range of lithic manufacture, use, and context was seriously eroded, and it is dubious
if any individuals with full Knowledge in these areas will exist beyond the present decade.
Profitable work is still possible however on many ecologically and socially related aspects of
interest to archaeologists, including traditional use of sites and the environment, ritual
relationships to ecology, movement schedules, types of group boundaries, and residential
patterning. (24)
Hays, T.R. (North Texas State) A REEXAMINATION OF THE ARCHAIC-NEO-
AMERICAN TRANSITION IN NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS. Archaeological research on
prehistoric occupation of north-central Texas has increased as a result of projects sponsored
by various governmental agencies, including site surveys, testing, and excavation. This report
presents preliminary results of excavations at Northlake, a Late Archaic-Transitional site
located southeast of Coppell, Dallas County, Texas. Analysis of excavated material suggests
that a reexamination of Late Archaic to Neo-American cultural development in north-
central Texas may be necessary. Hypotheses of cultural Change were formulated and tested
using a variety of techniques. Cultural material found to be significant indicators of change
were lithic artifact raw materials, ceramics, ground stone, and worked bone. Results of the
research indicate the need to modify previous theories regarding the late Archaic-
Transitional stage (1) chronology, (2) subsistence patterns, and (3) cultural affiliations. (19)

the Trujilo-Aguan River Valley regions (Department of Colon), northeast Honduras, in
1975-76, has produced data on the Precolumbian settlement, subsistence, trade, and
technological patterns prevalent in the region and has begun to clarify the culture history of
this important frontier zone. Two sites, H-CN-5 :Selin, and H-CN-12:Rio Claro, dating to the

chronometric age determinations for the region are outlined. (36)
Henderson, John (Cornell) NO RTHWESTERN HONDURAS AND THE EASTERN MAYA
FRONTIER. Historical evidence indicates that, at the time of the Spanish conquest, Naco,
an important commercial center participating in an extensive exchange network, was near
the boundary between Maya and non-Maya speech. Recent survey and excavations in the
Valle de Naco confirm Naco’s Postclassic commercial importance and suggest that a
comparable situation prevailed during the Classic period. Long-distance exchange was an
important mechanism of communication within Mesoamerica and across its eastern frontier.
Traditional concepts such as the “port of trade" do not adequately reflect the complexity
of the interactions suggested by historical sources, and standard analytical techniques are
not well suited to detecting the subtle reflections of these interactions in archaeological
evidence. (36)

COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. Evaluation of ASCS aerial photographs revealed regular patterns
on the floodplain of the Rio de Arenas and Cameron Creek drainages in Grant County, New
Mexico. Subsequent ground reconnaissance and photography using panchromatic, black and
white, infrared, and color infrared film defined an irrigation canal system and the presence
of irrigated plots on the flood plain. A series of check dams on adjacent slopes were
discovered solely using color infrared imagery. The agricultural system is probably
associated with the Mimbres phase of the Mogollon. (31)
Hester, James J. (Colorado-Boulder) AERIAL PHOTO INTERPRETATION OF THE
COPAN CEREMONIAL CENTER. Aerial photo reconnaissance flights over the ceremonial
center of Copan, Honduras, in May 1976, have revealed the following: (1) individual
buildings less than one meter high could be located and identified under forest canopy,
adding 50 ummapped mounds and doubling the size of the ceremonial center; (2) course of
the Sacbe originally mapped by the Carnegie Institution can be traced across plowed fields
and through the central plaza, changing our view of the plaza’s geographic orientation; (3)
mapping of soil color changes, using color IR imagery, offers the possibility of
reconstruction of portions of the central acropolis eroded by the Rio Copan. This
preliminary use of aerial photography at Copan indicates that its utility in Mesoamerica is
greater than previously realized. (23)
Hester, Thomas R. (Texas-San Antonio) RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL STUDIES AT
BAKER CAVE, VAL VERDE COUNTY, TEXAS. During summer 1976 a field party from
the University of Texas at San Antonio conducted additional archaeological research at
Baker Cave, a stratified rockshelter in Val Verde County, Texas. Earlier work at the site by
James H. Word (Floydada, Texas) had revealed the presence of a late Paleo-Indian
occupation (the Golondrina horizon of ca. 7000 B.C.) at the base of the shelter deposits. As
a result of the 1976 investigations, new information was obtained on this early occupation,
particularly in the areas of technology, subsistence, and local environment. Of significance
was the discovery of a large hearth in the Golondrina stratum. The entire hearth fill (over
200 Ibs.) was removed ‘for laboratory processing. Constituents of the fill include an
abundance of fish bones, seeds, walnuts, and other materials significant to studies of late
Pleistocene subsistence and environment in the region. Also obtained through the 1976
research project was added information on the earliest Archaic utilization of the shelter. (35)

the University of Virginia over the last year and a half in the Shenandoah National Park have
focused on the entire range of human occupation and exploitation of the Blue Ridge area.
Financed by grants from the U.S. National Park Service, our research has revealed a
hitherto-unsuspected wealth of prehistoric sites in the park spanning 8,000 years and has led
to the discovery of the first well-stratified archaeological sites in the montane area. The
prehistoric survey has been complemented by an historically-oriented survey combining
the techniques of archaeology, demography, and history to investigate the early European

extensive ethnographic and archival research and the initial analysis of the impact of
isolation and later resettlement of montane communities. (6)
Hofling, Andrew (Washington) ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES AND THEIR DOMAINS
IN THE LATE CLASSIC. The study of architecture is one of the oldest foci of Maya
archaeology. However, recent hieroglyphic research, especially the dynastic and emblem
glyph studies have surpassed the level of variational architectural analyses both in the
specificity of features considered and in the explicitness of interareal relationships. The
present work is a general reconsideration of areal relationships during the Late Classic period
based on a formal distributional analysis of a large number of architectural features applied
to representative sites of the entire Maya area. It is designed to clarify the general picture of
architectural feature distribution and to specify complexes of traits shared interregionally.

Detailed analysis of the camelid remains has allowed a systematic reconstruction of a

small fauna has indicated that in contrast to the Ayachucho pattern, guinea pigs and other
small mammals played an insignificant part in the nutritional picture. But utilization of
lacustrine resources, including various avifauna as well as the more obvious fish species, is
much more important than previously believed. (39)

Hurley, William M. (Toronto) EARLY JOMON (ca. 6000-3500 B.c.) VILLAGES IN
HOKKAIDO AND THE ORIGINS OF SEDENTISM IN NORTHERN JAPAN. Jomon Japan
has long been characterized as a cultural tradition of semipermanent camps and villages,
dependent upon a hunting and gathering economy, and not fully exploiting marine
resources until Middle Jomon times (ca. 4000-2500 B.C.). For Hokkaido, the Jomon
presence and character were considered marginal due to severe climate conditions. Recent
research in southwestern Hokkaido suggests that the roots of permanent, planned villages,
horticulture, and marine exploitation between 4100 B.C.+800 can be found in this northern
outpost of Jomon. Sedentary villages in Asia and the New World dating from this temporal
period suggest that our view of Formative cultures needs modification. (54)
Hurtado de Mendoza, Luis (Pennsylvania State) OBSIDIAN EXPLOITATION AND
SOCIAL STRUCTURE IN PRECOLUMBIAN GUATEMALA. It has been proposed that the
social organization of Kaminaljuyu was causally related to patterns of production and
consumption of obsidian tools. A neutron activation procedure was used to discriminate
among samples of obsidian collected from different extrusions of the major obsidian sources
in Guatemala. The data on extrusions were compared to debitage specimens from sites in
the valley of Guatemala, where three major sociopolitical units are thought to have
coexisted. Results reported here seem to validate extant hypotheses. They also facilitate
inferences regarding patterns of obsidian spatial distribution and their correlation with the
social organization of the region at different phases. They are examined in detail for the |
Late Terminal Formative (A.D. 1-200). (3) |

article (American Scientist 64 :316-327), R.S. MacMNeish discussed the early prehistory of
the New World in terms of four stages, and cited, as characteristic tools for the first three of
the stages, the bifacial choppers and flake scrapers, specialized unifacial tools, and bifacial
leaf-shaped projectile points, respectively. It is likely that the three categories of tools cited
by MacNeish do belong to three separate technological traditions in Pleistocene Japan. The
paper attempts to delineate spatial and temporal distributions of these traditions within
Japan and in northeast Asia during the Upper Pleistocene. (54)

Jacobsen, Thomas W. (Indiana) OBSERVATIONS ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF PLANT
AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY IN SOUTHERN GREECE. This paper will briefly discuss the
present evidence related to the problem of the development of an economy based largely
upon subsistence agriculture in southern Greece, with special attention given to the
important new findings from Franchthi Cave in the Greek Argolid. The major question to be
considered is: are the origins of agriculture in southern Greece the result of a process of
diffusion from the better known areas of the Middle East, or are they the result of local
experimentation that began as early as the late Pleistocene? The evidence from the
Franchthi excavations promises to be of great value in deciding this issue because of the
site's long stratigraphic sequence that encompasses the critical block of time from ca.
25,000 to ca. 5,000 years ago. The results will also have significant implications for our
understanding of the origins of agriculture in Greece as a whole as well as in the neighboring
areas of temperate Europe and the Near East. (16)

THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL ANALYSIS OF LITHIC DEBITAGE. Archaeological

location of 56 prehistoric sites. Lithic debitage constitutes the largest single category of
artifacts recovered from these sites. The technological attributes of debitage collected are
analyzed using several types of multivariate statistical techniques in an attempt to discern
nonrandom patterns of variability. Hypotheses concerning variation in site activity as
reflected by technological variability of debitage, physiographic variability of site location,
and distance of the site from lithic resources will be examined. (3)
Jelinek, Arthur J. (Arizona) SOME USES OF DEBITAGE IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL
ANALYSIS. Debitage, here defined as complete and fragmentary unretouched flakes and
cores, can contribute to the interpretation of archaeological remains in several ways. Three
of these are treated here in the context of a single deeply stratified Paleolithic site (et
Tabun): (1) the consistent features of shape of some elements of debitage in relation to the
forces contributing to the final position of the material in archaeological deposits can yield
helpful information bearing on disturbance and attitude of old surfaces; (2) ratios of
particular elements of debitage and debitage/tool ratios can furnish evidence of manufacture
and utilization of lithic materials; (3) ratios of metric dimensions of flakes can be used to
interpret major differences and trends in technological traditions. (3)
Jeter, Marvin D. (Arizona State) PREHISTORIC PROCESSES IN THE PRESCOTT
REGION, WEST-CENTRAL ARIZONA, Investigations in Copper Basin, southwest of
Prescott, represent the first comprehensive study of a “Prescott Branch" settlement-
subsistence system. Sites include small groups of one-room structures overlooking
agricultural lands, gathering-hunting loci in a variety of chaparral communities, and small
hilltop enclosures. Climatic conditions ca. A.D. 900-1100 permitted a continuum of
semipermanent to temporary field houses, associated with various sojl situations in Copper
Basin and at previously investigated sites in this agriculturally marginal region. Climatic
deterioration apparently precipitated population aggregation in better agricultural situa-
tions, and may have also given rise to the essentially non-agricultural Yavapai system. (51)
Jochim, Michael A. (California-Santa Barbara) ECONOMIC STRATEGIES IN THE UPPER
RHINE MESOLITHIC. A general model of economic decision-making among hunter-
gatherers has been developed that can generate predictions about the distribution of
archaeological materials. Application of this model to the Mesolithic of the south German
Danube Valley suggested functional interrelationships among known sites. The model is now
applied to the same time period of an adjacent portion of the upper Rhine which, unlike the
Danube, possessed great runs of salmon in historic times. Unfortunately, Mesolithic material
of this region includes no salmon remains, and the prehistoric presence of this resource
cannot be assumed, dué to great changes in the coastliné and lower Rhine. Investigation of
the Mesolithic economy is approached by constructing various forms of the model, each
incorporating different assumptions regarding the presence or absence of salmon, efficiency
of harvesting technology, and the practice of storage techniques. The resulting sets of
predictions, differing in terms of site distribution and characteristics, are compared with the
archaeological record, and suggestions are offered about the Mesolithic economy of this
region. The value of such theoretical tools is stressed. (46)
Johnson, Eileen (Texas Tech) PALEO-INDIAN BONE EXPEDIENCY TOOLS—LUBBOCK
LAKE AND BONFIRE SHELTER. Bone butchering tools, particularly in Paleo-Indian
49
, localities, have only recently been recognized and described as assemblages. These
butchering tools are referred to as expediency tools because they were made at the site from
bones of bison carcasses being processed and then left with the rest of the faunal debris
when the locality was abandoned. Bison kills at the Lubbock Lake site were small, with only
a few bison killed and processed at any one time. Expediency tools have been recovered
from both Folsom and Plainview bison kill/butchering locales. Bonfire Shelter is a bison
mega-kill locality, with three kills spanning the Folsom and Plainview periods. Although not
previously reported, several expediency tools have been recognized during a recent
reanalysis of the material. Both sites are on the Southern Plains, and the assemblages from
the two localities are described and compared. (13)

principal Itza Maya settlement of the protohistoric and Colonial periods, at Topoxte in Lake
Yaxha, Peten, Guatemala. This review of sixteenth and seventeenth century ethnohistorical
sources concludes that Tayasal could not have been in Lake Yaxha, and that it was almost
certainly on the island of Flores in Lake Peten. The locations of other Itza settlements as
well as settlements of additional Itza-dominated groups in the Lake Peten region are also
discussed. A tentative model of Lake Peten Maya settlement patterns is presented as part of
a larger ongoing ethnohistorical study. (34)

this symposium, we describe the “‘direct ethnological" method, comparing it to ethno-
archaeology, as used by Bonnichsen, and to ethnohistorical investigations. The potential use
of the “dijrect ethnological" method, as well as of ethnoarchaeology narrowly defined, in
the eastern half of Anglo-America will be suggested, and caveats mentioned. (32)

Keller, Don (Museum of Northern Arizona) THE TOLCHACO COMPLEX IN THE LIGHT
OF DEBITAGE ANALYSIS. Analysis of lithic material from extensive Pleistocene
gravel-terrace quarry sites in northeastern Arizona has provided a basis for describing certain
aspects of lithic procurement and use. The study is based on a comparison of expected
versus observed frequencies of various artifact classes. Expected frequency values were
obtained through replicative experiments. Data generated by this study are further applied
toward a redefinition of the so-called Tolchaco complex. The hypothesis is advanced that
this complex represents limited function, including quarry/workshop activity, rather than
remains of an archaeological culture. (3)

Kennedy, Nedenia C. (Illinois-Urbana) ON THE FRONTIER AT PLAYA DE LOS
MUERTOS, HONDURAS. Previous appraisals of Formative period occupations at Playa de
los Muertos, Honduras, have dwelt upon the more “exotic” ceramics found there; and their
similarity to Formative wares from such sites at Tlatilco and Tlapacoya in Central Mexico.
New investigations reveal, however, that the artifactual complex of Playa de los Muertos in
its entirety is more significantly related to Formative period complexes within southern
Mesoamerica and Central America. In this presentation | shall review several lines of
evidence to this effect and discuss their implications as regards long-distance contacts,
definition of a southern periphery, and the rise of civilization in Mesoamerica. (36)

Klein, Joel 1. (NYS Office of Parks and Recreation) THE SHPO, FEDERAL AGENCIES,
AND THE CONTRACT ARCHAEOLOGIST: A CAUTIOUS MENAGE. To date, only a
handful of federal agencies have established regulations regarding the identification of
cultural resources. This has placed the various State Historic Preservation Officers, whose
role is strictly defined as advisory and consultative, in the often uncomfortable position of
(a) reminding federal agencies of their responsibilities toward historic and archaeological
sites, and (b) often acting as staff archaeologist for these same agencies. In New York State,
the result has been the adoption of a procedure by the NYSHPO and Region || of the
Environmental Protection Agency, which is designed to ensure proper historic preservation
compliance. This paper will use case studies to review the basics of this procedure and show
how it has affected archaeologists engaged in cultural resource studies for Pure Waters
projects in New York. (26)

Kleiner, Sally Jane (Eastern New Mexico) ORNAMENTS AT SALMON RUINS, SAN JUAN
COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. The ornaments at Salmon Ruins are a population of artifacts
that are considered to have functioned outside the life support system of the pueblo. The
assumption is made that the function they served was aesthetic, social, and/or ritual. Objects
included in this study are: (1) items of adornment and decoration; (2) coloring stones and
pigment; (3) non-indigenous materials; and (4) effigies, small statuary, and carvings. Tools
used to manufacture ornaments and produce pigments are also considered. The research
design established to study ornaments has several objectives: (1) the identification of
materials used to manufacture ornaments and possible sources of these materials; (Il) the
classification of ornaments by categories based on morphology and inferred use or function;
(11) the distribution of ornaments within the pueblo; and (IV) comparison of ornaments
from Salmon with those from other contemporaneously occupied pueblos. (41)

Klesert, Tony (SIU-Carbondale) ANALYSIS OF INTRASITE CERAMIC DESIGN
VARIABILITY. A quantitative method of describing ceramics, based upon painted design
attributes, is devised and applied to the analysis of temporal variability. In the test case, the
ceramics are the population of sherds from a single Pueblo | Anasazi site on Black Mesa,
northeastern Arizona. The site is highly heterogeneous architecturally and temporally; but
the ceramics, using traditional typology, are entirely homogeneous. The design attributes
are manipulated by discriminant analysis, and while the heterogeneity between groups is
small, it coincides in all cases with previously known temporal heterogeneity within the site,
based upon known construction and abandonment sequences and tree-ring dates. (40)

Knab, Tim (SUNY-Albany) METAPHORS AND MEANINGS IN CLASSIC AZTEC. This
paper will first review documentary sources that form the basis for our understanding of

51
, classic Aztec metaphors. Sahagun's compilation, as well as lesser known collections of
metaphors by major grammarians and other authors of the sixteenth century, will be
reviewed. A thorough compilation and correlation of these sources along with a textual
critique must form the basis for analysis. Metaphors themselves bear only a clumsy
semblance of their intended meaning; the phenomenon of metaphor must be treated within
the frame of performance, genre, speech event. The affinity of classic Aztec rhetorical,
poetic, and narrative forms for complex multileveled metaphors has considerable
importance, theoretically and practically, for eth nohistorical interpretation. Texts must be
interpreted in terms of context as well as content in order to ascertain intended meaning.
Each major class of metaphor will be discussed with contextual examples. The use of
metaphor in classic Aztec speech can yield important ethnographic insights with real
meaning. (38)

Kohl, Philip L. (Wellesley) THE BALANCE OF TRADE IN SOUTHWEST ASIA IN THE
MID-THIRD MILLENNIUM: A STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS. Most analyses of long-distance
exchange in early States emphasize the way this trade reinforced incipient class stratification
in these societies; luxury goods obtained by the elite distinguished them from the rest of
society. Such functional interpretations present an incomplete, if not superficial, explana-
tion for the way such trading networks originated, how they were integrated into the
productive economies of each participating society, and, ultimately, what structural
contradictions led to the decline of these wide-ranging interactions. Material documenting
long-distance trade in luxury goods in Southwest Asia in the mid-third millennium will be
presented. This exchange system will be analyzed from a perspective showing that the
structure of production of goods for exchange or creation of exchange values in each
participant society is essential to understanding the trading system's “function."” A dynamic
analysis of the development and breakdown of exchange systems necessitates consideration
af the motivational factors and unequal relations that emerge among participant societies.

Kohler, Tim A. (Florida) THE MCKEITHEN SITE: PRELIMINARY REPORT. Carbon
samples from sampling excavations at the MecKeithen site, a large Weeden Island ceremonial
center in north Florida, yielded early dates which may somewhat alter our views of the
chronology and development of north Florida and southwest Georgia Weeden Islandism.
Presentation of the dates and their contexts and the preliminary analysis of a stratified

of hypotheses generated from the sample and their proposed methods of testing. (53)

Kolb, Charles C. (Pennsylvania State) THE ERIE2Z INDIANS: AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL
AND ETHNOHISTORICAL REEVALUATION. The Eriez, a prehistoric and protohistoric
tribal society culturally related to lroquois-speaking groups, occupied the southern Lake
Erie shoreline of northwestern New York, northernmost Pennsylvania, and northeastern
Ohio prior to their political extermination by the League of the Ho-de-no-sau-nee in about
1654. Few explorers visited Eriez villages, and none left accurate reports to permit the
determination of settlement locations. The Jesuit Relations provide scanty clues, hence
most information comes from unsystematic excavations beginning In 1906 that intensified
during WPA times. This report draws together early and post-1950 investigations in the
tri-state area and summarizes current research and cultural interpretations. (42)

Kukan, Gerald (Toronto) TECHNOLOGICAL VARIABILITY AND CHANGE IN THE
LEVANTINE EPIPALEOLITHIC. The proposition is advanced that microlith formal
variation can be explained on the basis of variable structural design of microliths
corresponding to different hafting modes. Hafting models are presented together with
theory and concepts that specify how microliths were manufactured to facilitate hafting.
Hafting is regarded as a technological process and composite tools (not microliths) are
viewed as technological end-products. Microlith design and hafting techniques are perceived
to have become increasingly efficient during the Epipaleolithic. This aspect of technological
progress is manifested in design innovations pertaining to the miniaturization and
standardization of microlith components, the improvement of contacting hafted surfaces,
and the longevity of composite tools.(33)

Kurbjuhn, Kornelia (Tubingen) A COMPARISON OF PLANETS IN THE CODICES LAUD,

30-40, and Codex Borgia, 55, described and explained Sun, Moon, and the Planets to
ancient American priests. Those sections have been studied individually by E. Seler, K.
Novotny, and T. Barthel but were never systematically correlated and studied as one body
of data. By doing so it is possible to order astronomical information into a model of the
universe and to illuminate character, action, and place of heavenly bodies as seen by early
American scientists. Objects and beliefs are traced in other Mesoamerican cultures in an
effort to determine the geographical spread of influence ascribed to the priestly school
which produced the manuscripts. (48)

Mississippian civic-ceremonial centers in the Harpeth River Valley near Nashville, Tennessee.
The Mound Bottom site consists of ten mounds arranged around a plaza and surrounding
habitation areas covering an area of nearly 100 acres. The Brown Pack site, which is at least
partially contemporary, is of comparable size and configuration. A summary of the work
that has been carried out at these sites since 1936 is presented; the dating of the Mound
Bottom site, ca. A.D. 900-1350, and its relationship to other large Mississippian centers is
also discussed. (53)

comparatively dry, high Central Negev suggests an adaptive model that differs from sites in
northern Palestine. Recent test excavations seem to indicate that the huge size and high
artifact density of Rosh Horesha are the result of either true sedentism or long periods of
semipermanent occupation and cannot be explained by seasonal hunting camps. (33)

obtained shows that the hilltop was chosen so that one could watch during the day for game
while preparing tools related to hunting activities. Absence of hearths, structures, and
certain tool types suggests that the site was neither permanent nor used for camping. (3)

Lenihan, Daniel J. (NPS) THE NATIONAL RESERVOIR INUNDATION STUDY.
Reservoir salvage contracts have played a major role in shaping the development of
archaeology in the United States. Decisions as to whether or not a particular site should be
salvaged, left untouched, or physically protected are usually made without the benefit of
any real understanding of the nature and extent of the impact of fresh water immersion on
archaeological values. Data derived from the inundation study will provide a baseline for
assessing these impacts and, when used in association with an adequate regional
archaeological overview will enable the implementation of a true conservation approach in
the managing of cultural resources in reservoirs. Knowing the differential effect of
inundation on various archaeological data retrieval techniques will also permit archaeologists
on a site specific basis to direct their research design toward salvaging categories of data
which will be the most threatened by immersion. The study is being conducted by the
National Park Service through a cooperative funding agreement with the Bureau of
Reclamation, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the Soil Conservation Service. (26)
Levine, Frances (NPS) NOMADIC PASTORALISM ON THE PECOS RIVER DURING THE
MEXICAN AND TERRITORIAL PERIODS. Spanish-American settlement of the eastern
New Mexican grasslands bordering the Pecos River was late in the overall growth of
European settlement in the Southwest. In part, the settlement was tied to the rise of
commercial sheep ranching in the nineteenth century. Ethnoarchaeological data from a
survey of the Los Esteros Reservoir have been utilized to focus on the settlement pattern
resulting from commercial pastoralism in northeastern New Mexico. (27)

OF AN UNUSUAL STELA. Additions to H. Berlin's original list of emblem glyphs have
been made at known sites by identifying recurrent glyphs that meet his criteria of a main
sign with aquatic and Ben Ich (Ahpo, Ahpop, Ahau) prefixes. The stela to be discussed here
has two such emblem glyphs but its place of origin is not known. Comparatively few Maya
inscriptions include emblem glyphs, and the incidence of two in one text is even lower
especially on a stela containing only 16 glyph blocks with Initial Series inscription. This
paper will present evidence to provide an identification of the emblems on the stela and thus
establish its provenience. (11)
Limp, W. Frederick (Indiana) THE ECONOMICS OF AGRICULTURAL DISPERSION.
Archaeological theory concerning problems of technological change, particularly regarding
origins and dispersion of agriculture, have generally emphasized exogenous forces:
population “‘presure,"’ environmental change, genetic mutation, etc. Economic theory, in
contrast, examines the interplay between the exogenous parameters of a system and the
internal endogenous variable, giving a primary role to such things as variable cost functions
of different production techniques. Use of an economic model demonstrates that the
conventional use of population “pressure” or environmentai change cannot be operating in
dispersion of agriculture from its center(s) of origin. Instead, local characteristics of such
endogenous factors as relative production costs, risk aversion, and presence of markets are
shown to be the critical variables. It is proposed that in circumstances of technological
change, such as those associated with the dispersion of agriculture, the algorithmic nature of
economic analysis is more compatible with the requirements of effective hypothesis testing
and predictive modeling than the loosely structured verbal approach most frequently used In
archaeological research. (46)

linkage between stylistic variability in pottery and various aspects of behavior, 12 months of
fieldwork were conducted among the Kalinga of northern Luzon, Philippines. Learning
frameworks, Kinship, residence patterns, and informal work groups were studied and an
intensive analysis of pottery undertaken. The results of this study are reported together with
a discussion of the native system of classification, patterns of pottery breakage and disposal,

of cell count variance. The spatial arrangement of cell count values has been amenable only
to intuitive and non-probability-based assessment. A method is presented for establishing
significance levels for both univariate and multivariate spatial aggregation in grid cell count
values, based on the expected frequency distribution of variate differences between
neighboring cells (or within cells, for the multivariate case). The mathematical basis of the
method is briefly summarized and referenced. Extension of the method to the delineation
of indicated spatial clusters is suggested. (29)

The llama is usually considered as a strictly highland animal. However, excavations in the
ciudadelas of Chan Chan have shown that camelid bones are regularly associated in great
numbers with the highest status burials. Research into extra-urban Chimu sites has revealed
camelid herding stations, and on this basis hypotheses are put forth concerning the position
of llama and alpaca herding in the Chimu state. The utilization of the llama by the Chimu is
then compared with uses of camelids by the preceding Moche culture and by the succeeding
conquering Inca state. (39)

refuse pits, structure firebasins, subfloor pits, and from 50 cm interval grids on structure
floors. In spite of minimal preservation, the extensive sampling substantially altered
hypotheses bases on macrofossil analysis and other data: (1) non-domestic plants,
particularly cattails, chenopods, and sunflowers, were a primary, if not dominant, resource;
(2) differential use of various metate and vessel forms was not evident; (3) food preparation
occurred at both exterior use areas and interior firebasins; and (4) significant differences
occur among similar architectural features. (51)

Magnus, Richard W. (Banco Central de Nicaragua) THE SITEIA COMPLEX: ITS
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE LATE FORMATIVE OF LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA. A
painted pottery complex has been established in eastern Nicaragua which seems to be
related to phases to the south, west, and north. To the south, it ties in with the Cano del
Oso complex of the Ilanos of Venezuela. There are possible connections northward with
Playa de los Muertos. Finally, to the west, it is similar to newly excavated material in the
Nueva Guinea zone of Nicaragua as well as Chontales, Nicaragua. It even shows some
important modes in common with the Zoned Bichrome phase of Greater Nicoya. The
implication is that all of Lower Central America was more closely unified during the Late
Formative than during later periods. Furthermore, it seems possible that during this time
span, the Intermediate Area may have contributed significantly to the cultural development
of Mesoamerica. (28)

(Chanduy, Ecuador), the nature of Valdivia society is reexamined in terms of its
sociocultural complexity through time. Valdivia Phases | and III (3400-3300 B.C.) conform
to the notion of the Mesoamerican Early Formative village, while the settlement pattern
achieved by Valdivia II! (3100 B.C.) is typically that of a Mesoamerican Middle Formative
community. This process continued so that by Late Valdivia (2500 B.C.) and Early
Machalilla (2300 B.C.) satellite farming communities emerged around the ceremonial center
of Real Alto. (9)

Marks, Anthony E. (SMU) A MIDDLE TO UPPER PALEOLITHIC TRANSITION TO THE
SOUTHERN LEVANT. Recent work in the Central Negev, Israel, has uncovered a clear
transition from a Levallois-based technology to one based upon true blade production. This
transition, seen at site Boker Tachtit, began some time before 43,000 B.C. and terminated
before ca. 37,000 B.C., by which time a fully developed Upper Paleolithic technology was
present. This transition differs from that seen in the Lebanon, indicating developmental
pluralism. It is suggested that the southern Levantine transition is associated with a shift in
adaptive patterns, including increased mobility, and was partially in response to local
climatic deterioration. (33)

McAllister, S. L. (Arizona State) ARTIFACT INVENTORIES AS A PREDICTOR OF
SEDENTISM ON BLACK MESA. Site size has been traditionally used in the American
Southwest as a major criterion for determining seasonality, and inferentially the function of
archaeological sites. If large and small sites coexist contemporaneously in an area, the large
sites are inferred to be permanent habitation sites; the small sites are assumed to be seasonal
outliers of the large sites. This assumption implies a functional difference in sites of
different sizes, which, in turn, implies variation in the artifact inventories, features,
ecological setting, etc. of sites of varying sizes. This implied variation will be tested using
Oneway analysis of variance with site size as the independent variable. The Duncan
procedure, based on pairwise t-tests of the different site size categories will also be used to
determine the source of the variance. The data base will include approximately 20 sites
excavated by the Black Mesa Archaeological Project on Black Mesa, northern Arizona. (51)
McBride, Kevin (Connecticut) PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE FLORAL REMAINS OF
WOODCHUCK KNOLL. Woodchuck Knoll is a two-component site of the Late Archaic
stage, located on the Connecticut River floodplain, 600 meters east of the river’s present
channel in the town of South Windsor, Connecticut. Froth flotation was used to extract the
organic remains of eight hearths. Recovery of Amaranthus seeds and a granary weevil
suggest that the inhabitants of this site were utilizing plant species in a manner similar to
Late Archaic peoples in the Midwest riverine areas. This pattern has been previously
identified in the Midwest as the “‘eastern agricultural complex.’’ (6)
McCartney, Allen P. (Arkansas) A THULE COBBLE INDUSTRY FROM SOMERSET
ISLAND, N.W.T. A_ previously unreported cobble industry of Thule affiliation was
recovered during the summer of 1976 on Somerset Island, N.W.T. The Somerset field party,
representing the Thule Archaeology Conservation Project (Archaeological Survey of Canada
and the Department of Indian and Northern Affairs), excavated six Thule houses at two
sites. Basalt cobbles of regional origin were utilized as hammerstones as well as cores for the
production of large flakes and core tools with pointed tips. These unhafted cobble tools
show wear polish only on the working tips. They possibly functioned as tools to split whale
bones or to chop ice or frozen meat. (14)

MAUNA KEA ADZ QUARRY COMPLEX, HAWAII: PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF THE
1975-76 FIELDWORK. Results of fieldwork conducted in the summers of 1975-76 at the
Mauna Kea Adz Quarry Complex are described in relation to a set of primary objectives
aimed at developing a technological model of Hawaiian adz manufacture. Distributed over
an area of roughly 7-1/2 square miles between the 8,600 and 12,400 ft elevation on the
south slope of Mauna Kea, the quarry is the largest known adz-making locality in Polynesia.
Brief interpretive remarks are made on the following: geological relationships and general
exploitation patterns, variety and associations of activity loci, complexity of workshops,
manufacturing techniques, behavioral aspects of manufacture, variability in adz preform
types, living arrangements, climatic change, and chronology of quarry use. (14)

OF THE NORTH PACIFIC: SOME NAUTICAL PROBLEMS WITH MEGGERS, EVANS,
AND ESTRADA'’S (1965) TRANS-OCEANIC CONTACT THESIS. Meggers, Evans, and
Estrada’s (1965) thesis, that storm-tossed Jomon fishermen drifted across the north Pacific
to the coast of Ecuador and introduced pottery-making at the Valdivia site, is presented.
The thesis is examined from the standpoint of the mechanics of such a voyage. The nature
of the surface current patterns in the north Pacific are discussed together with the weather
conditions found along the presumed route, the types of vessels known archaeologically for
the early Jomon, and the suitability of such vessels for a trans-Pacific crossing. Finally, the
survival problems faced by a crew adrift in an open boat on the north Pacific are presented.
it is concluded that contact between Jomon and Valdivian peoples was unlikely to have
occurred in the manner suggested by Meggers, Evans, and Estrada. (30)

McLaughlin, Diane E. (Arizona) THE POTENTIAL OF ARTIFACTUAL POLLEN WASHES
FOR RECOVERING ENVIRONMENTAL AND SUBSISTENCE DATA. Since the mid-
1960s the acquisition of environmental data has increasingly become a standard procedure
in the excavation of archaeological sites. Pollen sampling is one important source of this
data. Although the technique of taking pollen washes from ground stone and ceramic
artifacts is not new, there is very little comparative data available in the literature. This
paper presents techniques for sampling the artifactual material in the field and suggestions
for information that will aid the pollen analyst. Some of the potential for recovering
environmental and subsistence data is illustrated through a comparison of sites from three
subareas of the southwestern United States—Baca Float (Hohokam), Grasshopper
(Mogollon), and Black Mesa (Anasazi). (5)

IDAHO. Focus of the 1975-76 seasons at Owl Cave, the Wasden Site, northeastern Snake
River plain, Idaho, has been on the archaeology, paleontology, geology, and sedimentology
of the earliest cultural layers, including a bison kill and butchering deposit at ca. 8000 B.P.
accompanied by lanceolate points, and the lowest deposits of the site dominated by an
abundance of well-preserved bone of extinct animals in association with fluted points at ca.
12,500 B.P. Consideration of the macro-features and micro-features of the bone, factors of
deposition, agencies of alteration, breakage patterns, and suggestions for bone utilization
indicates that the early assemblage most resembles a lithic workshop—a bone quarry and
industry based only in part on butchering activities and largely on recovery of bone asa tool
resource. (13)

“GESTURES OF SUBMISSION.” The term “gesture of submission” has long been used to

gestures include placing the hand on the opposite shoulder or arm, crossing the arms over
the chest, and putting the hand in or near the mouth. An examination of Classic and
Postclassic representations of figures making these gestures indicates that they are not
necessarily captives or subordinates. Early Postcontact accounts support the hypothesis that
these gestures can be salutations between persons of equal rank and are often associated
with the presentation or exchange of gifts. (38)

Molina, Diana (INAH) A PRELIMINARY REPORT ON THE CHRONOLOGY OF
CACAXTLA. The discovery of an impressive group of Prehispanic mural paintings in
Cacaxtla, Tlaxcala, and the characteristics of the other archaeological materials obtained
(pottery, lithics, architecture, etc.) pose several questions regarding the validity of the
chronological framework for the Late Classic in the area. The presence of elements from the
Ciulf Coast, Maya region, Xochicalco, and Teotihuacan make Cacaxtla an eloquent example
of the complex sociopolitical changes that took place at that time. The mention in the
chronicles of the Olmeca-Xicalanca as the inhabitants of the area would seem to imply a
closer relationship between Cholula and the south of Puebla that requires a reconsideration
of the regional developmental sequences that have been established. (2)
Montet-White, Anta (Kansas) SELECTION PROCESSES IN TOOL MANUFACTURE. A
.eries of lithic assemblages attributed to the Central European Gravettian were examined in
an effort to define certain selection processes that operated in tool making. In these
assemblages where prismatic blades were the predominant type of blanks, the Knapping
process was controlled, and, more importantly, size was the major criterion controlling the
«election of blanks and the preparation of tools. In that case, there should be marked
differences between the distribution of blank measurements and that of specialized tool
measurements. And, both the blank and the tool assemblages should differ in some degree
from the size distribution of naturally fractured rock fragments. Discussing the observed
distribution of measurements taken on blanks and tools from Central European Gravettian
sites, this paper presents mathematical models applicable to the study of selection processes.

eight weeks near a large spring two miles northeast of Livermore, Colorado. An extensive
Late Prehistoric occupation level was characterized by small, deeply corner-notched,
serrated projectile points, cord-marked ceramics, and hearths consisting of groups of small
Tire-cracked rocks, Preliminary analysis indicates this type of projectile point is widely
found at all elevations in northeastern Colorado. Underlying this stratum were smaill,
apparently isolated projectile point groups of at least four Late and Middle Archaic period
occupations associated with hearths of similar manufacture. These include point styles
radiocarbon dated at the neighboring site of Spring Gulch (5LR252) between 2000 B.C. and
A.D. 500. Twenty cm beneath the Middle Archaic cultural layer were two large slab-lined
hearths without diagnostic artifacts. Elsewhere in the site a single Paleo-Indian (Eden?)
projectile-point fragment was found on bedrock. Two large shell pendants and dozens of
bird-bone beads were associated with a primary burial. A secondary burial with no
associated artifacts and lacking cranium, mandible, atlas, and axis vertebrae was also found.

IN THE ENVIRONS OF A LARGE SITE. Mississippian, and to some extent Late Woodland
settlement in the Black Bottom of the Ohio River, shows characteristics that are similar to
those postulated for other Mississippian localities. These characteristics include location of
sites in particular soil/vegetation zones and placement on ground that is above normal
flooding. However, very detailed site location survey and testing reveals a pattern of
population density and site function that is not consistent with many more grandiose
models of Mississippian and other Late Prehistoric social and settlement organization. To
_ the contrary, the Kincaid situation is consistent with that known from early historic
sources. (25)

been preserved, (49)
Nance, C. Roger (Alabama-Birmingham) WOODLAND AND MISSISSIPPIAN SETTLE-

fieldwork were concentrated just east of Selma, Alabama in an environmental transect of
ten townships, aligned north and south, extending from the center of the Fall Line Hills,
south, across the Alabama River floodplain, through a portion of the Black Belt, and across
the Ripley Questa on the northern Gulf Coast plain. Surface collections from 90 sites, data
from test excavations at ten sites, and intensive excavation on one provide information on
Deptford, Late Woodland, and Mississippian cultures. Deptford sites are small and widely
scattered; pottery seems to have been generally unimportant. Late Woodland sites are larger
and far more common; sherd quantities are large, although some sites have not produced
house remains on excavation and may not have been permanent villages. The single
Mississippian site was evidently a large permanent village, intensively occupied. Most sites
are Late Woodland, and here, differing site patterns for the different environmental zones of
the transect aré compared and analyzed. (53)

OF THE MIMBRES VALLEY. The material culture of this phase, recently deemed a Salado
variant, is reviewed. Consideration is given to both culture-historical and behavioral models
related to the occupation. The simplistic model of Salado intrusion is rejected, since
influences are seen from both Chihuahuan and heartland Mogollion sources. However, the
presence of locally made Gila Polychrome in this and the preceding phase conflicts with the
old argument of a Tonto Basin genesis for Salado. Possible interpretations of intra- and
intersite organization are developed. The terminal pueblo abandonment, which was clearly a
rapid one, is evaluated in the light of recently obtained dates. (1)

different periodicities. Finally, the combination of these models is considered. Ultimately,
excavational data will demonstrate which of these models is applicable in Butler Wash. (29)
Netherly, Patricia J. (SUNY-Fredonia) ON DEFINING THE NORTH COAST OF PERU. As

discontinuous valleys lying between the sea and approximately 300 meters above sea level.
Study of the socioeconomic organization of the use of natural resources in Chimu and
Chimu-Inca times, together with settlement pattern data from earlier periods, suggests that
the intervalley littoral and the lower slopes of the Western Cordillera of the Andes to
approximately 2,000 meters should be included within the largely self-sufficient sphere of
ihe North Coast societies. A major redefinition of boundaries between highlands and coast
occurred under Inca rule and an analogous disruption of the coastal/highland boundary may
be hypothesized for the Middle horizon as well. (30)

AND A BEGINNING. During the summer of 1976, the National Park Service conducted a
cultural resource survey of the upper Pecos River Valley. Lands examined included N.P.S.,
U.S. Forest Service, and private holdings. The objectives of the survey were to (1) identify
site occupants from among several groups who have occupied the valley (Pueblo, Apache,
Anglo, Spanish); (2) to create from morphological site typologies a typology of site function
which may more closely reflect technological and environment articulation; and (3) to
determine whether outlying sites are located according to environmental or cultural
interaction parameters, given the role of Pecos Pueblo as a proto-Historic and Historic trade
center connecting the Plains with the Southwest. This presentation will review the results of
and the degree to which the survey accomplished these objectives. (27)
Norton, Presley (Ecuadorian Anthropological Foundation) LOMA ALTA. The early
dates for lLoma Alta that there might have been an ethnic boundary between
the agriculturalists occupying the floodplain of the Valdivia River and the fishermen
occupying its estuary and mouth at 3000 B.C. (uncorrected). The interaction between
fishermen and agriculturalists is apparent by the amount of estuary and maritime fauna in
the Loma Alta midden some 15 miles inland. The earliest Valdivia ceramic at the type site is
a more evoived form of the earlier Valdivia ceramic at Loma Alta and it appears there at the
same time as the type site, about 2500 B.C. (uncorrected). Valdivia ceramics appear not to
have been readily accepted by the coastal fishermen as can be seen in Valdivia and Real
Alto, since a trade ware of different tradition appears first in the up-to-then aceramic
midden. Punta Concepcion, on the other hand, is a Valdivia site of occasional occupation
where the earliest Valdivia pottery from Loma Alta appears. This site seems to represent
seasonal shell collecting by Valdivians. (8)

Ohel, Milla Y. (Chicago) THE CLACTONIAN-ACHEULIAN INTERFACE IN BRITAIN:
RESEARCH SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS. The present study was generated by recent
excavations at Clacton, Hoxne, and Swanscombe. It is the contention of this paper that new
data derived from these diggings must be incorporated into existing information in order to
first reexamine, and subsequently redefine, the long-problematic Clactonian and its
relationship to the Acheulian. The present study is the result of detailed analysis of about
9,000 flakes and cores from 41 archaeological units. Results obtained lead to a redefinition
of the Clactonian in technological terms. Coupled with environmental and other
considerations, the conclusion arrived at is the following: the Clactonian, although having
been a distinct technological entity, lasted for a relatively short period of time during the
early part of the Hoxnian interglacial, was preserved in only a few isolated enclaves in
southeastern England, and disappeared about mid-Hoxnian times with the influx of Middle
Acheulian groups of far more advanced technology. Unlike the Acheulian, the Clactonian
should not be viewed as a long-lasting, widespread tradition, but rather as an episodical
phenomenon, restricted temporally as well as spatially. (20)

Parsons, James J. (California-Berkeley) RIDGED FIELDS IN COLOMBIA AND ECUADOR.
Closer examination has led to substantially increased estimates of the areas in ‘‘ridged”’ or
“raised” fields in the Magdalena and the Guayas Valleys of Colombia and Ecuador. In the
former probably 100,000 hectares, in the latter perhaps ‘15-20,000 hectares, now appear
probable. In addition, it is clear that extensive areas of such Precolumbian fields have been
obliterated by flooding and silt deposition. In the San Jorge Valley, Colombia, sedimenta-
tion since initial ridge construction has been shown to have been strikingly episodic. At least
three paleosoils, identified by organically rich black horizons separated by bands of lighter
colored alluvium, are identifiable at lowest water stage in silted-up furrows between ridges
that line Cano Carate, near San Marcos. tsostatic downwarping of the entire sedimentary
62
, basin has been shown to have been rapid, with rates as high as one meter in
200 years. Radiocarbon dates from these buried soils do not extend beyond 755+
80 radiocarbon years, but their true age is almost certainly masked by root contaminants, In
Ecuador, under similar conditions, two samples from buried soil horizons at the base of
furrows between ridges opposite Guayaquil have given dates of 590 B.C. and 2005 B.C.
respectively. In no other samples was organic matter sufficient to provide dates. Since
contamination by roots is almost inevitable in most ridged field sites, the oldest dates may
be taken as minimal. If the older Guayaquil date could be further confirmed it would make
the Ecuador ridged fields more or less contemporaneous with Valdivia and Real Alto. (22)

prehistoric burial pattern is coming into focus in western Idaho. While many Idaho
archaeologists have recognized the burial complex for over a decade, it is poorly

and explain the pattern. The report stresses the type and distribution of artifactual
materials, which include: ‘‘turkey-tail’’ and bi-pointed burial blades, pipes, projectile points,
obsidian blanks, marine shell, notched ‘‘knives,’’ and red ocher. Final arguments address
time range, comparison to local nonburial sites, and evidence favoring an in situ
development over an exotic import from the Eastern Woodlands. (45)

Pearson, Charies E. (Georgia) ANALYSIS OF LATE MISSISSIPPIAN SETTLEMENT ON
OSSABAW ISLAND, GEORGIA. Reasonable statements concerning prehistoric settlement
systems as complete units require that the systems be bounded in some meaningful and
legitimate manner. Ossabaw Island, Georgia, provides a bounded and relatively undisturbed
universe within which rigorous analysis of its Irene phase (A.D. 1300-1550) settlement
system is possible. Cluster analysis of site sizes indicates that a hierarchy of sites exists. Each
level of this hierarchy is shown to be differentially associated with sets of quantifiable
environmental and cultural variables. This variability is seen as reflective of the sorts, as well
as numbers, of cultural activities occurring at sites in different levels of the hierarchy. The
overall structure of the Irene phase settlement system is compared to that of other
Mississippian systems and is shown to differ. This difference is considered to reflect the
peripheral position of trene phase populations to Mississippian development as well as Irene
phase adaptation to a marsh-estuary ecosystem. (25)

Peebles, Christopher S. (Michigan) DETERMINANTS OF SETTLEMENT SIZE AND
LOCATION OF THE MOUNDVILLE PHASE, ALABAMA. The location of Moundville
phase (ca. A.D. 1200-1500) settlements in the Black Warrior River Valley is determined by
(1) the suitability of local soils for agriculture, (2) the elevation of such soils so as to insure
enrichment from floods but also to prevent standing water during the growing season, and
(3) the productivity of adjacent biomes for hunting. A large percentage of site size (and
presumably population) can be explained by the quantity of maize that can be produced in
tields within a 1 km walk of the settlement. Given these constraints of the natural
environment, sites exhibit a nonrandom, clustered distribution, and a nearest-neighbor
analysis shows a hierarchy of sites which reflects their position in a ritual-regulatory
network, (25)

ADAPTATION IN PALEO—FOEHN HABITATS. Data from thermographs in select
meteorological stations on the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains demonstrate the
presence of warm foehn or chinook (snoweater) winds during the winter months.
t_ongitudinal Canadian data on the winter foehn from Lethbridge, Calgary, Jasper, and
select stations northwest of Edmonton—Ft. St. John, Ft. Nelson, Ft. Liard, and Ft. Good
tilope—demonstrate extremely local climate amelioration in valleys adjacent to particular
orographic features. These valley areas frequently remain snow-free due to melting,
sublimation, and ablation. Known availability of winter grazing habitats for contemporary
ungulate herds suggests similar habitation strategy for Upper Pleistocene ungulates and
human predators. This paper proposes a methodology for location of archaeological sites
within the corridor and between the Cordilleran and Keewatin ice sheets based on: (1)
general approaches in superimposition of contemporary foehn (chinook) isotherms and
present settlement pattern distribution in locating potential site areas; (2) specific
approaches utilizing past moraine, palynological, faunal, and artifactual data in predicting
location of paleo-foehn habitats within the corridor. (29)

, Peterson, Emil (Museo-Banco Central del Ecuador) COTOCOLLAO: A NEW EARLY
AGRICULTURAL FORMATIVE VILLAGE IN HIGHLAND ECUADOR, Archaeologists
from the Museo-Banco Central del Ecuador have found a Formative village site in the town
of Cotocollao, north of Quito. & volcanic eruption about 1000 B.C. sealed off the cultural |
levels, thus preserving a quantity of organic remains. The site lies on the shore of a now-dry |
lake bed, and covers one square km. Investigations point to an agricultural base subsistence,
supplemented by hunting and domestication of some small animals. Structures appear to be
fairly large wood and fieldstone buildings clustered on the banks of several small streams.
Ceramic vessel form and decoration are contemporary with the Early and Middle Formative
periods of coastal Ecuador, dating from 3500—1500 B.C. (39)
Pickman, Arnold (NYU) CLASSIC MAYA SOCIAL STRUCTURE AS INFERRED FROM
MORTUARY PRACTICES. A study of the distribution of wealth and social identity
symbols among 290 Maya burials at three lowland ceremonial centers provides insights into
the nature of Classic Maya social structure and organization. Methodology includes a
technique, Lorenz curves, used by economists to analyze income distribution. Analysis
suggests that ‘‘temples"’ served as mortuary structures for members of dispersed sibs. Rank
and status were allocated according to a combined achievement-ascription system. Secular
authority and priestly social identities were not necessarily concomitant. Late Classic
“palace” burials suggest the emergence of a ‘“‘new class” sharing wealth and power with the
old elite families. (47)
Pilles, Peter J., Jr. (USDA Forest Service) SUNSET CRATER AND THE SINAGUA: A
NEW INTERPRETATION. The eruption of Sunset Crater in A.D. 1065-67 has traditionally
been thought to have had significant effects upon cultural developments in the area around
Flagstaff, Arizona. The ash fall Is believed to have created new agricultural lands that
attracted numerous people from surrounding culture areas. Resultant integration of the
cultural groups produced considerable change between the pre- and posteruptive Sinagua
patterns. However, a different interpretation is offered here. Climatic change is thought to
have been just as important as the ash fall in creating new farm lands. Posteruptive sites are
viewed as redistributions of the indigenous population base, rather than a migrant
population increase. It is argued that the eruption of Sunset Crater had very little long-term
effect upon the prehistoric inhabitants of the Flagstaff area. (4)
Plog, Fred (Arizona State) THE REVISED SARG RESEARCH DESIGN. Used effectively, a
research design is a dynamic tool for organizing and structuring research. As understanding
of a particular problem increases, a research design changes to reflect that increase in
knowledge. On the basis of results obtained to date, both positive and negative results,
modifications in the SARG research design have been proposed. These changes pertain to
almost every stage of the research process, from the statement of the problem to the
operational definition of specific variables. Some of the more important changés are
identified and their relationship to results obtained by SARG members as well as to
disagreements that have arisen within the group is discussed. (10)

Pohorilenko, Anatole (Tulane) ON THE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL VALIDITY OF |
CHRONOLOGICAL FRAMEWORKS THAT ARE SOLELY BASED ON CERAMIC |
EVIDENCE: A SYSTEMATIC VIEW. A temporal sequence erected primarily with ceramic |
material of a given culture or culture area should not be regarded as the cultural sequence or |
historical process undergone by that culture or culture area. Such a sequence simply reflects |
the many components of only one cultural complex, ceramics, not those that constitute a
whole culture. Though chronological frameworks based on ceramic sequences may be of
limited cultural and historical value, the study of ceramics, their distribution, analysis, and
classification is important to the archaeological Knowledge of an area and to understanding
the cultural complexes with which ceramics interrelate. A few such complexes are: trading
networks; manufacturing techniques; levels of aesthetic achievement; and the ideational
systems reflected in ceramics. | will outline a methodological procedure that would not only
enable us to establish a chronological framework processually valid from a cultural-historical

, frame of reference, but also limit the role of ceramics to its proper placement within the
systems or complexes that make up archaeological culture. (2)

Pollard, Gordon C, (SUNY-Plattsburgh) VILLAGES, SYSTEMS, AND ECONOMICS
IN THE SOUTH ANDES. The northern portion of the southern Andes has long been
described as an area which was occupied by a variety of sedentary tribal groups during the
late Prehispanic period (A.D. 1000—1535). Archaeological work in the area has been
relatively substantial, but generally piecemeal and untheoretical. A model is herein proposed
that depicts the area of N. Chile, S. Bolivia, and N.W. Argentina as having comprised a
network of territorially-restricted village systems that were linked by the exchange of goods
and resources. Except for late Inca intrusion and domination, the area remained essentially
separate from central Andean cultural developments. (49)

'AUNAL REMAINS FROM THE MIMBRES RIVER AREA, NEW MEXICO. Faunal
remains from sites of three periods in the Mimbres River Valley are analyzed. It is proposed
that a combination of three major trends in animal utilization occurred: (1) as population
Increased, agriculture was emphasized and wild game became less important in the diet of
people; (2) as agriculture increased, natural communities were altered and animals that
became more available were used in greater proportions; (3) as population and food demand
Increased, a wider range of animal species were used. The reverse of these trends occurred
when population decreased. (1)

Quilter, Jeffrey (California-Santa Barbara) AN ANALYSIS OF PRECERAMIC BURIALS
FROM THE LA PALOMA SITE, CHILCA VALLEY, PERU. The burial goods and practices
of over 100 burials from the pre-cotton components (6000-40008.P.) of the preceramic site
of La Paloma are discussed. Qualitative and quantitative analyses have revealed that quantity
and types of grave goods, burial wrappings, and grave rituals are correlated with the age and
sex of the skeleton. Elaborate burials in which bodies were wrapped in mats, tied with
ropes, and then entombed under house floors or in house depressions are discussed. These
are compared with summary burials in which the dead were placed in houses that were then
destroyed. The latter method of burial Is compared with similar practices at the nearby
Chilca | village site, which was partly contemporaneous with La Paloma. Implications about
the economic and social organization of the La Paloma community are also discussed. (30)

ING AND A PREDICTIVE MODEL OF SITE LOCATION IN THE OUACHITA
NATIONAL FOREST, ARKANSAS. The results ofa statistical sample survey of the Caddo
Planning unit of the Quachita National Forest, Montgomery, Pike, Garland, and Hot Springs
counties, Arkansas, are presented. The purpose of the survey was to develop a predictive
model of site location based on a 1% statistical sample of the planning unit. Sampling was
carried out in three stages by means of transects. In addition to archaeological resource
information, data were collected about environmental variables associated with archaeolog-
ical sites. The result of the sampling was a predictive model of site location based on two
sources of information. The first is a set of three computer-generated maps that present the
estimated likelihood of encountering archaeological resources in the planning unit, based on
the statistical sample. The second, and complementary, source is certain data about the
environmental settings in which one can expect to find archaeological resources. (50)
Radovanovic, Ivana (Beograd) EDGEWEAR AND TOOLS TYPES AT PETRIOLO Il. Tools
from the 1976 excavations and surface collections at Petriolo || were examined under
40-80 X microscope enlargement at the Institute of Anthropology and Human
Paleontology, University of Siena. The assemblage contains tools diagnostic of both
Mousterian and a local facies of Gravettian. The original surveyors (Boncompagni, Borzatti,
and Zei) and Daniel Evett (1975 excavator) believe the assemblage to be transitional;
Chartkoff (1975 excavator) believes two occupations are represented. Edgewear analysis was
undertaken to learn whether Mousterian and Upper Paleolithic tools displayed significant
wear pattern similarities or differences among types that could be considered functional
equivalents on morphological grounds. Both retouched and utilized examples were included
in the approximately 200 artifacts studied in the preliminary analysis. None of the classical
flake or blade tool types showed consistent edge-wear patterns within types. If it is assumed
that systematic wear pattern differences are the result of systematically different uses, the
preliminary implication is that tool-makers were using examples of the same type for a
variety of functions, and were using examples from different types for one function. Much
larger archaeological samples must be taken before the patterning can be accepted, and
systematic experimental control samples are needed to better understand different forms of
wear, but if the present data patterns continue, the meanings of formal classifications may
have to be reconsidered. (7)

such as trade across band boundaries, proximity to quarry sources, and direction of

making process involved in Late Woodland and Fort Ancient food resource utilization in the
prehistoric Ohio Valley. By controlling for seasonal resource availability, nutrient values of
resources, costs of resources, Human population levels, and population nutrient require-
ments, a linear programming model of optimal resource utilization was generated. The
model jdentifies those resources that would have been utilized had the people in question
chosen to minimize labor in the production of a minimum acceptable nutrient intake. The
implications of the model and its test against archaeological data are discussed. The test
indicates that use of some resources served to minimize labor, but suggests that decisions to
use others significantly added to required labor input. Additionally, the model predicts
limiting nutrients on a seasonal basis. This information is useful in examining the nutritional
impact of changes in subsistence strategies, such as adoption of corn, and suggests that some
nutritional deficiencies may have resulted from the consequences of rational choice rather
than population pressure. (46)

he explained coherently in terms of the operation of continuously operating variables. The
application of this approach to sudden shifts in settlement pattern (from nucleated to
dispersed settlement) will be outlined and the possibility of further applications to systems
collapse and to cultural morphogenesis indicated. It is argued that catastrophe theory offers
a number of important insights into the dynamics of culture change. (37)

Amotape (11,500—8000 6B.P.) and the Siches (8000-6000 B.P.) are unifacial lithic
assemblages. These two groups exploited the now extinct mangrove swamp resources from
the estuaries at the mouth of the Chira River and Quebrada Parinas and probably late
Pleistocene fauna. The later Estero and Honda (6000—4000 B.P.) preceramic assemblages
are briefly outlined and emphasis placed upon the shift from littoral exploitation to
hunting, gathering, and possibly early agriculture as a result of the continuing Holocene
dessication and the shift of rainfall patterns and mangrove vegetation northward to the
Ecuadorian border. In addition, the utilization of the tar pits by the Spanish will be
outlined. (30)
Rick, John W. (Michigan) PRECERAMIC HUNTERS OF THE CENTRAL PERUVIAN

reflects the importance of the vicuna as a hunting resource. Excavations in Pachamachay
Cave produced the large densities of cultural material and the tool types expected in a
sedentary hunter's base camp; while remains from a smaller nearby site suggest a hunting
camp function. These and other data confirm the model of non-nomadic, hunting-oriented
cultural adaptation. (39)

oper, Donna C. (Missouri-Columbia) SITE CATCHMENT ANALYSIS: AN OVERVIEW.
Lburing the last decade, Old World archaeologists working with paleoeconomies have
developed site catchment analysis. The technique also has large potential for use in North
American settlement-subsistence systems analysis. It is a behaviorally based approach,
following from the ethnographic observation that human communities supply their needs
and wants by exploitation of a territory, normally that segment of territory within a few
miles of the locus inhabited. Data assumptions and requirements are not overly stringent.
fxamples from applications in Illinois and Missouri illustrate the utility of site catchment
analysis for settlement system modeling. (52)
Mose, Richard M. (Hampshire) MUSHROOM STONES AND THE MAYA BALL GAME.
Mushroom stones are generally believed to be representative of a divinatory mushroom cult
among the Formative and Classic period Maya of Highland Guatemala. Analysis of close to
100 mushroom-shaped stone and pottery objects has provided iconographic and structural
‘ata suggesting an intimate relationship between mushroom stones and the Maya rubber ball
yvame ritual. It is argued that mushroom stones were employed in the manufacture of the
sacred rubber balls used in the game and that mushroom stone iconography Is representative
of the players and deities of the game. In addition to establishing a new interpretation of
mushroom stone meaning and function, the present hypothesis provides important new data
on the Maya ball game, (47)
Nosenberg, Bettina H. (Salt River Project) THE CORPORATE VIEW OF CULTURAL
HWE SOURCE MANAGEMENT. Although federal and state regulations are often the only
factors compelling private companies to undertake archaeological investigations, some
utilities such as Salt River Project, Phoenix, Arizona, have recently become aware of the
need to do more about cultural resources than just what is required by law. Any activity by
a utility on federal or state lands requires compliance with many regulations. Such
rompliance involves the need for surveys of areas of proposed construction, and for
mitigation measures at those locations of potential impact. Archaeological activity on
private land may also be required if a project (such as a nuclear or pumped storage project)
is federally licensed or if federal funding is involved; but in most cases a concern for cultural
Fesources on private land remains a choice for the industry. Salt River Project has
established a procedure that sets the stage for compliance with existing laws and also
provides the necessary steps to protect archaeological resources where federal and state
legislation is not applicable. (43)

Runnels, Curtis (Indiana) ECONOMIC MAN IN THE PREHISTORIC AEGEAN: 6,000
YEARS OF ANDESITE EXPLOITATION. There has been little or no recognition in the
literature on Aegean prehistory of the Formalist-Substantivist debate in economic
anthropology. Yet some archaeologists working in the Aegean have used economic theory
drawn primarily from the Substantivists. In the Argolid, southern Greece, there is
archaeological and ethnographic evidence for the exploitation of andesite for ground stone
artifacts from the eighth millennium until the present. It is arqued here that certain spatial
and temporal variations in this exploitation are best explained by postulating rational,
economic choices rather than other factors. Models based on ethnographic and historic
examples and utilizing Formal economic theory are offered to explain the prehistoric use of
alternative sources of andesite. (46)
Ruppe, Reynold J. (Arizona State) ANALYSIS OF MATERIAL FROM THE VENICE,
FLORIDA, UNDERWATER ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE. Two summers of fieldwork
involving search for drowned terrestrial sites on the continental shelf off Venice, Florida,
and partial excavation of an archaeological site with both underwater and land components
have produced considerable information. Results of analysis of the recovered material have
confirmed a number of the hypotheses proposed in the research design. Underwater and
land components of the site differ in local environment, subsistence patterns, coastal
geomorphology, and temporal placement. Environmental differences between the com-
ponents are significant. Pollen analysis indicates an arboreal flora during occupation of the
underwater component and a high marsh flora during the land formation period.
Frequencies and quantities of edible shellfish differ between components indicating changes
in brackishness of local waters. A study of carrying capacity of local water bodies confirms a
hypothesis of radical change in coastal geomorphology. Sea level changes created drastic
changes in the lives of the site(s) inhabitants. (53)
Salerno, Michele A. (Toronto) A THIN-SECTION ANALYSIS OF JOMON POTTERY
FROM THREE SITES IN JAPAN. Thin-section analyses were done on pottery temper from
three Jomon sites: the Hime site, Kyushu; the Seizan site, Nanae, Hokkaido; the
Hamanasuno site, Minamikayabe, Hokkaido, Japan. The analysis was made in an attempt to
answer some cultural questions concerning Jomon ceramics. Since the three sites adequately
spanned the period from Initial Jomon to Final Jomon, the analysis results include a
discussion of the ceramic temper changes in Jomon pottery through time. This study
discusses source areas of temper and clay and the possibility of trade networks during the
Jomon period. Behavior patterns of potters in terms of clay collection and temper selection
are also explored. (54)
Salmon, Merrilee H. (Arizona) THE SYSTEMS THEORY APPROACH TO EXPLANATION
IN ARCHAEOLOGY. Some archaeologists have urged adoption of a ‘systems approach” to
explanation in archaeology because they believe that this approach is superior to the D—N
model of explanation. They claim that the D—N model does not do justice to the
multivariate nature of causality and that it requires laws of a kind which are unavailable to
archaeologists. In the paper | show that the systems model of explanation, as developed by
E. J. Meehan, suffers from the very same defects as the D—N model, and so it is also
unsuitable as a model of explanation in archaeology. Alternative models, better suited to
archaeology, are suggested. (37)
Salmon, Wesley C. (Arizona) NEW MODELS OF SCIENTIFIC EXPLANATION. In response
to archaeologists’ interests in models of scientific explanation, this paper surveys several
different “covering taw’’ models. Primary emphasis is upon a critical comparison of
Hempel's deductive-nomological and inductive-statistical models with the more recent
statistical-relevance model. The crucial difference hinges upon certain relevance conditions.
Two advantages of the latter model, of possible interest to archaeologists, are its ability to
incorporate explanations of low-probability events and its potential for furnishing an
account of functional explanation. Toward the end, suggestions concerning supplementation
of the statistical-relevance model with causal relevance factors are advanced. (37)
Sanger, David (Maine-Orono) UNIVERSITIES AND THE STATE HISTORIC PRESERVA-

historic archaeologists on staff. In those states where this imposes a problem, one alternative
is to work closely with other institutions that have such archaeologists. In Maine, four
archaeologists each devote one day a week to an Advisory Committee to the SHPO. This
arrangement allows compliance with federal regulations in states where government is
unwilling to provide the necessary professionals. University-based archaeologists also
become involved with the review process and the very basis of cultural resource management
resulting in what may be a superior management plan, as greater expertise and experience
are available to the SHPO. (18)

Schoeninger, Margaret J. (Michigan) DIET AND SOCIAL STATUS DURING THE
FORMATIVE PERIOD IN MESOAMERICA,. Archaeological records show that a great
Increase in human population size and in complexity of social organization occurred during
the Early and Middle Formative periods in central Mexico. Dietary correlates of these
thanges in population size and organization have usually been determined indirectly.
/rchaeologists have been limited by the assumption that available food resources or
associated food remains indicate utilized foods. This does not allow precise differentiation
hetween diets of groups within a population or between populations in similar ecological
situations. Strontium content was determined in bone samples from Chalcatzingo, Morelos,
and two sites in Oaxaca—Huitzo and San Jose Mogote—to identify differences in the
proportion of meat in diets within and between social groups during the Early and Middle
'ormative. Ethnographic accounts from the early contact period indicate that meat was a
high status food often limited to upper levels of society. Thus, differences in the relative
amount of meat in diets of various groups can be expected to reflect social differences. (34)

eastern United States. Initially, the structural complexity of the Hopewell Interaction
Sphere as recently put forth by Struever and Houart (1972) will be examined. Particular
attention will be given to both their criteria for constructing typology of sites and their
conclusions. The distribution of Hopewell mortuary sites will then be reanalyzed using a

Intensive surface survey is being carried on in the 15-mound core area (approximately 200 x

the Classic. (2)
Shadow, Robert D. (SUNY-Stony Brook) HIGHLAND-BARRANCA CONTRASTS IN THE
BOLANOS VALLEY, WEST MEXICO. Beginning in the Classic, ca. A.D. 400, two
completely contrasting ceremonial settlement types appear in the Bolanos Valley. These
contrasts are basically maintained throughout the Postclassic. The barranca settlements are
characterized by circular pyramids with circular patios and banquettes that are derived from
the highland lake zone to the south and best observed at Teuchitlan, Ahualulco, and La
Providencia. The highland centers are rectangular and have vague relationships to those of
the Zacatecas valleys to the east and north. It is postulated that the barranca settlements
were on a lake zone sponsored trade route to the north, while the highland settlements
represent a backwater area that has its roots in a Canutillo-type expansion. Interrelation-
ships between the two zones will be discussed. (34)

Preliminary indications are that Travesia was occupied from the beginning of the Late
Classic period to, and possibly including, the Early Postclassic period. It is suggested that
this period might be divisible into four phases. The first three phases are distinguished by
changes in polychrome ceramic designs and vessel shape and the fourth by the presence of a
fine paste ceramic tradition that, although showing form similarities to Fine Orange
ceramics, appears to be a distinct and local tradition. (36)

ERUPTION OF ca. 1500 B.C. Thera underwent a cataclysmic eruption of Plinian type ca.
1500 B.C., with the destruction of the extensive settlement at Akrotiri recently excavated
by Marinatos and Doumas. Different estimates have been made of the effect of this disaster,
by ash fall, tsunami, and earthquake in the Aegean and beyond; the destruction of the
Minoan palaces of Crete and even the loss of “lost Atlantis" have been attributed to it. The
evidence is briefly reviewed, with reference .to deep-sea cores and to analysis by Drs.

produced. The subjective appraisal of these effects are subjected to statistical analysis using
the debitage from six bifaces, each of which was experimentally produced using a hammer
of different material and, consequently, different weight-density. Multidiscriminate analysis
supports a quantified difference between hard and soft hammers as evidenced by
morphological variables such as various flake and platform dimensions as well as several
ordinally scaled attributes. While the effect of the variation due to different knappers is
relatively minor, much work remains to be done in this area. The overall importance of this
approach for discriminating manufacturing technique through debitage analysis is apparent.

Clovis-like points and knives or preforms, along with numerous steeply keeled end-scrapers,
large sidescrapers, and heavy concentrations of flint chipping debris. Ceramics are also
present at this site, but no radiocarbon dates are as yet available. Morphologically and
geographically, the points are intermediate between the classic Clovis points to the north
and the fishtail points of South America. If shown to be Paleo-Indian, the Finca Guardiria
points may represent the beginnings of technological change as the early hunters adapted to
the tropical forests on their way south. (28)
Snavely, Alan N. (Pennsylvania State) SIMULATION AND BLACK BOX PROCESSES;
FOREST GROWTH AND INTRASITE ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTION. Efforts by
archaeologists to create explanatory statements of sociocultural events and processes are
largely frustrated by the constraint of dealing with “black box" phenomena. The ability to
delineate and study the parameters of incompletely observable systemic processes thus
depends upon the creation of sophisticated analog models. Computer simulations, in
particular, possess the potentially powerful attributes of dynamism, visibility, and
system/model control. The applicability of this modeling technique for archaeology Is
demonstrated by a simulation program (SETUR) developed to investigate the impact of
forest growth upon intrasite artifact distribution and patterning. The structure of this
simulation is presented and discussed, as are the methodological implications of the
quantitative rigor demanded by simulation. The consequences of artifact displacement for
archaeological survey, intrasite data collection, and behavioral interpretations are also
examined. (15)

analysis, appears to show promise. Preliminary investigations utilizing this approach indicate
that discrimination between these cherts is possible. (14)

OLOGY. Scientific investigation of the soils at the Woodchuck Knoll site have proved
themselves to be of great use to future archaeological investigations in the Connecticut River
Valley. Having a firm grasp of the time framework for the area resulting from the presence
of glacial Lake Hitchcock and from radiocarbon dating of the actual site allows us to
investigate the rate of deposition and soil development for this section of the river valley.
Upon developing a scale of both we can investigate the potential for use of soils as a valid
and important dating technique and can use the soils data in many other collaborative ways.

Stoltman, James B. (Wisconsin-Madison) OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON
THERMAL PRETREATMENT OF CHERT FROM AN EARLY ARCHAIC QUARRY-
WORKSHOP IN SOUTHWESTERN WISCONSIN. Surface collections and excavations at an
Early Archaic (Hardin) quarry-workshop in southwestern Wisconsin produced vast
quantities of tan chert debitage, with high percentages of red and gray flakes also present.
Examination of the same cherts in situ revealed no evidence of such color variation,
suggesting the possibility of intentional thermal pretreatment. A series of controlled
experiments were conducted in which nonartifactual cherts were subjected to varying
temperatures for varying durations to ascertain what physical alterations were produced.
The positive results of these experiments are summarized in this paper and their implications
for interpreting quarry-workshop behavior are explored. (14)
Stone, Doris (Peabody Museum, Harvard) THE POSSIBLE ROOTS OF ROSALES ZONED
ENGRAVED WARE FROM THE GREATER NICOYA REGION: AN HYPOTHESIS.
Precolumbian Ecuadorian merchant marines, particularly from the Guayaquil Gulf, using
ocean-going rafts, appear responsible for the introduction of a ceramic ware, Rosales Zoned
Engraved, during the Zoned Bichrome period in Greater Nicoya. The artistic tradition
characteristic of this pottery seems to come from the southern continent, despite some
indications of mixed cultural concepts. The association of Chara and Pocosi Islands in the
Nicoya Gulf with rafts and a different language on Chara suggests ports of call inhabited by
foreigners. The bays of Tamarindo, Culebra, and Santa Elena probably also served as
anchorages with Santa Elena the port for Rivas and Lake Nicaragua. (28)
Stothert, Karen E. (Fordham) STYLES AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE EH-EIP TRANSI-
TION ON THE CENTRAL COAST. Based on newly excavated data, a revised culture
sequence is described for the end of the Early horizon and the beginning of the Early
Intermediate period on the Central Coast of Peru. Chronological arguments are based on the
analysis of ceramic styles, while other data are used to interpret the political and economic
conditions of the period. New light is shed on the Ventanilla style and settlements at the
end of the Early horizon and the newly discovered Villa Salvador style and occupation at
the early phases of the Early Intermediate period In the lower Lurin Valley. Culture change
is outlined for this period, and the conditions antecedent to the development of complex
society later in the Early Intermediate period are tentatively identified. (39)

, investigations have been conducted in the Virgin Islands National Park during the last few
years. In 1964 water-line and power-line trenches were dug revealing historic and aboriginal
materials which were collected by the Park staff. survey and excavation in the Cinnamon
May area was conducted by Edward Rutsch in 1969 and 1970. The Southeast Archeological
Center, National Park Service, conducted survey and excavations throughout the Park in
1976. Each of these projects has contributed significant new information about the
archaeology of St. John. SUMMARY OF VIRGIN ISLAND ARCHAEOLOGY AND
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. The archaeological evidence from the
Virgin Islands National Park indicates that the aboriginal population clustered on the north
shore of St. John. The ceramics are consistent with a South American origin of the
aboriginal population and are sortable into types based on paste, vessel form, and surface
treatment. Aboriginal occupations included farming, hunting of rodents, inshore fishing and
trapping, and shellfish gathering. Historic remains reflect the Danish and African slave
occupation of the island. Additional work is necessary, especially to determine seasonality
in the aboriginal economy. (12)
Stroh, Edward G., Jr. (Missouri-Columbia) CAN THE SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF
UTILITARIAN GROUND STONE BE USED To IDENTIFY KITCHEN AREAS? A TEST
CASE INVOLVING TULA, HIDALGO, MEXICO. Food preparation areas are often
assigned in Mesoamerican residential archaeology on rather meager evidence. The mere
presence of a burned area, or certain ground stone artifacts, and/or cooking wares is often
considered sufficient evidence for making such a functional assignment. Little detailed
analysis has been done to determine if utilitarian stone implements actually do form a
distinct tool kit after deposition, which can be used to define such a SPatially distinct
activity area. Data is here presented for the Postclassic site of Tula, which demonstrates that
manos, mMeétates, and pestles indeed do show a Propensity to occur together in certain rooms
of the site. Criteria are presented for maximizing the probability of correct kitchen
identification. Finally, some hypotheses concerning the social organization of the ancient
city are presented. (34)

Tringham, Ruth E. (Harvard) RESOURCE UTILIZATION IN NEOLITHIC YUGOSLAVIA.
The paper will discuss recent information on the changing pattern of resource utilization
from the early Neolithic to the late Neolithic in Yugoslavia. This information is provided by
the lithic analyses from a number of Neolithic sites in southeast Europe, covering
technological, functional, and stylistic aspects of the stone tools. It is also provided by the
preliminary results of the excavations of the early Vinca-Plocnik site of Selevac in central
Serbia, Yugoslavia. The process of the growth in the range of resources exploited, the
distance from which they were procured, and the scale and regularity of their exploitation
during this period will be examined. The relation of this growth to the establishment of
fully sedentary societies and a productive agricultural economy will be discussed. The
process will be compared to similar situations in other parts of southeastern and
Mediterranean Europe. (16)

scripts, including data on the genealogical background of the persons involved, the historical
events surrounding each case, the sequences of the ritual activities, the objects used, and the
sites at which the events were conducted. It will be shown that there are several distinct
clusters of ceremonies and that each occurs only under specific historical circumstances.

the proposition that the occupation is transitional between Upper Paleolithic and

Indurated packrat (Neotoma) middens from Rocky Arroyo and Last Chance Canyon
(1130-1310 m elevation, limestone), Eddy County, New Mexico, record past vegetation.
Macrofossils in late Pleistocene middens (RAI: 10,560+150 B.P. on Juniperus, A-1648) are
mostly woodland species (Artemisia, Quercus, Juniperus, Rhus, Celtis, Fallugia); Holocene
samples contain more desert plants (Agave, Dasylirion, Nolina, Opuntia, Prosopis). Late
Pleistocene middens contain more Artemisia, Quercus, Pinus, and especially, low-spine
Compositae and grass pollen; Holocene samples contain more cheno-am pollen. The fossils
record a transition from a juniper-oak woodland with abundant grass, to a Chihuahuan
desert scrub with persistent juniper and oak. (27)
van Hartesveldt, Eric N. (Missouri-Columbia) ZIPF RECONSIDERED: A REPLICATION
OF THE RANK-SIZE MODEL. The validity of the Rank-Size (lognormal) rule is
questioned. Previous tests concerning the validity are examined: the size of the sample used
was inappropriate; the application of a statistical measure of goodness of fit was lacking; and
definitions of homogeneous and heterogeneous as originally applied to this model were
misused. This analysis employed all 3,163 cities used in Zipf's original study, the original
definitions of homogeneous and heterogeneous were accepted, and a Chi-square test for
goodness of fit resulted in the rejection of the model. However, since lognormal
transformation of the ‘“‘expected’’ data was originally employed, the data was similarly
transformed for this study, a regression line was fitted to it and a correlation analysis was
performed. The original results were then more nearly approximated. (52)

University survey and excavation Program between 1972 and 1974. Analysis of shell
artifacts and debitage was undertaken to answer questions concerning resource use,
manufacturing patterns, and social patterns. It is felt that shell, being one of the few natural

Von Endt, D. w. (Smithsonian) ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE
PRESERVATION OF BONE IN FAUNAL ASSEMBLAGES. It is well known that buried
bone disintegrates over archaeologically significant periods of time. However, little is known
concerning the actual mechanism of this Process. Even less is known about the specific
manner by which environmental conditions affect the rate at which deterioration occurs. We
have conducted laboratory experiments designed to simulate two environmental factors
affecting bone deterioration in the field. In the first set of experiments we determined that
bone of a given size releases nitrogen (which reflects protein loss) at a rate dependent on
temperature. If size of bone is varied and temperature is held constant, bone protein
hydrolysis proceeds at a rate inversely proportional to the size of the bone. In both
experiments there is also selective loss of protein moieties indicated by a change in amino
acid composition during the experiment. The protein remaining in bone at the end of the
simulation experiment thus differs from its Original composition. These data are presented
individually in order to isolate and quantitate the effect of specific environmental variables
responsible for degradation of bone. While recognizing that other variables such as soil pH
and water volume also affect bone degradation, we have assembled the data obtained thus
far in nomograph-like form to further correlate the two variables and their combined effect
on the rate at which degradation occurs. (44)

Wallace, Dwight T. (SUNY-Albany) A LATE CEREMONIAL ROAD SYSTEM IN
CHINCHA: SYMBOLIC AND POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS. A series of roads of late date
in the Chincha Valley is open to interpretation at two levels. At one level, their regular and
yeometric lay-out indicates a possible ritual or symbolic function, one focus being the
racular center of La Centinela. At a second level, the road system may also have served for
79
, external and internal communication, linking a series of ep-choritic and choritic sites into a
system which would be commensurate with the level of state organization implied by the
documents for Chincha, but not suggested by population centralization or site size. The
layout of the network, with one arm leading to the up-river road, another to the upper Pisco
Valley, and a third toward the lower Pisco and Paracas area, and the occurrence of various
late sites directly along the road network would be evidence for such a system. (49)

on polychrome ceramics. This is a separate analytical procedure from our technologically

design-oriented approach produces a new understanding of cultural contacts within eastern
Mesoamerica and relationships between Maya and so-called **mayoid” polychrome pottery.

Weigand, Phil C. (SUNY-Stony Brook) ATITLAN-LAS CUEVAS: A POSTCLASSIC
PORT-OF-TRADE IN THE HIGHLANDS OF WESTERN MEXICO. The Atitlan-Las Cuevas
site is located on a former island in the municipio of Antonio Escobedo, Jalisco. The semi
fortified site is characterized by a relatively complex ceremonial center, a possible ball
court, terraces, dense occupation zones, a large cemetery, excavated ‘‘caves”’ at the ancient
shore line, obsidian outcrops and quarries, and a massive obsidian workshop. Ceramics of
origins outside the region characterize much of the sherd cover. Most imported ceramics
appear to be coming from the west coast, but a small quantity of Largo Glaze on Yellow
(New Mexico) attest to contacts even further afield. It is postulated that control over high
quality obsidians and the ability to mass produce large quantities of blades allowed the site
to specialize as a port-of-trade. (34)

INDICATORS OF DIET AND ENVIRONMENT. Neutron activation analysis of the
calcium, strontium, and barium content of over 350 samples of recent and archaeological
bone suggests that patterned relationships in the concentrations of these elements do exist,
and that such relationships may be utilized as a basis for the investigation of problems
concerning prehistoric economy and technology. Barium content and, to a lesser extent,
strontium content appear to reflect the local environmental availability of these elements
and thus may be employed to establish the source of morphologically indistinct bone (i.e.,
bone artifacts). Concentrations of these elements appear to be subject to postmortem
alterations in at least some depositional environments. Other researchers have suggested that
strontium is a sensitive indicator of diet and trophic position; however, the present study
does not support this view. (44)

formalized bone artifacts was carried out with the use of stone tools, while impromptu tools
were produced primarily by controlled breakage. Percussion flaking and grinding were used
to perfect or resharpen bone tools. Some tools retained articulated handles. Degree of use of
bone tools varied from locality to locality depending in part on presence of stone tools of
same usage. The selection of bones for impromptu tools varied between the three localities
in the site. The Olsen-Chubbuck site Produced one formal bone needle, but the use of
impromptu tools was minimal. Little Box Elder Cave, which contains a Pre-Clovis Rancho

ANIMALS IN NORTHWESTERN SOUTH AMERICA. Studies of faunal samples from Peru
and Ecuador are beginning to reveal an outline of the sequence of events in the origin and
81
, dispersal of domestic animals in northwestern South America. The major domesticates
under consideration are two camelids, llama and alpaca, and guinea pig. Evidence for two
patterns of dispersal have emerged. Guinea pigs appear to have become domesticated in two
areas, the highland valleys of central Peru and Colombia. Dispersal of guinea pigs to the
Peruvian coast may have been as early as 2000 B.c., but they never became abundant.
Dispersal into the highlands of Ecuador, into Venezuela and Caribbean Islands occurred
between A.D. 800 and time of contact. Llamas and alpacas were first domesticated in the
Puna region of the Central Highlands of Peru. Use of these animals spread early, about 3000
B.c., to the highland valleys. Dispersal to the coast of Peru was about 2,000 years later.
Spread in their use did not extend much beyond northern Ecuador where they are not
found until about A.D. 750. Dispersal south into Chile, Bolivia, and Argentina is not
precisely known. (30)

on the native cultures of northwestern Canada and the eastern Aleutian Islands. Events to be
compared are the emplacement of the east lobe of the White River Ash ca. 1250 B.P. and
several volcanic eruptions of historic and prehistoric times in the eastern Aleutians. We
conclude that relatively frequent volcanic eruptions probably had only localized if
sometimes drastic consequences for maritime North Pacific hunting peoples while much
rarer volcanic events in the more sparsely populated boreal interior may well have had more
far-reaching significance. (4)

Little progress seems to have been made, however, in developing tools to measure the
differences between simpler and more complex societies and in appraising the internal
mechanisms of social change. It is argued that the evolutionist paradigm has deflected
archaeologists from their goals. Examples of factors in the collapse of Mesopotamian
civilization are cited in order to better formulate the issues with which archaeologists need
to deal in approaching the dynamics involved in the rise of civilization. (20)

reconnaissance work carried out in the Chanduy Valley in conjunction with the Real Alto
Archaeological Project, A total of 49 Early Formative sites have been located within a
geographical ‘‘survey"’ area measuring roughly 600 sq km. After considering certain
limitations of the survey methodology, the distribution of Valdivia and Machalilla sites is
discussed in terms of a linear pattern of riverside settlement by which alluvial bottomland
was progressively controlled for agricultural purposes. (9)
Zevallos, C. (Universidad Estadal de Guayaquil) NUEVAS EXCAVACIONES EN CERRO
SENTINELA. A further analysis of the Cerro Sentinela chronology. Centinela is an Early

, Zubrow, Ezra B. W. (Stanford) SIMULATION AND THE APPLICATION OF A KRIGING
SAMPLING DESIGN TO REGIONAL SURVEY. This Paper uses “‘Kriging,” a type of
sampling theory, to interpolate archaeological information in an area in which no sampling
has been done. The methodology is based upon the theory of regional variables. In order to
test the validity of the technique, a simulation of results is developed. The results of the
Kriging simulation survey are then compared to real data. (15)

VARIABILITY AND PREHISPANIC AGRICULTURE IN THE VENEZUELAN LLANOS.
Based on recent research in the western Venezuelan Ilanos and along the Middle Orinoco the
Paper discussed the ecological variability of the area in relation to Prehispanic settlement
and subsistence systems. Within this framework special emphasis will be given to the
intensification of agriculture as indicated by ridged fields and its relationship to the
Arauquinoid population growth and successive expansive movements. (22)
