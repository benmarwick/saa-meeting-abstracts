, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(1) The Concept and Measure of Archaeological Diversity.

Discussions of observed diversity in the archaeological record often address this issue in an
intuitive sense only and rarely incorporate the concepts of richness and evenness of class abun-
dances in a formal manner. Recently, attempts have been made to quantify diversity more explic-
itly, drawing on measures developed in the biological sciences. However, a thorough considera-
tion of the concept and measurement of archaeological diversity has yet to materialize. Papers in
this symposium contribute to that end, first, by describing measurement techniques, and second,
by examining the role of the diversity concept in explanatory models of archaeological variabil-
ity and change.

(1) A Burning Issue? Effects of Fire on Archaeological Resources.

Terrain fires as cultural activities in ancient and modern times effect changes in natural envi-
ronments in which human occupations are located. Archaeological resources of all periods of
past occupancy may or may not undergo significant change when subjected to wildfires passing
over terrain or to fires prescribed as management practice. Aboriginal burning is a factor in the
interpretation of local fire histories and cumulative potential effects upon resources. Analyses
and interpretations of archaeological data from environments characterized by growing fuels
need to take into account past and present fire histories and practices. Cross-disciplinary man-
agement decisions and interdisciplinary approaches to fire effects are needed.

(3) Energy, Engineering and Resources in Early Anasazi Architecture: Exam-
ples from the Dolores Project.

Some factors influencing Anasazi architecture in the Dolores, Colorado area between AD 650
and 900 are examined. Anasazi architecture is a product of numerous interacting factors, includ-
ing household and community organization, patterns of mobility and demographic change, sub-
sistence practices, symbolic needs, available technology, and so on. This symposium explores
only a subset of determinants, focusing on energy requirements for building, operating, and main-
taining facilities; availability and special properties of construction materials and fuels; con-
straints introduced by engineering limits and Anasazi technical knowledge; and constraints
stemming from minimal requirements for keeping humans comfortable and stored food secure
under Dolores area climatic conditions.

(4) Early Adaptations in High Andean Environments.

The Preceramic and Formative periods {1 1,000-0 BC) of the high Andes demonstrate a record of
continuous and concentrated human occupation based in part on the exploitation of camelids.
Presented are the results of recent research on the mobility, economy, and interaction of these
early populations, emphasizing the topics of pre-pastoral sedentism, camelid domestication, and
specific resource utilization. Some papers synthesize the early prehistory of the Junin puna of
central Peru, but other high-altitude Andean regions are represented as well. Variability in adap-
tation is related to local resource structure, varying regional conditions, and the evolving Andean
lifeway. b
(6) Beyond Inventory: Progressing with CRM.

Cultural Resource Management has reached a point in its development where survey and
location of sites alone is simply no longer viable. Today, questions about the data base are being
asked. The answers are yielding important information on a number of levels; pure research,
management application, and public involvement are Basic to advancement in the discipline. A
variety of approaches presently being undertaken are illustrated in this symposium.

(7) Lithic Experiments in Archaeology: Case Studies in Replication and Use-
wear Research.

This symposium responds to the increasing need for a cohesive program of research in exper-
imental lithic archaeology. Theoretical and methodological issues are addressed by way of case
studies which focus on usewear analysis and replication/reduction analysis. Many researchers
recognize that experimental results remain somewhat isolated because they address particularis-
tic questions and are not taken further. Since these kinds of studies have great potential for
interpretation beyond the particular, we hope to facilitate movement along these broader lines of
enquiry.

(8) The Richland Creek Project: Multidisciplinary Advances in the Archaeol-
ogy of North-Central Texas.

In progress for three of a projected five years, the Richland Creek Project is a multidisciplinary
attack on the archaeology of a 50,000-acre area in Texas. Results of a multiphase research design

29
, 30 (9) Lithic Source Identification
are presented in relation to historic and prehistoric settlement and paleoenvironmental recon-
struction. Methods and results for understanding the socioeconomic system of tenant farming
are presented, including analysis of sheet refuse and dendrochronology. Advances in regional
prehistory are presented, including use of remote sensing techniques, geology, and palynology.
Discovery of a distinctive prehistoric mortuary system is discussed.

(9) Lithic Source Identification as an Analytic Tool in Archaeology.

This symposium introduces recent studies in lithic source identification procedures and their
relevance to the solution of anthropological problems. Both the technical and archaeological
aspects of sourcing are covered. Discussion ranges from geochemical and petrographic techniques ;
of distinguishing source localities to their utility in the reconstruction of prehistoric patterns of
exchange and procurement, They also cover a range of lithic types and geographic regions, includ-
ing a discussion of materials from western Europe and the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, and Plains
areas of North America.

(11) New Perspectives in Santa Barbara Channel Archaeology.

During the last decade, understanding of Santa Barbara Channel region prehistory has signifi-
cantly increased. Advances are attributable to the application of new theoretical constructs and
to the collection of many types of data which were previously discarded, such as fire-altered
rock, chipping detritus, carbonized plant remains, smal! bones, and pieces of shell discarded
during bead manufacture. Simple small sites are also important subjects of research. All lines of
research discussed can be applied to understanding prehistory in other regions of the world.

(12) European Contact in North America: Archaeology, Demography and His-
tory.

European contact in North America resulted in numerous and far-reaching consequences on
aboriginal populations and systems. Following the introduction of European pathogens, Native
populations declined and, in some cases, disappeared. In response to a shrinking population base,
European technologies, and ecological pressures, new adaptive strategies developed. Given the
nature and magnitude of these changes, the period of European contact is unquestionably an area
of fruitful research, especially for scholars interested in culture process, Archaeological problems
pertinent to this period are explored, with examples drawn from different regions of North Amer-
ica, including the Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, and Northwest.

(13) Archaeological, Historical and Skeletal Biological Investigations of a 17th-
Century Narragansett Indian Cemetery in Rhode Island.

The results of a controlled excavation at a 17th-century Indian cemetery containing over 60
individuals are discussed in a series of papers that examines pathological, osteological, and cul-
tural characteristics of the Narragansett Indians during a period of intense European contact.
The effects of contact upon the Narragansetts were examined at the level of individual, ceme-
tery, region, and hemisphere, Results suggest widespread disease, persistence of certain religious
and Social values, craft specialization, and active Narragansett participation in the European
market economy.

(Plenary Session) CONSERVATION ARCHAEOLOGY—1984!

Recognizing the tenth anniversary of ASCA and the Moss-Bennett bill, an SAA plenary session
is devoted to a special ASCA symposium. Past conservation accomplishments and our present
context, as well as projections of these ideas into the future, are assessed by a panel of 11
archaeologists. Four central topics (conservation as research; an ethic; a problem; and a potential)
are presented. Each paper has individual respondents, and three discussants respond to the sym-
posium as a whole.

(14) The Ethnoarchacology of Refuse Disposal.

Though site formation processes have received much attention lately, seldom has the subject
of refuse disposal been addressed exclusively. This symposium brings together a set of archaeol-
ogists and anthropologists to present their diverse views on refuse disposal with the aim of
stimulating an exchange of ideas about the subject. The papers deal with ethnographic examples
from .s far afield as Peru and Kenya and as close as your local landfill. Wide-ranging topics,
including refuse disposal as a social act, the use-lives of automobiles, and the use of garbage as a :
scientific data gathering tool, are addressed.

(19) The Resource Protection Planning Process (RP3): Challenges in Implement-
ing the Model.
ye main purpose of the Resource Protection Planning Process is to develop a systematic |
agement framework for the identification, evaluation, and treatment of cultural resources.
, (25) The Organization of Hunter-Gatherer Lithic 3]
This symposium focuses on challenges encountered by federal and state agencies in implement-
ing the RP3 model through an examination of the planning process and some approaches to its
development and use. Papers address planning versus crisis management, quality of data, resource
types, significance criteria, research goals, interdisciplinary conflicts, historical archaeological
methods, educational opportunities, and user involvement in the planning process.

(20) Studies in the Organization of Lithic Technology.

Recent studies in archaeology focus on ways in which technology is designed to cope with
environmental diversity, settlement mobility, and raw material availability, among other prob-
lems. Their unifying theme is “technological organization”, a concept defined here as the integra-
tion of technology with natural and cultural environments. Papers address three problem areas
in the organization of prehistoric lithic technologies: lithic reduction and raw material; recon-
struction of land-use patterns; and measurement of the social organization of too] production. It
is demonstrated that organizational approaches to lithics, in contrast to typological or functional
approaches, better facilitate explanations for causes of material variability in cultural systems.
(21) Recent Research on the Pacific Coast and Piedmont of Southern Meso-

America.

Recent research in the Pacific Coastal zone of southern Mesoamerica is producing a new view
of that region's development and changing external relationships. A “Balkans” view of the region,
which sees it as a Staging ground for successive waves of foreign influence, is being replaced as
new data emerge. Papers address some of the fundamental unanswered questions about culture
history, emphasizing the development of regional differences within the area, Study topics include
stylistic change in ceramics, sculpture, architecture and settlement patterns, and economic devel-

| opment.
(22) Tax Dollars at Work: Federal Archaeology in the 1980s.

| This symposium focuses on federal agency contributions to archaeology that are notable for
their quality and innovation. Although the geographic areas of discussion are diverse, the results
are considered widely applicable. The federal management perspective is presented as an over-
view. Remote sensing applications include overlapping special studies at a National Landmark

| site in Oklahoma, proton magnetometer applications in the Columbia Plateau, and archacologi-

| cal correlations with environmental information in the San Juan Basin, Alluvial and archacologi-
cal stratigraphy in the Middle Missouri Basin are used to establish a regional chronological
framework. The historic mitigation program at the Tombigbee River resulted in the examination
of manifestations of poverty in the formation and preservation of the historic record, A stabiliza-
tion program to preserve eroding sites at Voyageurs National Park is discussed.

. (23) Anadromous Fish Utilization and Socioeconomic Complexity: the Search

| for Correlates in the Archaeological Records.

Intensification of anadromous fish exploitation, beginning in the Upper Paleolithic, is often
associated with increasing socioeconomic complexity. Three aspects of this correlation require
examination: archacological criteria for establishing the degree of dependence on anadromous
fishing; environmental and demographic factors associated with increased emphasis on anadro-
mous fishing; and evidence for increasing socioeconomic complexity as reflected in artifactual
and faunal inventories and in settlement pattern change.

(24) Geoarchaeology in the Northwest: Recent Applications and Contributions.

Geoarchaeology applies methods and concepts from the earth sciences to analyze the integrity
and continuity of the archacological record. Sedimentary analysis of natural and cultural depos-
its offers a wealth of information relevant to past environments and prehistoric lifeways. This
symposium provides concrete examples of ongoing geoarchacological analyses throughout the
Northwest. Regional! coverage includes Alaska, Northwest Coast, Columbia Plateau, Great Basin,
and Interior Valleys. Topics range from concrete stratigraphic, geomorphic, and midden analyses
to considerations of important theoretical and methodological problems. Papers illustrate the
gutstanding potential of geoarchaecological studies for answering archacological questions on
beth a site-specific and regional scale.

\25) The Organization of Hunter-Gatherer Lithic Technology: Recent Analyses.

The organization of hunter-gatherer lithic technology refers to the ways in which hunter:
eatherers manufacture, use, reuse, and discard stone tools and the conditions under which differ-
ent lithic reduction strategies are implemented. This field has received much attention in the
last few years, and much polemic and some tenuous associations between technology and var-
jous aspects of hunter-gatherer settlement and subsistence have been generated, Papers in this
, 32 (26) The Melones Archeological Project

symposium present analyses of archaeological data from excavated sites and/or surveys in an

effort to evaluate the utility of our current understanding of the relationship between lithic

technology and hunter-gatherer lifeways and to suggest productive avenues of research.

(26) The New Melones Archaeological Project: Phase X (1981-1984) Investiga-
tions.

Located along the Stanislaus River in the central Sierra Nevada foothills, California, the New
Melones Reservoir Project encompasses some 682 known archaeological sites. Prior to 1981, 89
of these sites had been sampled by various investigators. In 1981, INFOTEC excavated 10 his-
toric non-Indian sites and three multi-component Indian sites, which together represent nearly
7000 years of cultural activity. This symposium describes the results of the 1981 fieldwork,
summarizes the culture history of the central Sierra, and provides a status report on current and
recently completed analyses of materials from sampled sites in the project area.

(27) Mammoth, Mastodons and Elephants: Paleoecological, Archaeological and
Taphonomic Perspectives.

This symposium on proboscideans presents papers on fossil sites and collections in North
America and the rest of the world, as well as results of recent experimental, ethnoarchaeological,
and taphonomic field work on proboscideans. Papers describe the most up-to-date information on
proboscidean sites, fossil and modern, and attempt to define “patterns” or differences in the wealth
of available data. Controversial issues are given fair coverage, but the main goal of the sympo-
sium is to present overview papers that make information centrally available.

(28) Regional Organization of Hunter-Gatherer Populations.

Most models dealing with the relationship between hunter-gatherer culture and resource utili-
zation tend to be of two kinds: site focused and resource focused. The former are most appro-
priate for spatially limited archaeological phenomena such as single excavated sites. For regional
or areal research, locational and gravity models are most effective. These approaches view whole-
regional site location and utilization as a function of the location and economic value of signifi-
cant resources, measured in terms of variables such as critical limiting factors, resource density,
distribution, mobility congruity, and so on. Participants present methods and examples of regional
spatial analysis for hunter-gatherer populations.

(30) From Fourier to Fractals: Archaeological and Mathematical Frontiers of
Pattern Analysis.

The empirical basis for all archaeological analysis requires recognition and interpretation of
patterns. The convenors believe that considerable archaeological information remains invisible
to us in spite of sophisticated hypotheses and problems because of our inability sometimes to
perceive elusive and incomplete patterns in our data. The last decade has witnessed significant
innovations in formal techniques im the field of Pattern Recognition, This symposium attempts
tq@ summarize many of these developments, analyze their recent application to spatial and tem-
poral archaeological data, and explore their future potential for our field.

(31) Perishable Fiber Industries from Eastern North America: Conservation,
Analysis and Interpretation.

Varied facets of perishable fiber industries are explored in this symposium, using a lirttle-
known but informative data base from eastern North America. Papers consider methods of con-
servation, analysis, and interpretation of fiber perishables. Broad synthesis and local case studies
for the Archaic and Woodland periods are presented, with particular coverage of the Ozark high-
lands, Ohio River drainage, Upper Great Lakes, and northern New England. In several papers,
particular attention is given to the linkage between perishable fiber industries and ethnicity in
the archaeological record.

(32) Cosmology and Social Structure in the Andes. |

This symposium is pan-Andean in geographic scope. It focuses on recent work on prehistoric,
ethnohistoric, and modern-day cosmology and society in western South America. Papers consider
Formative village and later chiefdoms of Ecuador, the Nasca area geoglyphs of Peru, contempo-
rary highland Peruvian social organization and public architecture, and cosmological and sym-
bolic features of prehistoric Bolivia, southern Peru, and northern Chile. The major emphasis goes
beyond traditional ceramic typologies and prehistoric chronologies in discussing pre-Columbian
ideological and socioeconomic systems in South America.
, (34) Cultural Resource Management & Current Research 33

(34) Cultural Resource Management and Current Research on National Forest

| Lands, Region 6 (Oregon and Washington).

. Under the authority of federal laws and Executive Directives, the U.S. Forest Service is respon-
sible for identifying and protecting prehistoric and historic archaeological resources. Because of
potential ground-disturbing activities, the Forest Service is mandated to survey, test evaluate,
and mitigate the potential adverse effect of such activities on cultural resources. This sympo-
sium presents information about certain projects and discusses the relationship between the
compliance process and research.

(35) Hoko River Site Complex: 3000 Years of Maritime Adaptation on the

Northwest Coast. |

This symposium synthesizes the last four years of a seven-year project that involved the exca-
vation of two sites at the mouth of the Hoko River, Olympic Peninsula, Washington. The Hoko
River Rockshelter (45CA21) has received the most attention, providing a detailed analysis of a
shellmidden within a spacious rockshelter. Also, a 3000-year-old upriver halibut fishing camp is
updated with recent analysis of the actual onshore activity areas. Both sites provide data by
which computer models simulating 3000 years of Northwest Coast maritime adaptations can be
evaluated.

(37) The Evolution of Sociopolitical Complexity and Subsistence Adaptations
in Non-marginal Environments: Prehistory and Ethnohistory of Califor-
nia Hunter-Gatherers.

In the past, hunter-gatherer research has typically focused on modes of adaptation operative in
marginal resource areas. This symposium addresses those models, indicates their limitations as
general explanatory constructs, and evaluates food foragers in more widespread non-marginal

1 resource contexts. Papers explore the interplay between resource structure, group relationships,
and settlement strategies. Data drawn from the California culture area provide evidence that

. hunter-gatherer sociopolitical organization need not be of the “egalitarian” type. Similar proposals

| could be, and to an extent have been, formulated for other non-marginal areas, suggesting that

| hunter-gatherer societies should be re-evaluated both with respect to models of that lifeway and
| with regard to general sociocultural evolution.
(38) Modeling and Surveys: Management Parameters and Prerogatives.
‘ Predictive modeling and sampling surveys recently have fomented both enthusiam and criti-
cism in the cultural resource management field, especially with regard to their applications on

federally administered lands. This symposium attempts to define predictive modeling and sam-
’ pling, and examines their usefulness in light of specific legal requirements of the National Envi-
; ronmental Policy Act and the National Historic Preservation Act. Several case studies critically

review scientific and federal management applications of modeling in terms of methodologies,
cost effectiveness, and data acquisition capabilities.

Abbott, David R. (Arizona State Museum)
A Computer Simulation To Estimate the Number of Features at Archae-
ological Sites.

The total number of features present at sites is difficult to estimate from archaeological work
because spatial units rather than features constitute the excavation samples. When spatial pat-
terms can be recognized and modeled, however, the estimation problem can be successfully
handled using computer simulation. This routine assesses prejudices in particular excavation
schemes and accurately appraises the number of features at sites by comparing simulated plots
of features and excavation samples with actual excavation data. As an example, the number of
Sacaton phase pithouses is estimated at Snaketown, a pivotal site for research in the Desert
Southwest. (30)

Ackerly, Neal W. (Arizona State)
Vegetative Cover and Surface Assemblages: Effects on Intra- and Inter-Site
Analyses.

The effect of intervening factors, especially surface visibility, on retrieval of archaeological
data has received little attention. This paper explores the effect of vegetation on artifact density
estimates and measures of association between artifact classes. A theoretical consideration sug-
gests that these parameters are affected by average cover, variance in cover, and spatial patterns
of vegetation on sites. Empirical analyses show that correcting for vegetative cover increases
artifact density estimates and decreases correlations between artifact classes. Since these effects
are neither systematic nor predictable, vegetative cover appears to be an important factor in
examining artifact characteristics based on surface samples. (15)

Adair, Mary ]. (Kansas)
Botanical Evidence for the Development of Agriculture in the Central Plains.

Macrobotanical remains have been both systematically and fortuitously collected from many
archaeological sites in the Central Plains by various institutions. Previously unpublished data on
botanical remains have been combined with published materials to present a chronological over-
view of the development of agriculture in this area. Specific developments are discussed, includ-
ing the appearance of the presently recognized six cultigens, the similarities in subsistence strat-
egies between the Illinois Valley and Kansas City Hopewell populations, the importance of native
plant seed cultivation, and the intensification of maize agriculture. (33)

The Origins of Basketry and Textile Manufacture East of the Rockies.

The genesis and subsequent evolution of aboriginal basketry and textile production east of the
Rocky Mountains were examined in terms of process and product. Though relatively uncommon
by the ‘preservational standards” of the Arid West and Southwest, extant basketry and textile
remains are sufficient to reconstruct the broad outlines of so-called “perishable production” from
the Paleo-Indian period through the Late Archaic. Data from varied and widespread areas indi-
cate conclusively that the manufacture of twining and/or plaiting underlies all subsequent

development in perishable manufacture in eastern North America, as in western North America.
Further, available evidence indicates that the quality and quantity of aboriginal basketry and
textile production is at least as great east of the Rockies as it is in the prehistoric West. Perish-
able data present an unbroken, if imperfectly Saciinetias developmental sequence throughout
the prehistoric period. (31)
Agenbroad, Larry D. (Northern Arizona)
Clovis Sites with Associated Mammoth Remains.

Since 1932, when Clovis points were found with mammoth remains at Dent, Colorado and
Blackwater Draw, New Mexico (Clovis type site}, Clovis-mammoth associations have been found
im a variety of geographic and physiographic localities. Although Clovis lithic materials repre-
sent a continent-wide complex at an early temporal horizon, it is the western sites that provide a
chronologic and stratigraphic framework for the culture. Erosional processes of the last 100 years
have exposed, and are exposing, buried sites containing Clovis artifacts in association with
mammoth remains. It is from these sites and their limited data base that the origin, migration
and dispersion, lifeway, cultural attributes, and the possible contribution of Clovis hunting tech-
migues to megafaunal extinction and the subsequent cultural adaptations to a changing environ-
ment have been obtained. (27)

Ahlstrom, Richard V. N. (Arizona)
A Comparative Approach to the Interpretation of Tree-Ring Data.
In recent years, the Tree-Ring Laboratory has provided Southwestern archaeologists with an
35
, 36 Aigner, Jean S.
unparalleled body of data consisting of more than 20,000 tree-ring dates. These data have mostly
been interpreted piecemeal. By employing an area-wide, comparative approach to interpretation,
archaeologists can now enhance greatly their ability to resolve behavioral questions relating to
the prehistoric use of wood resources, methodological questions concerning the interpretation of
tree-ring data, and problems of culture history at both site and regional levels. The advantages of
this approach are illustrated with examples drawn from Anasazi and Mogollon prehistory. (16)

A Continuum of Microlithic Technology in Asia and Arctic America.

Recent discoveries of microcore and microblade technology in eastern China are dated 25,000-
20,000 years BP. Somewhat younger archaeological materials in north China are contemporary
with “Diuktai” of Siberia. Well-known Alaskan examples of this technology are dated up to
11,000 years BP, while newly recovered materials from Bluefish Cave, Yukon Territory, date
18,000-14,000 years BP. This brief synthesis considers the functional as well as historical signifi-
cance of the Asia-Arctic continuum in microblade technology. (2)

Measuring Intensification of Salmon Exploitation in the Pacific Northwest.

While salmon exploitation became increasingly important during the last 12,000 years in the
Pacific Northwest of North America, it has been extremely difficult to document the process of
intensification. It is not presently clear when intensification began on the Pacific coast or in the
Interior, nor is it possible to measure the rate of intensification in various parts of the region.
One approach to this methodological problem is an intensive analysis of settlement pattern
changes based on the assumption that intensification will lead to increasing reliance on logisti-
cal subsistence strategies, The increasing role of logistical strategies can be observed by measur-
ing assemblage diversity and grain. This method is demonstrated using site data from the
Columbia Plateau and the northern Northwest Coast. (23)

Ammerman, Albert (Colgate) and Keith Kintigh (Arizona State Museum)
Patterns Within Patterns: The Starting Point.

When it comes to recognition and interpretation of patterns in archaeology, we are often
challenged by situations where patterns are nested within one another. This paper covers some
of our recent experience as it relates to the development of the k-means approach to spatial
analysis. A basic goal (at least at the current state of the art) may not be so much that of
identifying specific patterns as that of sorting out the levels of patterning present in a given
situation. This paper looks at several experiences as a means of discussing heuristic strategies
that may be productive in this way. (30)

Anderson, Dana B. (Natal Museum)
Thrones the Looking Glass: Can We Trust Our Eyes?

e sudden popularity of ethnoarchaeology is due to the recognition that archaeological inter-
pretation has always depended upon ethnography and will continue to draw from it in the future. .
However, this dependence must not be indiscriminant: it requires systematic attention, Cases in
point are recent discoveries that many of the commonly held assumptions casually drawn from
the modern world and frequently used in interpreting archaeological materials are faulty. This
paper discusses recent ethnoarchaeological fieldwork among the Navajo with the aim of asses-
sing the utility of assumed and postulated relationships between behavior and site structure to
interpret archaeological data. |15)

Anderson, Patricia M. (Washington)
Interdisciplinary Research and the Problems of Using Different Time and
Space Scales in Geoarchaeology: An Example From Northern Alaska.

Inappropriate "homogenization" of archaeological and environmental data can Jead to poor
interpretations about the past. Such interpretations vary from overly simplistic, causative expla-
nations of culture change to gross misapplications of environmental data inappropriate for the
time or area under consideration. If geoarchaeologists wish to make more sophisticated paleoeco-
logical interpretations, they must pay attention to the degree of temporal and spatial resolution
in the various types of data used in their analyses. These methodological problems are discussed,
using a specific example from northern Alaska to illustrate the variability in interpretations as
differing spatial scales of analysis are used by archaeologists. (24)

: Intensification of Late Archaic Spatial Interaction: An Eastern Woodland
| Example.
| The analysis of lithic raw material is used to reveal changes in the spatial interaction of
| prehistoric groups through time. Projectile point data from the Late Archaic through Early
| Woodland periods in the Upper Delaware Valley are used as a test case. Results of the study
indicate an increase in the variety of lithic raw materials used and a simultancous decrease in
the use of distant lithic raw materials. These trends support an hypothesis of gradual intensifica-
tion of existing prehistoric interaction networks over time. (20)

Modern Regional Landscape Terminology and the Interpretation of an Urban
Archaeological Site.

Eighteenth-century Savannah, Georgia was subjected to an attack by Franco-American forces
on 1779. The area of a key fortification, Spring Hill Redoubt, has been considerably altered in the
ensuing 200 years. Its actual location has been the subject of dispute, Utilizing archaeological,
pre-building architectural, historical, and oral information, the traditional mythology about the
Battlefield Park was re-evaluated, altered, and reinforced. (15)

: Factors Affecting Relationships Between Household Refuse and Individual
Food Consumption.
: A variety of cultural factors may affect the accuracy with which household refuse will reflect
; food consumption of individuals within the household. In a sample from rural and urban areas of
. Northern Mexico, the extent to which household members of different ages and sexes eat out-
. side the household is discussed. Other factors considered include types of food packaging, or
lack thereof, and re-use of packaging and food remains. An understanding of these issues is
especially important if data from refuse studies in different areas are to be compared. |14)

The Non-Concept of Diversity in Archaeology.

The use of the concept of diversity in archaeology is reviewed. Diversity is a quantitative
measure widely used in ecological studies which may be derived in a variety of ways. The range
of computational formulae available, however, may be categorized within three main theoretical
groupings of diversity measures: indices of richness, heterogeneity, and evenness. This paper
reviews implicit constraints of these three main types of diversity and their use in archaeology.
Diversity is shown to be most accurate when examined separately as either indices of richness
or evenness. |15) ‘

Bamforth, Douglas B. (California, Santa Barbara)
Technological Efficiency and Tool Curation.

Recent research has attempted to predict technological organization on the basis of subsis-
tence/settlement organization. This paper examines one such prediction, linking Binford’s fora-
ger/collector subsistence/settlement continuum with his expedient/curated technological conti-
nuum: curation is predicted to correlate with collecting because both are “efficient”. In opposition
to this view, this paper argues that knowledge of local conditions, particularly the nature and
distribution of lithic resources, is integral to understanding the relationship between settlement
and technology. An example from coastal California, where related settlement and technological
changes are opposite to those predicted by the curation/collecting hypothesis, supports this view.

The Implications of Noise vs. Pattern in Archaeological Analysis.

The topic of noise was considered with regard to its influences on pattern recognition in the

archaeological record. Is it easier to recognize a pattern or the noise? When can patterns be so
- small or even so obvious as to be overlooked? How does the persistence of a pattern and noise
affect our ability to perceive them? When, if at all, do patterns appear to be only noise, and vice
versa? The use of fractals is explored within a methodology to distinguish between patterns and
. noise in the hope of giving a new and fresh outlook on noise and pattern recognition. (30)

Laboratory Excavation of Fragile Archaeological Remains.

This paper demonstrates that the recovery of fragile organic materials 1s enhanced through
controlled laboratory excavation. These fragile remains were preserved mostly through copper
oxides from contact with copper beads in burials from an Early Woodland |Adena-related) ceme-
tery, the Boucher Site, in Vermont. Unexcavated burial units were removed in earthen blocks,
often X-rayed for in situ mapping of the compact skeletal material, then carefully excavated at
the University of Vermont Anthropology Department Laboratory utilizing wooden implements,
air blowers, and brushes, Rare examples of textiles and small animal remains (complete snakes
and fish) were recovered using these controlled methods. (16)

Basgall, Mark E. (California, Davis)
Resource Intensification Among Hunter-Gatherers: Acorn Economies in Pre-
historic California.

Acorns, traditionally viewed as a desirable resource, were a staple throughout much of Call-
fornia during the ethnographic period, but saw much lesser emphasis prior to ca. 3000 BP. Two
facets of this pattern are explored: reasons for the intensification of balanophagy in California
and the role which that subsistence reorientation played in the evolution of California sociopol-
itical organization. Ecological optimization models are used to show why this seemingly produc-
tive resource was initially exploited only marginally. This subsistence shift, related to changes
in demography and group interaction, provides the basis for a more generalized discusssion of
resource intensification among hunter-gatherers, (37)

Trace Element Analysis of Obsidian Artifacts From the Southern Plains.

Several late prehistoric and protohistoric sites in the Southern Plains region have yielded a
variety of obsidian artifacts. Because obsidian was an important trade item into the Southern
Plains following the Woodland period, a number of flakes from several of these sites were ana-
lyzed to determine their trace element composition. These were then compared to several geo-
logic obsidian sources in the western United States. The results of this analysis are presented,
and their implications for Southern Plains exchange systems from Woodland through Plains
Village periods are discussed. (9)

Prehistoric Occupation in the Gulf of Fonseca.

An extensive ceramic collection from a site in the extreme eastern part of El Salvador was
recently classified and analyzed. This geographic area is very poorly known archaeologically and
thus the Asanyamba data are extremely important. The materials available indicate occupation
during the Late Classic Maya period. Spatial associations point to significant contact with the
Lake Yojoa area in Honduras, while influences from the south and the west are lacking. Evidence

« points to a vigorous cultural and socioeconomic system that probably intermeshed at some level
with that of the southeastern Maya periphery, but was distinctive from it. |29)

Modeling, Validation and the Reconstruction of Mountainous Subsistence
and Settlement.

While mountains are a conspicuous feature of the High Plains landscape, our understanding of
the area's prehistory is limited by a general failure to incorporate data concerning past utilization
of mountainous areas by aboriginal populations. Archaeological data from the northern Teton
Mountains of northwestern Wyoming indicate that mountainous occupations were a part of |
local prehistory for at least 3000 years. Working from survey data, a process of modeling and
validation was used to reconstruct the outlines of the prehistoric subsistence and settlement
system located tn this mountainous setting. {15}

Evolutionary Explanation of Organizational Change.

Although interpretations of socia] organization and structure are critical in explaining cultural

change. their correlates in the archaeological record are ambiguous. The validity of commonly
wsed referents was assessed, and units at the scales of household, corporate group, and commun-
| ity were compared for purposes of addressing functional or evolutionary questions. Evolutionary

explanations incorporating transformational and selectionist views of change were compared in

an analysis of northern Anasazi community patterns. The selectionist framework is preferred on

Hohokam Plant Processing Tools: The Analysis of Tabular Stone Knives.

The analysis of stone tools from Hohokam sites in the Phoenix Basin has associated a particu-
lar class of implements with a wide-ranging phenomenon of inter-community exchange involv-
we utilitarian goods. The following aspects regarding tool function were evaluated: the botanical
residues preserved on tool surfaces, technical attributes along with use-wear microscopy, raw

: marerial sourcing, experimental replication and use of tools in specific tasks, and a comparative
study of available collections and ethnographic records concerning similar tool use. The pattern
documented relates to a strategy of economic exchange that has broad ecological implications.

The Alpine Village Pattern in the Great Basin.

Between 1981 and 1983, archaeological research in the western Great Basin disclosed the
presence of four alpine villages at elevations between 10,500 and 12,640 feet (3170 and 3850 m,).
Esch exhibits structural remains and an extensive chipped and ground stone assemblage that
suggests occupation for extended periods by family groups. The existence of these villages is
enmrecorded in ethnographic accounts and does not comport with traditional assumptions regard-
ume aboriginal use of the Great Basin alpine tundra zone. This paper considers alpine villages in
terms of the kinds of cost associated with their occupation, the subsistence activities around
whrch they revolved, and their role in regional subsistence and settlement patterns. (28)

An Experimental Approach to Sickle Sheen Deposition and Archaeological
Interpretation.

Developing an understanding of the process of sitkle sheen (ss) formation is critical in evaluat-
emg archavological interpretations of such deposits, or their absence, on flaked stone tools, Exper-
tents were carried out to evaluate extant hypotheses of plant si deposition on stone tools. The
results of experimentation were documented with scanning electron microscopy. Based on the
documentation, several conclusions were reached: sg is interpreted as depositional rather than
sttritional, ss is a result of processing fresh/green plant material, ss is not solely the result of
processing large quantities of plant materials, and archaeologists have labeled both forms—attri-
mena! polish and “true” sickle sheen—as sickle sheen in hand specimens. (16)

Hunter-Gatherer Settlement Mobility in Junin, Peru: A View from the
Rockshelters.

An analysis of seasonal and spatial resource diversity suggests that, in the Junin puna region,
the most appropriate hunter-gatherer settlement strategy 1s probably semi-sedentism. Test exca-
vations at Chupacancha and Huachuamachay, two deep stratified rockshelters near Panaulauca
Cave in Junin, were used in conjunction with the Panaulauca sequence to address the problem of
puna settlement mobility. While occupation intensity and seasonality vary throughout the early/
middle Preceramic, overall mobility is low in comparison with the late Preceramic and Formative
periods. Archaeological criteria for defining semi-sedentism are discussed, as 1s the relevance of
these data to the hunting-herding transition in the central Peruvian highlands. (4)

Ginsberg’'s Broken Bones.

Ginsberg, a 22-year-old female elephant, met a tragic and unfortunate death at the Boston Park
Zoo in January of 1978. Shortly thereafter, Dennis Stanford of the Smithsonian Instituuon and
his assistants acquired her carcass for the purpose of conducting a series of butchering and
bone-breaking_-experiments. Stanford invited R. E. Morlan and R. Bonnichsen to participate in
formulating and executing an integrated set of experiments important for interpreting fossil
bones possibly altered by humans from the Dutton and Selby sites of Colorado and from fossil-
collating localities in the Old Crow Basin of the Yukon. The experiments were conducted at the
Smithsonian National Zoo located near Front Royal, Virginia in early March of 1978. Part of the
carcass, frozen for subsequent experiments, was transported to Ottawa in March of 1979. Addi-
tional butchering, bone-breaking, and bone-flaking activities were documented on videotape and
high-speed 16 mm film. Analyses of the film footage and the broken bones have allowed con-
struction of models of bone breakage; these models, in which pattern and process have been
linked in an experimental setting, provide important analogues for interpreting fossil probosci-
dean remains thought to have been altered by humans. (27)

The Archaeology of Continental Patagonia.

Archaeological information from continental Patagonia |ca. 900,000 km2} for the period from
3000 to 500 BP was obtained mostly from cave sites, On this basis, a pattern of spatially and
temporally continuous technological traditions was generated. Subsistence centered on guanaco
meat (Lama glama guanicoe), but lack of support for the definition of adaptive systems impedes a
real understanding of the situation, Information recovered at a few open-air stratified sites chal-
lenges traditional interpretations, showing instead a broad-spectrum subsistence pattern includ-
ing seals, whales, sea and freshwater shells, rodents, birds, and a variety of plants. A different
picture of localized industries that display slight adaptive differences is suggested. Research is
oriented toward defining the different distributional boundaries. (4)

Hunter-Gatherer Site Structure and Sociopolitical Complexity: The Evidence
for Social Differentiation Within A Late Pomo Village.
Archaeologists long have been interested in the study of sociopolitical organization, but often
| are limited to information obtained from burial lots, particularly in the case of hunter-gatherers,
Recent excavation of a late Southern Pomo village, with intact housepits, provides an alternative
perspective. The distribution of artifactual remains, sociotechnic and otherwise, indicates that
the occupants of one of the houses were significantly more wealthy than the others. While this
evidence does not confirm the existence of a specific form of sociopolitical organization, it does
support the presence of a non-egalitarian system and can form the basis from which further
questions regarding the processes of hunter-gatherer evolution can be addressed. (37)

Spatial Variability in Playas Red: A Ceramic Ware of Northern Chihuahua

Playas Red is a ceramic ware associated with the Casas Grandes culture of northern Chihua-
hua which was widely traded throughout the Jornada Mogollon area of south-central New Mex-
too and West Texas during the Dona Ana and El Paso phases, The wares from Casas Grandes
show a great deal of variability, both in composition and stylistic attributes. Recently, it has
heen suggested that local varieties were manufactured in other locations in the Jornada Mogol-
lon area. X-ray fluorescence was employed in an effort to determine the origin of a limited

- provide a more comprehensive inquiry into the variation and distribution of Playas Red wares in

On the Social Foundations of Large-Scale Interaction Spheres.

The interaction sphere has come to stand for the appearance of a common body of cultural
conventions found among widely separated societies usually occupying different environmental!
zones. Unlike trade networks, interaction spheres are conspicuous in the geographic regionalism
of variation manifested in shared iconography and other shared cultural content. Two distinctive
social models appear to apply to interaction spheres, An evaluation of these models concludes
that both probably apply, but to two distinctly different situations, one in which the shared
symbolism is controlled by restrictive hereditary elites and the other in which a larger co-resi-
dential descent group participates. {15}

of archaeological and documentary data. Suggested ground rules for such a method are presented
in terms of research on colonial sites of the Tidewater-Chesapeake and 19th-century sites of the
Far West. The implications of this method for coordinated cultural resource planning efforts now
underway in several states were explored. It is concluded that such plans must account for the
data requirements attending controlled comparison. (6)

Efficiency Strategies and Their Implications for Interassemblage Variability.

The efficient organization of a stone tool technology contributes to increased interassemblage
vanability due to planned production/maintenance and to frequent, unplanned contingencies
requiring the production and recycling of additional tools. Current models of efficiency strate-
gies associated with stone tool production assume that these strategies result from constraints
om raw material! availability and the existence of time/labor constraints on tool production. It is
argued that, if constraints exist, they operate upon complete settlement-subsistence practices
rather than only upon one class of activities such as stone tool production. Data from Cedar
Mesa in southeastern Utah are used in evaluating these ideas. |25)

Archaeological Considerations of the Contact Period in the Plateau Region.

Sentheses of Plateau cultural development commonly describe native cultures during the his-

terse period is defined archaeologically by the introduction of trade goods which may predate
written records by as much as 50 years, and the collection of ethnographic data by more than a
century, a gap in coverage is evident. Introduction of horses, agriculture, and epidemic disease
dering this poorly known period may have Jed to significant culture change. Preliminary synthe-
ss of available archaeological data indicates thegmportance of archaeology in interpreting cultu-
cal development during this period. {12)

Where the Chips Fall: Stone Tool Manufacture and Debitage Disposal Among
the Lacandon Maya.

An issue frequently ignored by those studying lithic workshops is the relationship between a
workshop and its refuse. Because of workshop cleaning, byproducts of tool manufacture are
seldom left in the work area. A major problem 1s how to recognize work areas that have been

. cleaned of manufacturing debris. Study of modern Lacandon blade workshops suggests that such
work areas can be identified if special care is taken during excavation to recover microdebitage.
Results of this analysis are congruent with what is known about the disposal of lithic or glass

Variability and Definition of Sican Ceramics at Batan Grande, Peru.

Analvsis of recently excavated ceramics from Batan Grande forced reconceptualization of the
range and diagnostics of Middle and Late Sican ceramics. The variety of time-sensitive traditions
documented stratigraphically from residential contexts and graves spans the Middle horizon.
These include fine brown/orange and black ware and three plate varieties: painted, unpainted
oxidized, and unpainted reduced. The sudden emergence of plates in the Early Middle horizon
mazy attest to Cajamarca influence. Fine ware diagnostics include Moche elements and are much
broader than the "Sican lord” complex traditionally called the "Lambayeque style.” This limited
conceptualization has hampered recognition of Sican occupation of the North Coast. (4!

Society, Symbols and Architecture.

in order to use symbols to reconstruct past behavior and attitudes, archaeologists must deter-
eine what elements of recovered material culture were involved in transmitting cultural infor-
mation. One data set is provided by the ethnohistoric study of architectural symbols and their
relationship to culture and society in frontier Illinois (ca. AD 1800-1865). Preliminary conclu-
sons elucidate the structural relationship between ideas, symbols, and information exchange.
The primary conclusion: Cultural information is communicated by a building operating as a
coherent whole, greater than the sum of its parts. The building consists of meaningful units
which gain coherent communicative power when viewed in toto. Therefore, the analysis of parts
wethout consideration for the whole provides a distorted and potentially erroneous basis for the
reconstruction of past social processes. (15)

Specialization in Ceramic Production Among the Late Prehispanic Huanca.

Data from extensive surface collections and excavations at late prehispanic Huanca villages in
Peru's Central Highlands were used to study the development of occupational differentiation in
chiefdom-level polities and the reorganization of production which occurred upon Inca conquest.
At both the site and household levels, the ratio of ceramic wasters to all sherds indicates the
relative importance of ceramic production as opposed to use. Specifically, high ratios indicate
production for exchange, median scores indicate production for use, and the absence of wasters
indicates the absence of ceramic production. (4)

phase tricheras site in south-central Arizona. Prominent site features include more than 250
dry-laid masonry house foundations, an intricate network of plazas and trails, and a variety of
agricultural features, e.g., terraces, gridded gardens, and water diversion devices. The structure
and development of the community was examined through formal analysis of house variability
and intrasite spatial patterning. The implications of this study for understanding Classic period
residential aggregation and community structure are discussed. (36)

Paleobotanical Research at Cerros, A Late Preclassic Site in Northern Belize.

Palynology and the analysis of carbonized plant remains from Cerros are contributing signifi-
cantly to the understanding of subsistence and paleoecology at this Late Preclassic Maya site.
Although research is still in its early stages, macrobotanical remains and/or pollen from culti-
vated crops including maize (Zea mays), squash (Cucurbita pepo), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum),
cacao (Theobroma cacao}, and possibly the common bean {Phaseolus vulgaris) have been identi-
fied in the village midden deposits. Palynology was used to document the crop(s| grown on three
groups of raised fields, and modern pollen rain studies at Cerros were used as aids in reconstruct-
ing past vegetation. (29}

The Mesoamerican Boundary and Central America.

The term Mesoamerica should be reconsidered since its use has not led to clarification of
interaction between the complex and state-level societies of Greater Mexico (Mexico, Guatem-
ala, and Belize) and less complexly organized inhabitants of Central America, The independent
cultural development of Central America is hypothesized, based on the dramatically different
pace of cultural evolution in each area and the unsuccessful economic exploitation of Central
America by Greater Mexico. Supporting data from recent research in Costa Rica and other loca-
tions in Central America are presented. (29)

Economic Modeling of Anadromous Fish Utilization at the Hoko River Site.

As an important part of a coastal subsistence strategy, use of salmon is modeled in conjunc-
tion with the use of other coastal resources in the Olympic Peninsula region. A mixed-goal
simulation model predicts various emphases on salmon, depending on the degree of storage
versus non-storage practices, changes in human population sizes, changes in settlement patterns,
environmental! shifts, and changes in harvesting efficiencies. Two archaeological fishing camps,
the Hoko River and Hoko Rockshelter sites, provide data for testing the accuracy of this regional
predictive model. The results demonstrate how significantly other coastal resources can affect
the overall use of salmon, thus providing a more realistic view of its importance. (23)

Predictive Modeling of Prehistoric Economic Patterns in the Hoko River
Region.

The research design of the Hoko River Archaeological Project has centered on developing and
refining computer-based simulation models that predict the evolution of economic decisionmak-
ing, using a substantial mixed-goal subsistence model for prehistoric hunter-gatherer-fishers in

| this Northwest Coast region. The model predicts through time the potential changes in seasonal
resource usc, Storage activities, population Jevels, settlement, and labor organization. The predic-

tive economic models are being tested and evaluated through analysis and interpretation of
archaeological data pertaining to subsistence activities. Several hypotheses developed from the
modeling need to be tested with data from the rockshelter and wet/dry sites. (35)

Lithic Craft Specialization and Social Relations Among Hunter-Gatherers.

\ Archaeologists engaged in lithic studies have made significant contributions to our under-
standing of technoenvironmental factors which account for variation and variability in the
archaeological record of hunter-gatherers. Social factors have received less attention. The shift in
emphasis proposed here treats the organization of production (division of labor, generation, and
manipulation of surplus) as variable rather than constant. In particular, discussion focuses on the
emphications of lithic craft specialization for social relations in egalitarian and ranked societies.
Changes in lithic technology at the end of the Late Archaic period in the Northeast are viewed
trem this perspective. |20)

The Morphology and Function of Hohokam Small Structures.

The study of architectural variability in the Hohokam region has generally lagged behind that
m more northerly areas of the Southwest. While variability in structure material, size, and mor-
phology has been recognized, the function of these differences within the larger settlement-
subsistence system has largely gone unexplored. One aspect of Hohokam architectural variabil-
wy which has been previously noted but for the most part ignored is the small structure, 9 m? or
less in size. Both isolated small structures and those found near larger structures are united by
cemmon attributes other than size. Since such small structures served a variety of functions
ethmographically in southern Arizona, it is possible to assess the probable function of such small
structures. (36)

Archaeological Sites and Habitation Potential in Riverine Environments.

Changes in depositional environments through time are particularly evident in archaeological
sents along river and stream systems. River shorelines, Qhannel beds, and flood plains are contin-
ewusly mm motion. They are dynamic, not static, and even minor shifts dictate when and, more
mnpertantly, where archaeological sites may be located. This paper discusses the evidence avail-
sble to archacologists in the field as well as in the laboratory. Protohistoric and prehistoric sites
eettated along ancient and present river shorelines in soughwesern Alaska and Washington are
examined in detail. (24)

Organizational Prototypes for Andean State Development.

Seuth American complex societies are thought to be rooted in either an agricultural or a

formations is presented for the Valdivia (3300-1500 BC) culture of Ecuador. It is suggested that
Chemet m economic productivity, village layout, settlement distribution, and cosmology were
Gemineed by the relations of production in the Valdivia community. Consequently, the organi-
Satiow of the early Valdivia village contained some rudimentary elements of later Andean com-

The Lava Butte Site, Central Oregon.
Lava Butte was originally excavated in 1961 prior to the construction of a gas pipeline. The
single cultural component identified was attributed to Late Prehistoric period hunting groups
fron the northern Great Basin and Columbia Plateau. A reanalysis of the site assemblage and
stratigraphy indicates that this interpretation is an oversimplification of the site record. Rather,
a nearly continuous sequence of occupation by northern Great Basin hunting and gathering
groups over the last 3000 years or more is a more accurate view. Reanalysis of the site assemb- |
lage and stratigraphy are discussed in light of recent data from the Deschutes River Basin. (34)

The central question is: Why, after 65 years of work, are we not farther along? Chronological
controls are reasonably well developed, but problems of formal phase definition remain difficult
and studies of cultural adaptation and change are at best in an early stage. The situation is
reviewed in relation to archaeological developments in the United States as a whole. (17)

In 1978, the Arkansas Archeological Survey received a grant from the NPS to develop a pilot

grant from the NPS to draft a State Plan for historic and architectural resources. The AHPP used
the historic archaeology study units as a base, but the two plans for identification, evaluation,
and treatment of cultural resources have been drawn up completely separately thus far. The
archaeological Study Units are being used as the base for development of research designs; the
AHPP is pursuing its Plan through intensive on-the-ground surveys of historic structures in
selected areas. Eventually, the two plans will be made into a single volume. {19}

The-tndian Creek (24BW626) open-air occupation site in the west-central Montana Rockies
consists of +8 m of culturally stratified flood plain alluvium which contains 15 bone-bearing and
« 11 culture-bearing strata bracketed between Glacier Peak, Layer G, and Mt. Mazama tephras; that
part of the Holocene unit above Mazama has not yet been sampled. Ten occupied surfaces have
been radiocarbon dated, beginning with the Folsom complex and extending to an early side-
notched point association or Bitterroot complex floor immediately beneath Mazama. A shift
from subsistence emphasis on bison, marmot, and smaller vertebrates to mountain sheep oc-
curred at ca. 7200 BP. Indian Creek presents a well-preserved natural and cultural stratigraphic

Reconstructing Aboriginal Demographic Change from Historic Contexts: The
Eastern Timucua of Florida.
Archacological knowledge concerning Contact period demography and settlement of Eastern
Timucua is limited and insufficient for tracing processes of population decline. Close and con-
sistent contact between the Eastern Timucuans and the Spanish settlers of St. Augustine between
AD 1565 and 1760, however, resulted in the widespread and regular incorporation of aboriginal
material culture into historic Spanish contexts, Eleven years of excavation in St. Augustine per-
mit a temporally well-controlled depiction of occurrence and changes in frequency of aboriginal
materials through time. Used in conjunction with ethnohistory, it is possible to employ archaco-
logical data to more precisely trace Indian population decline and replacement in northeast
Florida from the 16th through the | 8th centuries. |12)

The Preservation Ethic, Construction and Cultural Resource Management: A
Question of Balance.

This paper discusses the necessity for balance between the preservation ethic which emphas-
izes in-place preservation and minimal excavation, the need for accurate information to allow
careful management of the resource base, and the impacts and schedules of construction agen-
coes. A case study is the Deer Creek Site, Oklahoma, designated a National Landmark in 1974.
Comstruction impacts place the site within the 50-year flood pool of Kaw Lake. The first phase of
the enterdisciplinary mitigation plan involved an ethnohistoric study which refuted previous

opinions that it was the site of a French fort and substantiated Deer Creek as an early to mid-
8th century village of Wichita-speakers utilized by the French as a base for the hunting and
processing of bison, deer, and bear. The site had never been professionally excayated, and the
special studies conducted include resistivity, radar, soils, magnetometry, and extant floral identi-
tecation. The results of these studies, plus photogrammetric mapping and true and false-color
aerial photography, are compared in terms of information content, cost, and easé of execution.

The Mousterian Industry from Bisitun (Iran).

Btsatun, a small cave situated on the flanks of the Zagros. Mountains, was excavated by Coon
tm 1949. Based on the analysis of a portion of the material by Skinner {1965}, the site is currently
believed to have contained an example of the Zagros Group Mousterian. However, recent exam-
imation of this collection revealed many interesting aspects that were not previously described,
iscluding Levallois technique and Kostenki knives (=Nahr Ibrahim cores). This paper presents a

Ceramic Diversity and Cultural Interaction in Southeastern North America.

ether in the Carolina Piedmont area. For each area, sites were arranged in chronological order
amd the ceramics were examined for changes in diversity through time. It is suggested that, in
both areas, increases in ceramic diversity can be tied to periods of intensified cultural interac-

| A New Method for Aging Adult White-Tailed Deer.

| Odocoileus virginianus (white-tailed deer) skeletal remains dominate most vertebrate faunal

assemblages from eastern North American aboriginal sites. Reconstruction of the age composi-
teen of kill populations, as well as faunal quantification techniques such as “minimum number
of individuals” and “percentages of meat contribution", require accurate estimates of the chrono-
beercal age of animals represented. Most macroscopic age determinations of adult deer remains
are based on comparisons to Severinghaus’ (1949) wear stages of the mandibular post-canine
dentition. The present analysis provides an additional method for characterizing occlusal enamel
wear. Derived from Payne's (1973) work on Old World artiodactyls, schematic representations of
wear patterns on all Odocoileus virginianus post-canine teeth provide precise documentation of
eeciusal wear. Subsequent comparison with a series of wear stages derived from an analysis of
modern deer specimens allows for relative age determination of each specimen in the sample.

Spatial Analysis of Artifact Distributions from an Archaic Site in the Tucson

Although the general distribution of Archaic sites in southern Arizona is fairly well known,

the underlying settlement system remains problematic. Difficulties in interpreting Archaic set-

tlement patterns have been compounded when artifacts from sites have been treated as homo-

geneous assemblages. Research at the Flying V Ranch Site on the northern bajada of the Tucson

Rasin included the analysis of point provenience data from the surface artifacts. This approach,

integrated with artifact analyses, avoided previous difficulties in analysing upland sites and aided

in drawing inferences about site formation and function. Implications for Archaic subsistence

systems are discussed. (18)

When Refuse Isn't Garbage: Mesoamerican End-of-Cycle Ceremonial Refuse.

The Aztecs celebrated the end of 52-year cycles with rituals that included ceremonial dump-

rituals. Colonial Yucatec Maya celebrated the end of solar years with series of rituals in which
household and temple furnishings were ceremonially dumped. End-of-cycle renewal ceremonies
with ritual dumping may go back to Preclassic times and occur throughout Mesoamerica; they
are still practiced by the Highland Maya. A Late Classic Maya example was investigated at
Lagartero, Chiapas. Many Mesoamerican archaeological finds should be re-examined in the light
of this apparently pervasive and persistent trait of ceremonial dumping to mark the end of time
cycles. (14)

Morphological Projectile Point Typology of the Great Basin: Replication,
Experimentation and Technological Analysis.

Morphological typologies of projectile points in the American Great Basin have often been
employed as time-sensitive prehistoric cultural markers. This paper conclusively demonstrates
that the contingencies of point manufacture, hafting, use, and rejuvenation do create morpholog-
ical changes that render current “anthropological” applications of these morphological typologies
useless as prehistoric cultural markers. Specifically, 15 projectile points were replicated accord-
ing to the attributes of a commonly employed typological scheme for the Great Basin. Experi-
ments with hafting, penetration, and rejuvenation demonstrate that more than one "time-sensi-
tive” shape may have occurred within the normal use-life of a single point type. (7)

Cottontail Rabbit Procurement Among Dolores Anasazi.

The Anasazi of the Dolores River Valley, southwestern Colorado relied upon rabbits and other
small mammals as an important source of protein. A model suggests that these smal] mammals
were procured close to sites at which they were used. Two species of cottontail rabbit, Nuttall’s
cottontail |(Sylvilagus nuttallii) and desert cottontail (Sylvilagus audubonii), were available within
the Dolores area during Anasazi occupation, assuming that the distributions of present-day and
prehistoric species coincide. Measurements of approximately 300 cottontail rabbit mandibles
confirm the utilization of both species. Differences in species Composition at 27 sites supports a
model of locally selective hunting strategies for small game. |18)

The Weiker Site: A Loma San Gabriel Hamlet in Durango, Mexico.

The Weicker Site is a small Loma San Gabriel hamlet located in the uplands of the Sierra
Madre Occidental southwest of the city of Durango, Mexico. Two compounds surrounded by
low, slab stone retaining walls were excavated. These compounds contained the remains of house
structures and plaza areas which functioned as activity areas for cooking and other activities.
Functional and distributional analyses of the artifacts were utilized to reconstruct activities
carrfed out at the site. Distributional studies were employed in an effort to interpret the utiliza-
tion and organization of space. (29)

Lithic Analysis as a Means of Processual Inference in Southern Mesoamerica.

Within the past 15 years or so, lithic analysis has assumed a prominent role in the study of
ancient social process in southern Mesoamerica. The potential of lithic studies for exploring
ancient manufacturing behavior and production, function, subsistence patterns, distribution,
networks, and regional sociopolitical organization has been richly realized, particularly in the
Maya Lowlands and the southeastern highlands. These recent developments in southern Meso-
american lithic studies are surveyed, and some future trends are suggested. (21)

: The Use of Obsidian Anaylses to Establish “Units of Contemporaneity”.

Through methods associated with hydration and sourcing analyses of archaeological obsidian,
a cultural sequence was defined for the higher elevations of northwestern California, and tem-

bocality. It is suggested that productive results can be achieved by the use of obsidian to develop
cultural units of contemporaneity, as contrasted with an exclusive emphasis on the search for

Chipping Detritus and Distribution of Activities.

Methods used to distinguish activity areas within sites by examining chipped stone detritus
ere discussed. The occupants of a Late period Chumash village preferred to use certain stone
mesterials for particular tools, Point manufacturing was distinfuished from other chipped stone
setienties on the basis of flake size and material. The distribution of these flakes was then used

The utility of a site structural approach, which examines the relationships between features
and structures on and among sites, is demonstrated. Changes in site structural relationships
through time were used to consider the problem of architectural changes, specifically the

tures, as well as their position inside or outside of structures, are indications of changing social
and natural conditions. These changing conditions are analyzed in terms of causes of the |

Advances in the Study of Indeterminate Lithic Scatters.

Lithic scatters of unknown cultural and temporal affiliation frequently form a significant part
of the cultural resources encountered by any inventory survey in New Mexico. Prior to the rise
of public archaeology, these sites were frequently ignored because they presented substantial
analytical problems. Analyses carried out by Public Service Company of New Mexico archaeolo-
gists On materials recovered from two widely separated areas of the State indicate that careful
study of raw material procurement and lithic reduction may pave the way for making relatively
secure cultural and temporal assignments for these sites. Once that hurdle has been passed, it
will be possible to analyze patterns of site placement, (6)

Political Force and Agricultural Production Change in the Huanca Develop-
ment of Central Peru.

Resource use, food procurement, and access have been recognized as important components in
cultural evolution and economic stratification. To examine the relationships of land-use and
agricultural production in the internal development of the Huanca ethnic group, archaeological
evidence of the onset of social stratification is discussed. Local land-use information is pres-

« ented, forming models of prehistoric production for several sociopolitical orientations. Archae-
obotanical data analyzed from the region provide evidence for changing agricultural production,
which coincides with predictions of Huanca political development. (4)

New Evidence for Regional Development on the South Coast of Guatemala.

The evidence revealed by the evolution of ceramic types and sculptural styles on the South
Coast of Guatemala is utilized to demonstrate and explain the apparent sequence of events in
that region. It is shown that, from a common cultural tradition during the Early Preclassic, there
arose in the succeeding periods two different cultural developments (Complex | and Complex 2).
The Early Classic witnessed profound changes as Complex | penetrated into the area of Complex
2 and introduced Teotihuacan influence. Another major sociopolitical reorganization followed in
the Late Classic. (21)

| Social Organizational Constraints and the Use of Upland Habitats in North-
west California.
Hetween approximately 4500 and 2500 BP, during the mid-Holocene climatic optimum, the
I mountains of northwestern California contained a diverse resource base exploited by small,
mobile groups. Following this interval, a change to cooler conditions coincided with a shift to
specialized use of the uplands. During this time, semi-sedentary residences with storage facilities
| were established proximal to oak zones and adjacent to anadromous fish runs. By the Late Pre-
| mistoric period, the upland resource base had improved; however, use of that zone remained
specialized due to the development of a status-based organizational structure linked to the stor-

age of resource surpluses and intensified exchange relationships. (37)

Dental Pathologies at Sarai Khola: An Analysis of the Effects of Subsistence
Patterns on an Iron Age Population in Northern Pakistan.

An adaptive and evolutionary perspective was used to analyze the dental pathology profile of
the Iron Age skeletal series from Sarai Khola (Northern Pakistan). Recent excavation of this
post-Harappan cemetery, dated ca. 3000 BP, has thus far produced human osteological remains of
3! mdividuals. Dentitions were examined to determine the incidence of caries, hypoplasia,
abeesses, alveolar resorption, calculus, ante-mortem tooth loss, and crowding. Since graves at
Sarai Khola lack artifacts, insights derived from d tal pathology are crucial in reconstructing
the subsistence patterns and diet characteristics of this population. |2)

This study examines changes in point blade size, morphology, and edge angle associated with
the maintenance and use of a replicated point assemblage. By systematically recording changes |
in blade size and edge angle that derive from tool maintenance and use, the use-life sequence can
be illustrated graphically. Changes in blade morphology were documented over the life of each
tool using a dichotomy of normative and economizing maintenance strategies. Results suggest
that the maintenance of normative tool styles frequently shortens the life of a tool, while tool
economizing strategies often lengthen it. The use of normative point typologies was evaluated,

Deliberate chaparral burning by Chumash Indians of the central Coast Range of California is

Segeest that the Chumash did not burn chaparral. Consequently, the Chumash had little effect
om the distribution and density of chaparral and on the occurrence of wildfires. The frequency of

Analyses of faunal remains and artifacts from protohistoric water-saturated levels of the site
indicate a fully maritime economy, and strongly suggest that more food was harvested than
could be consumed by the site's occupants. This surplus consisted primarily of the meat and oil
of whales and seals. It is suggested that the historic trade in necessary subsistence commodities
such as smoked fish and meat, oil, canoes, and house planks has considerable time depth in this

Obsidian Procurement Patterns and Sociocultural Complexity.

Studies of prehistoric obsidian exchange and procurement in California have heen greatly in-
fluenced by use of the direct historical approach. Using ethnolinguistic group boundaries estab-

largely as univariate phenomena unaffected by variability in interest-group alliances or other
sociocultural activities that cross cut ethnolinguistic affiliation. This paper explores alternative
accounts for observed source-specifie occurrences by explicitly recognizing different behavioral
correlates potentially reflected in obsidian disposition patterns. These results indicate levels of
sociocultural complexity not anticipated by many models of hunter-gatherer societies. (37)

arbiter is the archaeological record. The best archaeological experiments are, for the most part,
hewristic—they teach us what to look for. In other sciences, experiments serve directly as ulti-
meate arbiter. Most archaeological experiments are of limited utility or trivial because they are
mevther designed to provide information relevant to testing hypotheses against the archacologi-

The Myth of the Given.
Agessi argues, contra many philosophers of science including those most popular among

archaeologists, that epistemology is vital and fundamental to scientific research: verificationism
per se is ultimately rationally absurd. Knorr-Cetina, working within the sociology of knowledge,
shows that since “the scientific reasoner is a symbol reasoner’, espistemology—the sources of

Skeletal Biology of a 17th-Century Rhode Island Indian Cemetery.

The controlled excavation of an entire mid-17th-century Indian cemetery from the northeast-
ern U.S. provides investigators with a rare opportunity to assess morbidity, mortality, and
paleodemographic patterns during a transitional stage in history. Early ethnographic reports sug-
gest that Indians in the Rhode Island region were spared from the first wave of devastating
epidemics in AD 1616-1618 that affected other New England Native populations. The temporal
placement of this cemetery is ideal for assessing the immunological status of these Indians in
relation to introduced and endemic diseases. {13}

Hunter-Gatherer Mobility Strategies and Regional Archaeology.

The relationship between hunter-gatherer mobility and land-use patterns was examined from
ethnographic data. Implications for the formation of archaeological sites are discussed, and cur-
rent methods of hunter-gatherer settlement reconstruction are criticized, It is argued that a
method for detecting different types of hunter-gatherer systems lies in understanding the way in
which different mobility strategies are implemented in a region over long spans of time, primar-
ily in terms of the degree of redundancy or variability of occupation and particular associations
of lithic reduction strategies. Taking geomorphic processes into account, the method was
implemented on the surface archaeology of the Carson Sink, Nevada. (25)

Spurious and Real Relationships of Field and Laboratory Data in Fire Effects
Studies.

Field test plots, post-wildfire evaluations, and laboratory tests have been developed as re-

Park Service studies in recent years have addressed some of the basic issues and have yielded
useful information, in what aspects are research conclusions spurious or real?’ What are we look-
ing for when these data-gathering activities are developed? The human use of fire in the New
World during ancient or modern times can be a subject for archaeological inquiry, using data and

‘ Palynological Investigation of Grave Sediment from a 17TH-Century Narra-

Systematic palynological testing of the majority of |7th-century Indian graves at RI-1000 con-
firmed the assumption that pollen in exposed New England archaeological contexts is best pre-
served in sediments adjacent to metal artifacts. At RI-1000, preservation was better next to brass
artifacts than next to iron artifacts. Considerable variation in pollen content was noted among
the graves. Some may be due to season of burial, but most seems best attributed to differences in
plant materials used for grave linings. {13}

The appropriate application of a measure of diversity depends on archaeological concerns and

Predictive Modeling vs. Sampling: Perspectives from Research and

Coincident with the rise of predictive modeling and sampling within the framework of CRM,
the distinction between the two has become peculiarly muddled. This represents an acute prob-
lem, since the one does not necessarily imply the other, and the two actually address entirely
different problems. This paper attempts to clarify and explain the importance of maintaining
that distinction, and examples of the use (and misuse) of hoth concepts from the vantage points
of archaeological research and legal compliance are provided. (38)

Theoretical Issues Regarding Site Catchment Analysis and Hunter-Gatherer
Site Locational Decisions.

Hunter-gatherer settlement systems are analyzable relative to resource accessibility from
inhabited loci. Site catchment is the implied analytical tool. However, ethnographically observed
hunter-gatherer behavior does not support any specific definition of travel-distance limits for
exploitation territories; it only suggests that opumum survival conditions rarely accompany a
given inhabited locus and that amplitudes of peoples’ ranging through various available habitats
differ. To operationalize the concept of “settlement choice”, it is advantageous to realize that
ecological principles and ethnographic observations imply structures of opportunity and risk,
both of which concepts are fundamental to theories about human decisionmaking. {15}

Implementing Research Goals in Prehistoric Study Units.

One important aspect of the Resource Protection Planning Process is developing goals and
operating plans. Research goals need to be implemented in the operating plan in terms of models
that are testable and replicable and which articulate with the scale at which planning decisions
are made. This is illustrated in one study unit in which the highest-priority goal seeks to deter-
mine whether a correlation exists between landform, site function, and season of occupation.
This goal was implemented through use of a general site locational model. Results suggest that
the model has promise for accomplishing this research goal and is a rational basis for making
planning decisions. |19)

Unreveling Cause and Effect in Changing Wood Use in the Dolores Area.

Wood use for fuel and construction in two localities was compared against three models: no
change through time, change due to local resource depletion, and change due to climatic factors.
As quantified either by number of occurrences or absolute frequency of species, strong evidence
was found for change through time, and the relative merits of the depletion versus the climatic
change hypotheses are discussed. This is accomplished by proposing and provisionally testing

A Quantitative Study of Architectural Attributes from Selected Anasazi Sites.

Architectural characteristics of selected Anasazi archaeological sites, with recognized or sus-

Cluster Analysis created three groups representing Bonito phase, McElmo phase, and generalized |
Northern San Juan Anasazi architectural characteristics. Sites with suspected Chacoan character:
istics group with the Chacoan McElmo phase cluster or the Northern San Juan Anasazi cluster.
Principal Components Analysis suggests that variation between clusters is primarily due to kiva

rts.

Two kinds of chert sources were investigated in the Perigord (SW France): those presently
observed (contemporary) and those quarried during the Paleolithic {Pleistocene}. Locational dif-
ferences between the two confounded estimates for the movements of artifacts. A third type of
source resolves these differences and helps predict the places where Pleistocene sources should
be sought. Synthetic sources, products of the spatial analysis of contemporary sources, estimate
the availability of cherts throughout the region. Synthetic sources identify the geographic zona-
tien of chert resources within the Perigord that helps explain the transport of implements and
the locations of Paleolithic sites. (9)

Maximum Settlement Size as an Index of Socippolitical Complexity,

Archaeologists have viewed maximum settlement size as a binary index of complexity, with
systems characterized as either urban or non-urban. This view of settlement, derived from ethno-
legscal concern with rural-urban systems, overlooks the original formulation of such systems as
comtinuums rather than categories. In fact, settlement size correlates with incremental increase
m complexity. A cross-cultural index of sociopolitical complexity was calibrated and applied to

An Examination of the “Vacant Quarter” Hypothesis in the Northern Lower

Several researchers have recently argued that portions of the Mid-South comprised a so-called

lations ceased to occupy fortified towns and ceremonial centers in the affected area and new
population centers grew up elsewhere. The late prehistoric and protohistoric portion of the

this hypothesis, It is shown that the “vacant quarter" is more apparent than real. (5!

y An intensive survey of the Naranjo Drainage in Guatemala began in 1983, The results high-
in lighted here indicate that during the Early Preclassic small hamlets were scattered throughout
a the area of the survey, up to 15 km inland. The rise of large settlements with public architecture
occurs in the Middle Preclassic and is closely linked to a poorly understood Olmec presence.
The strong coincidence of Conchas and Ocos ceramics at these centers suggests that the Ocos
style is a social marker during the Middle Preclassic and not a temporal indicator of the Early

Speculations as to the origin of these jaspers refer both to local and distant sources. Neutron

resulted. In contrast, the California culture area possessed a richer and more varied resource base
more typical of global patterns. Models constructed for marginal hunter-gatherers were reviewed
and tested against ethnographic and ethnohistoric data drawn from the Sierra Miwok and Yokuts
of central California. These groups had greater organizational complexity and are probably more
typical of the real hunter-gatherer adaptation. Particular attention is given to the relationship
between the evolution of social networks and subsistence strategies. (37)

Geomorphic Setting of Archaeological Sites, Southern Willamette Valley,
Oregon.
The landscape of a region commonly consists of several geomorphic surfaces of different ages.
A geomorphic surface is a mappable unit of the landscape which includes a variety of landforms
having a common history. A single geomorphic surface, therefore, may contain a range of micro-
environments, and the microenvironments present on the geomorphic surface today may have
been different in the past. In the southern Willamette Valley, the distribution of sites on geo-
morphic surfaces is not random, but suggests that certain geomorphic positions were selected. .
The potential for and problems concerning a time-dependent geomorphic model of site location
are discussed. (24)

An Early Archaic Pit-House Structure in the Hanna Basin, South-Central |
Wyoming.
During the 1983 field season, archaeologists from Mariah Associates, Inc,, uncovered the
burned remains of a 5000-year-old pit-house structure in the Hanna Basin in south-central
Wyoming. The structure was occupied during the altithermal climatic episode. Floor features,
architectural remnants, artifacts, and biological remains yielded new and significant clues
regarding settlement and subsistence during this period. This paper explores the pit-house with
its associated features in detail and discusses data analysis. |10)

ae Radar Imagery and Archaeology in the Egyptian and Sudanese
ara,
The November 1981 Columbia shuttle mission produced radar imagery of the Eastern Sahara
in southern Egypt and Northern Sudan. Preliminary interpretation by USGS and JPL scientists
identified previously unrecognized, extensive drainage systems beneath the nearly featureless
desert surface. In September 1982 and October 1983, geomorphic evidence of the buried rivers
and related archaeological sites was recovered. This fieldwork demonstrated the widespread
existence of Middle Paleolithic sites and Terminal Paleolithic/Neolithic industries, with some
limited late Acheulean as well. Artifacts have been recovered from waterlaid gravels, and sites
are associated with drainage channels. A long, hyperarid period, suggested by the absence of late
Paleolithic sites, is not also apparent in the geomorphic record. {16)

| Late Pleistocene and Holocene Columbia Drainage Fluvial Processes and their
Effects on Prehistoric Settlement and Subsistence.

From the viewpoint of prehistorically important environmental determinants, the Columbia
River drainage system is distinguished by its large areal extent and topographic relief, its abund-
ant water supply, and the productivity of its salmon resource. Although most archaeological
myestigations conducted over the last 55 years have been along the Columbia and its main
tributary, the Snake River, only a rudimentary, localized alluvial chronology presently exists.
Through examination of the climatic and hydrologic controls within the Columbia drainage
system, it is suggested that late Pleistocene and early Holocene near-riverine landscapes of the
Columbia and Snake rivers responded differently to changing climate, {24}

Human Sacrafice and Adaptation.

Human sacrificial practices documented in three prehistoric Mesoamerican cultural groups
were examined trom an information-theoretic point of view. Kinds of information conveyed to
the observer through such sacrificial rites and system-serving ways in which this information is

sacrifice in Mesoamerica are then used to construct a general model describing cultural situa-
tions in which such sacrificial practices are most likely to occur. (39)

the Hoko River Rockshelter, features were identified as discrete, primary deposits representing a

volume comprise the variables used to discriminate feature types. These variables were analyzed
through the use of cluster analysis, SYMAPs, isometric maps, and ethnographic records. The
results provide a framework for classifying features into functional types, thus contributing to

Problems with Modeling Intertidal Resource Use: A Case from the Northwest
Coast.

An economic model based on the assumption of maximum returns for minimum energy
expenditure was applied to data on intertidal resources obtained from a Northwest Coast site,
the Hoko River Rockshelter. The model failed to accurately rank species or predict their ex-
pected frequency of occurrence except in the cases of the most and the least important species.
Cultural factors, derived from ethnographic analogy, were used to explain the poor fit of the
model Important factors not incorporated in the model include cultural preferences and taboos
concerning species and collection localities, as well as ownership of collection areas and the
procurement of species in large quantities for special social events. (35)

Cemeteries and People: The Spatial Arrangement of Mississippian Mortuary
and Habitation Areas.

The spatial arrangement of habitation and mortuary areas provides much otherwise unobtain-
able information on American Bottom (Illinois! Mississippian culture. The location of elite
cemeteries within large sites, such as Cahokia, supports inferences about rank differentiation
based on artifacts. Social and geographic distance, as measured from the most important posi-
tions in society and in sites, respectively, are congruent. In addition, the positioning of nonelite
cemeteries with respect to small communities was related to the degree of regional social inte-
gration. Changes in cemetery location accompanied a | 4th century AD dissolution of the socially

Regional Variations in Rural American Culture: A Distinctly Archaeological

The archaeological record from historical sites contains abundant information on regional
variants of American culture. Site layout, architecture, and dispersed "sheet refuse” distributions
associated with 35 eastern Texas farmsteads convey information about both locally and region-
ally distinet behaviors related ro use of living space, foodways, and other Variables. Many of the
activities specifically responsible for such patterning are either unrelated to “quick time” ethno-

examined and tested by attempting to correlate changes in blade technology with major culcural

divisions and/or climatic episodes. The collections used in the study were excavated by F. Bordes.

The Inception of Agriculture in the Mediterranean: A Fresh Interpretation,

The traditional model of agricultural dispersal throughout the Mediterranean Basin was
revised in the light of recent evidence. It is argued that elements of an agricultural and herding
economy spread rapidly westward from the Near East about 6000 BC. A marked contrast exists
between the east and west Mediterranean in the subsequent development of a Neolithic way of
life, which may be partly explained by differences in the nature of the indigenous Mesolithic
adaptations in these two regions. (2)

Component III (ca. 3000-1500 BP) fauna are extensive. Component II postdates Fladmark’s hypoth-

The Development of the Plumbate Pottery Industry. .

This paper defines the spatial and temporal origins of the plumbate pottery industry and
describes some aspects of its development. The source of plumbate raw materials was on the |
cbastal plain of southern Mesoamerica, near the Chiapas-Guatemala border. The earliest variety,
Guayabal, is stylistically and compositionally distinct from the more well-known San Juan and
Tohil plumbate. Its occurrence is apparently restricted to the littoral zone near the mouth of the
Rio Naranjo. During the Late Classic period, the volume of production of plumbate increased
dramatically, and some workshops began to specialize in a limited range of vessel categories. The
San Juan and Tohil sources were opened up during this period as well. (21)

retical expectations generated by information theory or to the results of studies of black-on-

about the regional organization of the Hohokam. |36!

Gimme Shelter: The Stones in Anasazi Building Technology.

As Anasazi architecture increased in complexity, the energy requirements for building and
maintaining the facilities also increased. These energy requirements relate directly to the con-
straints of the existing technology. In exploring these constraints, It was necessary to determine
what portion of the technology was used in facility construction. A microwear analysis of one

| aspect of the Dolores Anasazi technology, the lithic tool kit, indicated an increasing proportion

used for construction and maintenance of facilities. This changing proportion viewed relative to |

overall lithic production cost is used as an index of relative energy expenditure in the overall

Garden Hunting and Anasazi Game Procurement: Perspectives from Dolores.

A garden hunting model has recently been proposed for Anasazi game procurement. This

| model identifies the principal locus of game procurement as fields, gardens, and their immediate
environs. The rationale is that garden areas would have been characterized by higher than aver-
age diversities and densities of animal species. A second argument is that exploitation of these
species would have reduced crop destruction. Investigations of the Dolores Archaeological Pro-
gram are providing an opportunity to examine the validity of this model. This has required some
rethinking of concepts as well as the development of test implications. (18)

The Basketmaker-to-Pueblo Transition on Northern Black Mesa.

The Basketmaker-to-Pueblo transition represents one of the most significant and complex
sssucs in Southwestern prehistory. Data from a large caine of excavated sites on northern Black
Mesa, Anzona document changes associated with this transition. During Basketmaker II times, a
maxed subsistence strategy emerged, based on corn farming and exploitation of wild resources,
that increased productivity and reduced uncertainty. This pattern remained essentially un-
changed during the subsequent Puebloan occupation. The earliest Puebloan sites, however,
exhibit markedly different architectural and morphological patterns. In view of the continuity in
subsistence strategies, it is argued that these changes reflect alterations in organizational com-
ponents of adaptive systems. (18)

with site function. The large proportion of points made of exotic materials during certain periods

Stating postulates concerning the nature of lithic assemblages, five factors accounting for lithic

sphere. Each factor is discussed and expected effects on lithic assemblages are modeled and

Artifacts recovered from the plow zone and from a sub-plow zone pit suggest that some of the
floodplain occupations were contemporaneous with the ridgetop mounds. (5)

Pierce, Christopher (Desert Research Institute)
Analysis of Cooking Stones from a Late Period Chumash Village.

Ethnographic and archaeological information strongly suggests that cooking with heated
stones, as practiced by many Native Americans, included the selection of particular rock types
for use in specific cooking activities. Experiments with heated stones show that this selection
was probably influenced by differences in the thermal properties of the rock types employed.
The distributional patterns of fire-altered rocks and other cultural materials recovered from a
village site in the central Santa Monica Mountains seem to indicate that dietary differences
existed between members of separate status groups within Chumash society. (11)

The Effect of Forest Fires on Archaeological Sites.

During the summer of 1977, the "Radio Fire” near Flagstaff, Arizona and the "La Mesa Fire” near
Santa Fe, New Mexico burned over 19,000 acres of land. Both fires were in areas of high archaeo-
logical site density and more than 200 specific sites were burned. A number of sites were tested
later to determine whether they had been affected by fire itself and firefighting activites. In
general, effects by burning were not severe, The greatest impacts were caused by heavy equip-
ment used in fire suppression and by fire crews during mop-up operations. Fire effects were found
to be generally restricted to the surface and upper few inches of ground surface. Artifacts were
blackened, often had a residue deposited on them, and were cracked by heat. Construction stones
were spalled. Heat alterations of surface artifacts did adversely affect potential for thermolumi-
nescence and obsidian hydration dating. (1)

Evaluation of Criteria for Use in the Analysis of Chert Artifacts from the
Munsungun Lake Formation, Maine. i

Five criteria relate source outcrops of chert to archaeological artifacts: geological mapping of
source areas; hand specimen identification; petrographic analysis; mineralogy; and chemical
analysis. This approach established a hierarchy by which artifacts may be identified as having
originated in the Munsungun Lake region of northern Maine. Used singly, the second, third, and
fourth criteria illustrate the uniqueness of the cherts. Used together, they allow confident identi-
fication. Chemical analyses reinforce the other criteria, but are more expensive to obtain than
the other methods. (9)

Sculpture: Reflector of Culture.

From the pre-Classic through the Early Classic, stone sculpture is a significant feature of the
cultures of the Pacific Piedmont and Coast of Guatemala and Chiapas. Its style, form, and con-
tent reflect the rapid growth and increased complexity of the region. Combined with studies of
more traditional artifact types, the analysis of stylistic and iconographic attributes of sculpture
provide the archaeologist with another valuable source of information on regional development,
diversity, and interregional contact and influence. This paper discusses the sculptural traditions
which were part of the cultural development of the region. (21)

Sex and Status Among the Maya: Evidence from Prehistoric Burials.

Several authors have explored the possibility that Maya economic or political alliances were

but complementary information on the status of Maya women is available from burial assem-
blages. Data already compiled from 1009 Maya burials are examined in conjunction with newly
published burial data for evidence of male/female status distinctions, changes in female status
through time, and contrasts between the burial assemblages of central Peten females and those

ASCA and a Living Conservation Ethic.

Unlike other national archaeological societies, ASCA has an organizing principle that cross-
cuts all of archaeology. Where other societies are concerned primarily with technical problems,
professionalism, field work, or other issues, ASCA is concerned with conservation of archaeolog-
ical resources. This idea is underdeveloped in the field today, but is pertinent to developing a
coherent archaeological ethic for the future. From a conservation perspective, otherwise dispar-
ate issues such as student training, ethics, Srtifact curation, and standards for work in other
countries are brought into a single evaluative framework. In a time of professional and intellec-
tual fragmentation, archaeology badly needs a coherent ethic. (Plenary Session)

Prehistoric Mortuary Ceremonialism in the Southern Plains: The Wylie Focus
Pits of North-Central Texas.

Large prehistoric pit structures, characteristic of the Wylie focus of north-central Texas, have
tong been puzzling as regards age and function. Recent excavations of two such pits indicate an
age of construction around AD J, an age at least one millenium earlier than previously sus-
pected. Evidence suggests that the pits functioned as mortuary monuments to high-status per-
sons. This pattern may represent an attenuated expression of eastern United States "Woodland"

Time and Demography: Methodological Issues of the Contact Period in North
America.

The multidisciplinary nature of the period of European contact in North America has had
positive and negative consequences on archaeological treatment of the period. While documen-
tary sources provide additional and important data sets, these sources have been used nearly to
the exclusion of the archaeological record. Behind this approach is the assumption that the
archaeological record is incomplete relative to the historic record. Consequences of this approach
and assumption were considered in relation to two methodological issues: time of European
contact and archaeological estimates of population, Intellectual origins and examples of both
issues are given, and alternative approaches are suggested. || 2)

An Approach to Dating Surface Lithic Collections from Central Panama.

A survey by the “Proyecto Santa Maria” in Central Pacific Panama has recorded 370 sites to
date, more than half of which are represented by surface lithic collections only. The need to
place these aceramic sites in a temporal framework prompted an attempt to construct a lithic
chronology for the region, Utilizing radiocarbon dated assemblages from Central Panama sites
spanning the time from 5000 BC to AD 1000 and surface collections |assigned dates based on

dating surface lithic remains with varying degrees of specificity. (29)

Mortuary Treatment and Social Differentiation at Casas Grandes, Chihuahua,

Relatively few studies of social complexity through analyses of mortuary data have been
attempted within the Greater Southwest since large buria] populations are rare. Excavations at
Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico produced a sample of 576 burials dating between the 12th
and 14th centuries. Social complexity was investigated at Casas Grandes by analyzing a series of
burial attributes, including location and type of grave tacility, method and technique of corpse
processing and disposal, and kinds of associated grave goods. Analysis defined several possible
dimensions of social differentiation as indicated by covarying attributes of mortuary treatment.

A Brief History of the New Melones Archaeological Project, 1968-1980.

Between 1968 and 1980, government personnel and contractors undertook more than 25 sep-
arate studies of historic and archaeological resources, comprising nine phases of field and archi-
val work, in the New Melones Dam and Reservoir project area of the central Sierra Nevada
foothills in Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties, California. Approximately 682 cultural properties
were documented; of these, 62 Indian sites and 27 historic non-Indian sites were tested or exca-
vated extensively. By the end of 1980, a large corpus of archaeological data remained to be
analyzed and reported, and additional fieldwork was needed at significant sites jeopardized by
reservoir filling and related developments. Accordingly, early in 1981, the federal government
programmed a tenth and final phase of archaeological work at New Melones Reservoir. (26)

Diversity, Variation and Selection.

Diversity is a perceived pattern in variation. Measures of diversity seek to integrate two de-
scriptive statistics: the number of discrete members present in a data set and their relative
abundances, Variation, as a precondition to diversity, is ordered by natural selection. Selection
may maintain, increase, or reduce specific variant forms, yielding different patterns of diversity.
Variation is presumed to be generated randomly with respect to selection; hence, natural selec-
tion is the only fore* ordering diversity patterns. Proper analysis of changing patterns of diver-
sity may give insight into the specific forces controlling cultural evolution. ||!

Symbolism in Tiwanaku and Alto Ramirez Phases of Northern Chile: The

From the archacological material recovered at several sites in Tarapaca, Azapa, Vitor, and

pan-Andean scope. This was part of a political and economic system based on the circum-Titi-
kaka area (Pukara-Chiripa-Early Tiwanaku) since early times (ca. 800 BC), even before the Tiwan-
aku expansion. The symbolic and ontologic meaning of the sacrificer is therefore further ex-
plored, representing for the Alto Ramirez and Tiwanaku societies a key element in the ideology
of complementarity and Andean reciprocity. (32)

A Model for Inter-Regional Exchange During the Historic Contact Period.

Many archaeological studics of historical contacts between Indians and Europeans have

which provide insights into the contact situation, This paper proposes that Historic period arti-
facts cannot be understood when divorced from their historical, cultural, and ecological contexts.
Materials excavated from a 17th-century Narragansett Indian cemetery provide a case study for
developing an approach to account for the complexity of interactions. Evidence suggests the
existence of strong Narragansett craft specialization traditions, which may have provided them
with opportunities for entrepreneurial behavior involying exchanges with Europeans and other

Neolithic Hunters? A New View of Vinca Subsistence Economy.

The subsistence economy of the Middle-Late Neolithic Vinéa culture of southeastern Europe
is usually thought to be based on agriculture and stockbreeding emphasizing cattle and pigs. The
difficulties of agriculture in the plains north of the Danube and the heavy reliance of local early
Neolithic groups on cattle might suggest a largely pastoral, cattle-herding economy during Vinca.
These expectations are contradicted by preliminary faunal evidence from Opovo, a Vinéa village
site in this region. Here, wild species provided virtually all of the meat, and grain may have been
cultivated. A more complex view of Vinéa subsistence economy must now be taken. (2!

Late Pleistocene Mastodonts of North America.

Recently completed or ongoing excavations in the central Midwest seck to understand the
taphonomics of Mammut americanum sites. Combined with the temporal/spatial distribution of
localities and with reports of previous investi@tions, these focus on the paleobiology of the
American mastodont. During the late Pleistocene (Rancholabrean Land Mammal Age, commenc-
tg ca. 400,000 BP), mastodonts occurred from Alaska to Mexico and from the Pacific to the
Atlantic coasts. By the terminal Pleistocene (ca. 12-11,000 BP), mastodonts were concentrated
around the Great Lakes and along the Atlantic coast. In the Great Lakes region during the latest
Pleistocene, mastodonts are usually associated with biota indicating coniferous forest habitat: in
marginal areas, associated biota indicate open coniferous, open mixed coniferous and deciduous,
or open deciduous, woodland. Mastodonts typically occur as single jor several) individuals in
bogs and less typically but abundantly in artesian spring deposits. The geological and biological
trameworks of mastodont sites are variable, as are mastodonts themselves, but patterns appear
which point to mastodont diet, behavior, evolution, and extinction, as well as to the natural
patterning of mastodont remains. (27) |

Intrasite Structural Analysis Using Semivariograms.
This paper examines the use of the semivariogram (the intrinsic function of regionalized vari- .
able theory) as a representation of the spatial density structure of artifacts within an archacolog-
ical site. It is shown that this function can be used to gauge the spatial continuity and isotropic
nature of a variable and as an indicator of the zone of influence around sample data points, The
theoretical background of this statistic is discussed, and its archaeological application demon-
strated through the use of both computer-simulated and actual site data. (30)

Sherd Diversity and the Formation Processes of Mogollon Pueblo Room Fills.
The nature of room fills in published Mogollon pueblo site reports is usually problematic.
This paper reports several quantitative analyses, emphasizing diversity of pottery (sherd) types,
that seek to illuminate the formation processes of these deposits. Although sample size is the
strongest determinant of pottery diversity, some traces of formation processes can be discerned,

The Geomorphic Background to Prehistoric Settlement at Pinon Canyon,
Colorado. :
Ancient landscapes and the late Quaternary stratigraphy of a 380-square-mile semi-arid :
catchment of southeastern Colorado were investigated in summer of 1983 as part of an interdis-
ciplinary CRM study funded by 1AS-Denver. Geomorphologic studies were directed toward both
elucidating prehistoric environments and establishing locational parameters for predicting site
distributions. Early reconnaissance suggested that monitoring and dating of channel changes and
alluvial fills was an optional strategy for examining changing environments and occupational
strategies in complementary perspective. Preliminary radiometric results show that presently
incised arroyo fills are relatively recent, mid-Holocene, or later, but that major differences in ;
Holocene channe! dynamics account for differential settlement as well as preservation between
the principal drainages in the catchment. {17}

Sand Spring: A Lithic Workshop on the High Lava Plains of Central Oregon,
Test excavations of the Sand Spring Site revealed two Archaic components separated by a
thick layer of Newberry pumice deposited some 1600 years ago. X-ray fluorescence sourcing
showed that obsidian from the site was obtained from the nearby Quartz Mountain obsidian
quarries. Statistical analysis of the site debitage and debitage produced experimentally provide
insight into stoneworking and biface manufacture in the northern Great Basin. The site analysis
p ‘ides a useful approach for understanding quarrying and tool production in a region where

Artifact Pattern Recognition at the Nicoll House, Suffolk County, New York.

This paper tests Stanley South's Carolina artifact pattern of immigrants of English origin in
colonial United States, He used a bimodal t-test to predict the data in eight artifact categories
with a 95% chance of probability. This pattern was compared to the Nicoll's House, Suffolk

CLASSIC MIMBRES ARCHITECTURAL DYNAMICS.

Recent intensive archaeological excavations at the NAN Ranch nuin, a large Classic Mimbres
period pueblo in the Rio Mimbres Valley, provided new information on the dynamics of room
block development, room maintenance, and abandonment. Using information gathered over the
past five seasons, it is possible to define Mimbres household composition, room use patterns,
document evidence of room restoration, remodeling, and, in certain instances, trace the realign-
ment of room suites and note sequences of room abandonment. These findings have a significant
bearing on previous concepts of Classic Mimbres pueblo behavior, {18!

The Mississippian Adaptive Niche in the Georgia Piedmont.

It has been suggested that much of the variation in Mississippian settlement patterns can be
explained by reference to the availability and distribution of suitable horticultural! soils and
aquatic resources. Unlike the Mississippi Valley, where these important resources are found in
close juxtaposition, favored horticultural soils and aquatic resources often have a complementary
distribution in the Georgia Piedmont. These environmental differences dictated a somewhat
meodified settlement strategy for Mississippian peoples of the Piedmont. In this light, variability
w= the use and function of excavated sites in an archaeologically recognized Mississippian society
ot the Georgia Piedmont is examined. (5)

Enculturation as a Prcess in the Formation of Lithic Assemblages.

Variation in lithic materials resulting from processes of enculturation are seldom considered

errors, but that they make more frequent errors and may contribute disproportionately to the

The Sican Metallurgy and Interaction Sphere.

Recent fieldwork in Batan Grande on the Peruvian north coast documented 17 arsenical bronze
smelters dating to Middle and Late Sican (ca. AD 900-1200). They not only represent the earliest
identified smelters of this metal in Peru but also attest to the scale and intensity of production
by AD 1000. For example, size and shape variability and quantity of “double-T copper money’
from Middle Sican funerary contexts are comparable to those from contemporary coastal Ecuador-
ian cultures. The broader implications of these findings for characterization of the Sican culture,
as well as the latter's relationship to Peruvian north highland |source of arsenical ore! and coastal
Ecuadorian cultures, are discussed. |32)

Forager Mobility and Technological Organization.

Functional requirements of activities do not alone explain variability in the technologies of
forager groups. Rather, they are one among a larger set of factors that determine how technolo-
gies are organized within cultural systems. Failure to consider these factors can impair interpre-
tations of prehistoric behavior based on analysis of artifact assemblages. One promising avenue
of research involves the relationship between technology and settlement mobility. Ethnographic
evidence shows that systematic differences in technological organization occur with variability
in forager mobility. The implications of this research for archaeology are far-reaching, and they
deserve careful future study. (20)

The Effects of Variable Edge Angles on the Process of Microwear Formation.

A study was conducted to evaluate the relationship between tool edge angles and the process
of microwear formation. A series of flint wedges with a range of edge angles was manufactured
using a rock saw. Experiments were performed in which activity, force, length of stroke, worked
material, angle of tool with respect to worked surface, and lithic raw material were held con-
stant. By holding constant these variables and only varying tool edge angle, we were able to
monitor the efféct of edge angle on microwear formation. The results of the study are presented
and implications for interpreting the formation of microwear damage are suggested. (7)

Cultural Resources of the Fremont National Forest, South-Central Oregon.

An increasingly rigorous, scientifically based cultural resource management program has
inventoried more than 400 prehistoric and 150 historic sites. Preliminary analyses indicate a
primarily seasonal use of this upland periphery of the northwestern Great Basin, although evi-
dence suggests the presence of winter villages in four localities, with possible Albert Lake, Sur-
prise Valley, and ethnographic Klamath-Modoc affiliations. Projectile point evidence indicates
use of the Sycan Marsh area as early as 11,000 to 8000 BP, with use of other areas beginning
between 9500 and 8000 BP. Integration of research questions into future management activities
is discussed, (34)

Diversity Measures in Intrasite Spatial Analysis.

Traditional spatial analysis measures the association of artifact classes, assuming that co-
occurrence of individual classes reflects behaviorally meaningful relations. Yet, actualistic stu-
dies show that complex site formation processes result in the accumulation of many classes in
given locations that are related only in their context of disposal. Examination of the content
diversity among artifact concentrations from two Upper Paleolithic sites (Pincevent and Le Fla-
geolet) suggested that this may be a better way to measure basic structural characteristics of
sites related to multiple formation processes. Two diversity profiles were identified in analyzing
these two sites. One is contextually related to hearth features and represents repeated bouts of
material deposition into a limited area. The second profile reflects a more limited refuse disposal
mode in functionally specific parts of the sites. 1)

New Light on Early Neolithic Adaptations in the Near East: Excavations at |
‘Ain Ghazal, Jordan. .
Many modern theories attempting to explain the Neolithic view food production as having |
gccurred within a stressful, marginal environment. Recent excavations at ‘Ain Ghazal, Jordan, a |
Prepottery Neolithic B site, produced data that required reevaluation of some basic concepts. |
Particularly significant is ‘Ain Ghazal’s location in a favorable environment with access to |
abundant resources. The site, three times larger than contemporary Jericho, has yielded abund- |
ant data, including some of the earliest known human statues. This paper summarizes these :
tendings and discusses how ‘Ain Ghazal will help to better understand the complex processes
involved in man’s transition to food production. (2)

Some Expectations About Hunter-Gatherer Foraging in the Great Basin.
General models, clearly linked to theory about how and why behavioral change occurs, can
assist with various levels of explanation. Among other things, theoretical models can identify
expectations about the form and content of an archaeological record frequently so fragmented
that it is composed largely of negative evidence. Here, simple cost/benefit data were cast in a
theoretical framework of evolutionary ecology to develop expectations about foraging in the
Great Basin. Topics illustrating this perspective include the inception of pine nut utilization and
| the potential for a year-round, narrow-spectrum hunting adaptation to have developed in the
| Holocene Great Basin. (28)

Planning vs. Crisis Management.
Massachusetts adopted a state preservation plan for both historic buildings and archaeological
sites in 1979. This plan was developed as a pilot study under the preliminary resource protection
planning process |RP3) outlined by the National Park Service. Since 1979, the Massachusetts
plan has evolved in different directions than the formal planning process finally advocated by
the National Park Service. Although the structure of planning differs, the benefits of strong state
planning for preservation is a fundamental point of agreement between the National Park Service
and Massachusetts programs. Implementation of the Massachusetts plan has increased confi-
dence in decisionmaking, reduced crisis management, and allowed the building of an effective
preservation constituency. (19)

Lithic Industrial Variability at New Melones Reservoir.
Analysis of lithic assemblages from two prehistoric sites excavated in 198] defined two pre-

which by their nature or abundance Suggest unique trade and/or territorial patterns. The indus-
try from 04-Cal-§-347 is an obsidian-based assemblage domifiated by Bipoints and dating between
Elko and Rosegate times. The assemblage from 04-Cal-S-286, older than 3570+170 BC, contains
large percussion-flaked bifaces and is dominated by various scraper types. Neither industry has
been described previously in the archaeology of the central Sierra Nevada foothills. Correlations
with other areas were attempted, and new territorial and trade models are posited to account for
the observed differences. (26)

Anadromous Fish and Social Organization on the Columbia Plateau: The
Ethnographic Scene.
Three types of societies within the Columbia Plateau can be recognized ethnographically:
those in normal seasons with an abundance of anadromous fish within their own territory; those
with limited access to such resources through possessing fisheries of but meager productivity,
through fishing as visitors in the country of more richly endowed neighbors, or through conven-
ient barter; and those with essentially no anadromous fish in their customary food supply. The
social organizational correlates of these three resource environments are suggested and con-
trasted to the extent the ethnographic data allow. Possible archaeological implications of these

the production of foodstuffs and cotton for both internal consumption and external trade and |

Working Hardwood with Stone Tools: An Atlatl Replication.

Interesting conclusions were reached with regard to stone tool edges when used on a hard.

and unretouched working edges. Some of the retouched edges were purposely retouched by
pressing them against the surface being worked; this form-fit them to the surface. The most
important unretouched edges used were fracture faces (generally the ventral/fracture face edge!

Urban geographers and others have reached tentative conclusions concerning the nature of

for authorized refuse disposal, and the general visibility of all refuse. This paper explores the
nature of littering in late 19th-century American cities, It is Suggested that research designs
which limit excavation to known, authorized disposal contexts, é.g., privies and trash pits, very
likely disallow the recovery of specific artifact assemblages representative of specific urban

Remains of a Mammuthus columbi have been recovered from a Late Pleistocene point bar of
the-Brazos River. Noteworthy are the distribution of the remains and the presence of long bones
broken when fresh. The fine sands of the point bar and the overlying clays indicate that the river
did not break or significantly distribute the bones. The presence of more fragile and complete
bones indicates that compaction and sediment creep were not the cause of disturbance and
destruction. Based on the pattern of breakage and the selection of long bones broken, it is sug-
gested that the major taphonomic agency was man. (27)

Interpreting the Stratigraphy of Northwest Coast Shell Middens.

Shell middens result from the activities of prehistoric people collecting shelled animals and
disposing of the remains in heaps. Because the shells were discarded with organic remains, animal
bones, tool fragments, and other cultural debris, every midden has a unique composition. On the
Northwest Coast, many middens are composed of the same two strata: a dark organic-rich layer
(6.7% organic matter| with 50% shell-derived carbonate and a lighter colored layer (2.9% organic
matter) with more abundant shell (75% carbonate}. The dark and light layers observed in so
many middens result from similar subsistence activities that changed at some time in the past.

Male/Female Activity Differentiation in Prehistoric Hunting Societies.

Patterning across several densely occupied living surfaces at the Peace Point Site, a rapidly

ally, the lack of spatial congruity between biface/projectile point resharpening debitage and finely
crushed bone (remains likely relate to the repair of hunting equipment and production of bone
grease/soup, respectively) led to recognition of other patterns that would be expected to monitor
role differences between men and women in hunting societies. These expectations form the basis

Primary sources of the material are limited to a relatively small area of the Blue Ridge physio-
graphic province of Maryland and Pennsylvania. Metarhyolite is easily identified by macroscopic
features, is not readily mistaken for other lithic types, and is referenced in archaeological litera-
ture dating from the 19th century. Artifacts fashioned from the material occur in Early Archaic
through Late Woodland contexts (ca, 8000 BC-AD 1600), several hundred miles from primary
sources. Analysis of geographic distributions of artifacts, frequencies of occurrence, intra-site
contexts, and the types of artifacts fashioned from metarhyolite is the basis for characterizing
the nature and extent of prehistoric trade and exchange in the region. (9}

Late Prehistoric Social Organization in the Western Mojave Desert, California.

The late prehistoric period (post-2200 BP) in the western Mojave Desert is complex and has
been extensively investigated, although results of this work is poorly represented in the litera-
ture. The social systems of the late prehistoric period exhibit complexity beyond those known
for the ethnographic period and atypical for the western Great Basin. These systems are exam-
ined diachronically and their relationship to the economic, settlement, and ecological systems
are discussed, {10)

Trends and Filters: An Examination of Pattern Recognition at the Site Level.

Archacologists are concerned with the recognition and identification of patterns in the arch-
acological record. However, patterns can always be found, and it is crucial that meaningful patt-
erns reflecting actual behavior be distinguished from “noise” resulting from post-depositional
events. This paper details the specific application of trend surface analysis to a small! site in
western New York. Several filtering techniques were utilized to smooth the data, and interpreta-
tions are permitted based on the underlying distributional patterns at the site. (30)

. ee Sample Sizes in Faunal Interpretation: Building Blocks of a Regional
ysis.

One major assumption in the zooarchaeological literature is that a large sample size of bones
(2000 or more) is required for adequate analysis. While many sites yield such quantities, the
majority of southwestern Hohokam sites do not. Zooarchaeologists in this region therefore face
the problem of basing their interpretations on relatively small sample sizes of faunal material.
This paper argues that researchers can produce more than expanded “laundry lists” from small
samples of bones. An approach emphasizing intra- and intersite variability is advocated, one
which incorporates the analysis of Hohokam faunal remains into a regional economic frame-
work. (33}

Regional Diversity and Interaction Spheres in the Northern Southwest.

Cultural diversity in the region of the San Juan Basin was investigated in the context of
environmental! diversity, resource fluctuations, and sociopolitical networks. From the Archaic
through Puebloan periods, alliance systems and interaction spheres served to link widespread
populations in production, exchange, and consumption networks of a regional scale. The evolu-
tion of these systems can be traced from egalitarian reciprocity to hierarchical management and
ultimately to collapse. {1}

ical sites. Chemical and physical weathering of coal releases microscopic particles and coal vola-

tiles which are dissolved in and transported by groundwater. The affinity of charcoal for organic

contaminants necessitates recognition of mechanisms that transport coal (C12) atoms and those

that result in admixtures of coal and charcoal. Hydrogeologic processes by which bedrock, alluv-

ial, and anthropogenic coal contaminants reach radiocarbon samples were investigated through

percolation replication experiments, groundwater dye tracing, and scanning electron microscopy.

Radiocarbon dating of several archaeological sites in the eastern United States is discussed. |16)

The Changing Role of Exchange in Hohokam Economy.

Using data from the Salt-Gila Aqueduct Project in conjunction with information from previous
studies, it was possible to systematically evaluate distributions of non-local commodities in
Hohokam habitation sites. These distributions provide evidence of significant change in systems
of exchange, beginning by the Sedentary period and continuing through the Classic period. The
development of networks centered on platform mound sites is indicated. This is associated with
evidence of increased specialization in crafts and agricultural products. Some implications for
the development of Classic period organization are examined. (36)

Diversity in Hunter-Gatherer Cultural Geography.

Only recently have archaeologists given even passing thought to the meaning of assemblage
size and assemblage diversity in the archaeological record of hunter-gatherers. Although it is
now generally agreed that these sites can be grouped along a residential-logistic continuum,
there is virtually no agreement on how these terms can be provided with operational definitions.
Too often, archaeologists view big sites as base camps, small sites as “task-specifie loci’, or [even
worse} "temporary chipping stations". This simplistic equation between assemblage size and pre-
sumed settlement functions is particularly apparent in CRM studies, but contract archaeology is
hardly the only offender, the problem pervades some of the more methodologically sophisticated
endeavors as well. This paper explores the relationship between assemblage size and assemblage
diversity, and suggests more concrete ways of linking the behaviorally viable with the archaeo-
logically visible. (1)

Correlations of Alluvial and Archaeological Stratigraphy in the Middle
Missouri Basin.
Holocene alluvial stratigraphy in the Middle Missouri River Basin is the subject of ongoing
: study. Six major episodes of erosion and sedimentation are recognized within a sequence of
alluvial fills with distinct lithologic, pedologic, and stratigraphic properties and characteristics.
Absolute and relative dating methods establish that alluvial fills are time-synchronous in drain-
7 ages of similar order or size. This chronologic and stratigraphic framework is used throughout
; the region to locate, date, and correlate buried arghaeological deposits and to explain discontin-
uities in the distribution of time-sequences of he Hntscint archaeological record. (22)

The Ethnography and Archaeology of Large Gatherings with Regard to Chaco
Canyon.
Discontinuities among projected population, quantities of faunal and ceramic remains, and
span of deposition raised the prospect of periodic large gatherings in Chaco Canyon during the
period AD 1000-1050. Limited Southwestern and Mesoamerican ethnographic information on
markets, fairs, and large ceremonial gatherings was briefly reviewed in order to assess the mater-
jalist functions and conceivable archaeological manifestations of such events. The combination
of depositional characteristics, architectural features, and the environmental necessity for the
) movement of goods in Chaco suggests that such gatherings may have been an integral part of the

This paper offers an analysis and interpretation of grave goods recovered from a mid-|7th-

European artifacts from the site yielded chronological information and also indicated the tribe's
active participation in international trading systems. Functional and contextual analyses of the
artifacts helped document the acculturation process among the Narragansetts. A study of overall]
artifact distribution patterns and individual grave Jot associations augments ethnohistorical
accounts and skeletal data to reveal some aspects of the interna] chronology and sociocultural
structure of the cemetery. (13)

Adaptive Diversity and Southwestern Populations at Contact.
During the last several decades, anthropologists have generated estimates of aboriginal popu-
lations in the Southwest at contact that are relatively low compared to other areas of the New
World where groups were sedentary and relied on agriculture. More recent research has chal-
lenged the notion of historically low population estimates both at contact and during the imme-
diately preceding protohistoric period. This paper explores the reasons behind discrepancies in
population estimates and attempts to resolve the controversy by focusing on differences in
Southwestern adaptive Strategies. It is argued that initial population reconstructions are too low |
because they do not incorporate a large number of mobile groups. (12)

surrounding the church. The church wall, which is divided into strips of ritual territory, serves ;
as a historical model of the interaction among the ayllus and provides a context for the reorgani- ,

| ized strategy and a collecting organized strategy in the winter. Summer/fall is represented by
residential moves to areas for seed gathering and hunting activities, and winter by living off

Hierarchical Decisionmaking Processes: A Systemic Model.

| In arid and semi-arid environments, climatic change such as drought is often invoked as an
explanatory model for culture change. Such models tend to be univariate in causation. This
paper argues that a systemic approach that entails hierarchical decisionmaking processes has
greater explanatory power than univariate causation models. Sociocultural systems are more
than a complex of variables directiy or indirectly related in a causal network; they all are respon-
sive to environmental limiting factors. As such, systemic variables can be ranked in order of
importance based on Liebig’s law of the minimum. (15) )

| A Reexamination of Prehistoric Exchange aetorus in Southern Arizona.

Artifacts recovered in prehistoric Southwestern sites demonstrate the long-distance move-
ments of specific types of goods into and out of the Hohokam area in southern Arizona. The
distribution of marine shell and intrusive ceramics in Southwestern sites reveals patterning in
the direction in which objects of exchange moved from source to destination. Trails documented
or reconstructed from historic and ethnographic information may have had a long history in this
urea. The place of the Salt-Gila Basin Hohokam in regional exchange networks changed through
time. A reconsideration of some of the traditionally held views of Southwestern exchange pat-
terns is indicated. (18)

ditrusion coefficients in the samples’ clay layers are equivalent in all of the artifacts studied to

mud brick, fired clay brick, and mortar samples from sites in diverse environments ranging from

Prehistorians have been largely concerned with discovering the norms of the past. Recently,
vigorous emphasis has been placed on explaining change in the norms, especially with regard to
ecological factors, For theoretical-historical reasons, there has been little paralleling emphasis on
prehistoric systems of norm violation. The material record of archaeology may shed some light
on this issue. The relationship of lithic technology to cognitive-perceptual processes suggests a
Pigetian model for the evolution of the deviant “mind”. (15)

Holocene Vegetation Changes in the North Coast Ranges, California: The
Pollen Record.

Six pollen profiles from California's North Coast Ranges provide complementary evidence of

Holocene vegetation change. Within that record, four pollen zones are equated with various
shifts in climatic conditions. The data support a warm, mid-Holocene period with temperatures
1-2° C warmer than today and the development of present-day vegetation patterns within the last

| 3000 years. Two minor, short-term fluctuations in the record are suggested as having been the
result of past fires. This climatic-vegetation variability has obvious implications for California

. prehistory, but the interrelationships between culture and environment must be explored cau-
tiously. Too frequently, archaeologists fail to evaluate the type or extent of vegetation changes
and, thereby, ultimately misrepresent the nature of prehistoric culture change. (37)

Middle Formative Household Evolution in Oaxaca, Mexico.

Intensification of Anadromous Fishing and Settlement Pattern Change in the
Northeastern United States.

Atlantic salmon and other anadromous fish became established in northeastern United States
rivers in early Holocene times, in response to a variety of geomorphological changes. The open-
ing up of this ecological niche, coupled with a decline in the productivity of other fauna, forced
human populations into competition for this important resource. This change is reflected in
increases in numbers of sites and diversity of lithic assemblages, as well as in settlement pattern
shifts in critical zones for anadromous fishing. Confounding the analysis of these patterns is the
development of “landlocked” salmon and catadromous fisheries. (23)
