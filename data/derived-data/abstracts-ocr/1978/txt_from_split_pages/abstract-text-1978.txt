, ABSTRACTS OF ORGANIZED SYMPOSIA
(1) CHANGE AND INTERACTION IN THE HOHOKAM CORE AREA. The papers discuss issues
that have been central in our evolving understanding of Hohokam prehistory. These are reviewed
in light of rapidly growing evidence on these people, evidence that is leading to significant revi-
sions of some interpretations of local prehistory. Focal points are the origin of the Hohokam,
their relationship to groups living further to the south, and processes in Hohokam cultural
change. The nature of exchange relationships that integrated Hohokam communities is iden-
tified as an emerging issue of crucial importance.
(2) FRONTIER SYSTEMS AND BOUNDARY PROCESSES: AN APPROACH TO INTER-REGIONAL
ANALYSIS. The analysis of prehistoric and historic social systems has recently shifted to in-
clude inter-site in addition to intra-site variables leading to a strong research impetus on the
regional analysis of archaeological data. A further step in understanding regional dynamics is to
open up the models used by archaeologists to permit examination of inter-regional processes
that affect regional patterns. Frontier and boundary models provide a powerful means for identi-
fying and incorporating inter-regional, social and ecological processes into our analyses. A
series of papers will discuss frontiers and boundaries as aspects of open systems in a variety of
archaeological (prehistoric and historic) contexts.
(3) SOCIAL USES OF MAYA BIOTA. Remains of plants and animals from the tropical Maya area
have presented special problems in recovery and analysis. Nevertheless, a growing corpus of
information can now be drawn upon to provide insight into a number of aspects of Maya life. The
evidence is used to reconstruct patterns of resource procurement in both coastal and intand
environments. Animal as well as human bones give a picture of nutrition and health. Studies of
shells reveal craft specialization. Trade in animal products can be documented. Both shells and
cave faunas shed light on ceremonial and ritual practices. The iconography of plants and animals
at Palenque is also discussed,
(4) DIAGNOSTICS OF THE MIDDLE HORIZON IN PERUVIAN ARCHAEOLOGY. The concept of
“Middle Horizon” in Andean archaeology has suffered from numerous ambiguities of definition
and usage since its inception as a prehistoric time unit marking the widespread and nearly syn-
chronic: appearance of certain traits loosely associated with, or attributed to, the Huari and
Tiahuanaco “complexes.” Participants in this symposium will examine one or more diagnostic
features that have been used in the past to define this highlagd-based cultural matrix and its
coastal manifestations. Particular emphasis will be given to the assessment of their continuing
validity as horizon makers. Papers may stress redefinition, refinement, and/or elimination of ex-
isting criteria, or may propose the use of new diagnostic features. The characteristics examined
will be iconographic, technological and systemic, and will be either area-wide or region-specific
in focus.
(5) CURRENT THEORY AND RESEARCH IN GREAT BASIN ARCHAEOLOGY. In recent years the
| emphasis of Great Basin archaeology has shifted away from the development and testing of
regional and inter-regional models of hunter/gatherer man-land relationships to address more
narrowly conceived problems. In some instances, this research has pursued questions develop-
ing out of previous investigations. In other instances, workers have applied theoretical or
methodological innovations to problems previously ignored or studied inadequately because
they proved particularly resistant to analysis. Symposium papers reflect both the growing diver-
sity of interests and the increasing sophistication characterizing current archaeological research
in the Desert West. Individual contributions comprise environmental studies as wel! as arch-
aeological analyses of prehistoric groups ranging from Paleoindians to food producers to
historical sites.
(7) URBAN HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES. Archaeological investiga-
tions in the American urban setting have increased in recent years. This is partly a result of the
growth in federally-mandated cultural resource assessments. Additionally, there has been a
trend within our discipline toward recognizing the importance of the entire material record, in-
cluding recent urban and industrial remains, in the elucidation of cultural patterns and pro-
cesses, The urban setting requires new techniques for finding, evaluating, excavating, and
preserving archaeological resources. Urban historical sites present unique opportunities to com-
bine documentary evidence, informant data, and material remains in broadly-based research
strategies.

(8) REGIONAL DIVERSITY ON THE HOHOKAM PERIPHERY. The detail of archaeologists’
understanding of groups living adjacent to the Gila-Salt Hohokan core area has increased drasti-
cally in recent years, This symposium reviews evidence from as far north as Flagstaff and as far
south as the region of the U.S.-Mexico border. Several. different hypotheses accounting for var-
ability in the presence of Hohokam cultural materials in these areas are discussed. Interaction
between these groups and those living in the core area may have covered the continuum from
casual contacts to strong exchange relationships. Our understanding of Hohokam is highly
dependent on correctly interpreting this interaction.
(9) RECONSTRUCTION OF SOCIAL ORGANIZATION IN NORTHERN PERU. The organizing
theme of the symposium is the way in which social organization can be reconstructed in northern
Peru, The main emphasis is on the coast, with some discussion of the highlands. The cultures
that are covered include Moche V, Chimu, and Inca. Each paper examines either a specific body
of data (ceramics, architecture and ethnohistorical records) or a particular problem (6.g., dual or-
ganization, reaction to socioeconomic stresses, imperial organization). The symposium is in-
tended as an examination of the methodology involved and the way in which the different kinds of
data can be used to cross-check each other.
(10) MAYA ECOLOGY AND AGRICULTURE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE NATURAL
SCIENCES. Reconstruction of the prehispanic Lowland Maya landscape has become a major
focus of Mesoamerican research. Study of subsistence systems, settlement patterns, and trade
networks rely, to a certain extent, on largely implicit assumptions of the distribution and nature
of prehispanic lowland tropical ecosystems. The archaeological record lacks the potential for
landscape reconstruction, except through indirect means (such as the discovery of canal or ter-
race remnants). This symposium presents the non-artifactual record from the Maya Lowlands to
provide an independent view of the environmental matrix of the prehispanic Maya. Results of
fossil pollen analysis, pedology, geomorpholoay, and other disciplines produce a rapidly expand-
ing body of knowledge that may be integrated with present archaeological research to derive
unified models of environmental interaction of the Maya Civilization.
(12) AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR CONSERVATION ARCHAEOLOGY SYMPOSIUM ON CONSERVA-
TION ARCHAEOLOGY. This symposium examines diverse aspects of cultural resource manage-
ment in North America. The symposium concludes with an examination and discussion of pro-
posed changes in federal antiquities legislation in the United States.
(13) NON-STRUCTURAL SITE DISCOVERY IN HEAVILY VEGETATED AREAS: METHODOLOGIES
AND TECHNIQUES. The papers comprising this symposium report on specific applications of
various site discovery and examination methodologies and techniques in areas of heavy vegeta-
tion, including grass, brush, and trees. Archaeologists’ ability to reconstruct and analyze past
cultural systems is directly dependent upon their ability to discover the physical remains of such
systems, In many parts of the world site discovery and examination are hindered by heavy vegeta-
tion. The effectiveness of various approaches for site discovery and examination under such con-
ditions is critically evaluated by these papers. Factors such as cost. time and equipment neces-
sary and other theoretical or practical constraints are considered.
(14) THE ANTHROPOLOGY OF EARLY HAWAII. This symposium is designed to report recent ad-
vances across a wide spectrum of method and theory in the archaeological study of the precon-
tact and early historic Hawaiian Islands. Recent and ongoing research explores problems of
chronology, ecology, technology, demography, and social/cultural evolution in the context of ex-
treme spatial isolation, mild climate, limited land area, short time sequence, and a complex
social system. Special attention has been given in recent years to the use of support disciplines
as diverse as geology, zoology, chemistry, ethnohistory, physics, and demography in studying an-
cient Hawaii.
(16) CONFERENCE ON MESOAMERICAN ETHNOHISTORY: SAHAGUN, THE MAN AND HIS
MANUSCRIPTS. This symposium will focus upon the documentary materials of the great
Mesoamerican ethnographer Bernardino de Sahagiin, who left lengthy descriptions and explana-
tions of the cultures and archaeology of ancient Mexico. It will show the relationship of these
data to the analysis and solution of both pre-Conquest and post-Contact problems. The par-
ticipants, who are from Mexico, Europe, and the U.S., have been selected to reflect a broad
coverage of the current research in the complex interdisciplinary field. Their papers will
demonstrate how the utilization of these primary sources can contribute to resolving ar-
chaeological, anthropological, and ethnographical problems.
(18) PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY IN AMERICA. Archaeology in America is supported consciously or
unconsciously by the general public, the great uninformed multitude, who faithfully pay taxes
and sponsor legislation. Historically, archaeologists have hidden themselves away from the pur-
view of the public in the ivory tower or dark recesses of an institution of higher learning, but the
22
, advent of public archaeology is forcing archaeologists to become ever increasingly accountable
for their actions and \s placing them in the public spotlight. This symposium will show how the
people of America are being informed about the findings of ongoing field and laboratory investi-
gations and how they are being involved in the day-to-day protection and conservation of the ir-
replaceable remains of America’s heritage. Suggestions for increasing public awareness will be
offered and papers will focus on the "how to” aspects of public education.
(21) LOCAL AND REGIONAL EXCHANGE SYSTEMS: NEW WORLD CASE STUDIES. Recent
studies of local and regional cultural systems have concentrated on settlement size and distribu-
tion, Significant information on systemic structure can also be generated trom detailed technical
and stylistic studies of locally produced and/or distributed items. This symposium will examine
; local and regional exchange systems based on studies of ceramics from several areas in the New
World. A variety of approaches useful in distinguishing locally produced items are presented. The
advantages of regional and site based programs of analysis are revealed.
(22) METHODOLOGICAL AND THEORETICAL ISSUES IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF NORTH-
EASTERN ARIZONA: EXAMPLES FROM BLACK MESA. The pace of archaeological research in
northeastern Arizona has quickened in the last decade with the increase in funding from con-
tracts with private companies and public agencies, The increased amount of new data, gathered
through problem-oriented research, has enabled in-depth studies that focus on: (1) substantive
issues relating to culture change in northeastern Arizona and (2) methodological and theoretical
issues of interest to the archaeological community in general, Specifically, this symposium will
focus on the evolution of procurement systems, community and settlement patterns, and a varie-
ty of methodological problems.
(23) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF EMPIRES: STUDIES OF FRONTIER EXPANSION. Despite social,
economic, and political complexity it is possible to observe similar processes operating in all
expanding political systems. Lattimore made this evident from the historical comparison of fron-
tier areas and he recognized the importance of archaeological work in these areas where histori-
cal documents are lacking or minimally useful. This symposium will present ongoing research
from historical and non-historical contexts, in the Old and New Worlds, that are helping to for-
mulate principles by which empires expand and subjugated populations adapt to that expansion,
(26) PALEO-INDIAN TO PLAINVILLE; HOLOCENE ADAPTATION IN THE TRUMAN RESERVOIR,
SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI. The papers synopsize more than a decade of research in the
ecotone straddling the Ozark Highland and the western prairies of Missouri. An interdisciplinary
research team has developed archaeological models for the 10,500-year human occupation docu-
mented for the area, as well as models for the paleoecology/biogeography of the area for the last
50,000 years. The symposium reports new work carried out since the publication of Prehistoric
man and his environments: a case study in the Ozark Highland (Academic Press 1976); work con-
ducted under auspices of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
(28) HUMAN ECOLOGY AND ADAPTIVE TECHNOLOGY AT HINDS CAVE, VAL VERDE COUNTY,
SOUTHWEST TEXAS. This symposium presents a series of studies on the human ecology and
adaptive technology of the lower Pecos River area. Hinds Cave was utilized over a 10,000-year
span by a continuum of hunter-gatherer populations. The dry cultural deposits contain
remarkably well-preserved perishable materials and provide an unusually accurate view of the
: past environment, human ecology, and adaptive technology. These studies contribute a signifi-
cant body of data pertinent to examining the adaptive strategies of pre-agricultural and non-
agricultural foragers of the desert Southwest and northern Mexico.
(29) PREHISPANIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE VALLEY OF OAXACA, MEXICO. The sym-
| posium summarizes the results of five seasons of systematic archaeological survey in the Valley
of Oaxaca. To date the work completed includes the detailed mapping and extensive surface col-
lection of Monte Alban, the ancient regional capital, as well as roughly 75% of the surface area of
the valley. The papers will deal with problems related to population transitions and socio-cultural
evolution, and changing modes of political and economic organization.
(30) PUEBLO CLIFF DWELLINGS: AN ENDURING INFORMATION SOURCE IN SOUTHWESTERN
ARCHAEOLOGY. For nearly 100 years, the Pueblo cliff dwellings of the Southwest have held the
attention of both archaeologists and the general public, This symposium documents the contin-
uing scientific interest in these phenomena, as they are approached with new questions and
research methods.
(31) FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY. Criminal investigators frequently encounter human remains in
either buried or surface locations. Usually these remains are partially or completely skeletonized.
in the past the quality of the recovery of this material has been haphazard. Difficulties in identifi-
cation of poorly recovered material and prosecution in criminal cases has given rise to an interest
23
, ,
in archaeological recovery and anthropological interpretation of human material. This sym-
posium examines this problem from anthropological and criminological perspectives and out-
lines the results of current work in this developing field.
(32) THE PALEQECOLOGY OF LOWER CENTRAL AMERICA. Intensification of archaeological
research in several regions of Lower Central America in the last decade has provided a much
more complete time-space framework for archaeologists, and simultaneously permitted explora-
tion of more complex problems dealing with human adaptation and cultural response to the
varied environmental setting of the isthmian zone. One major topic that has received recent ar-
chaeological attention in this culture area is paleoecology. Zooarchaeological and
paleobotanical studies in Lower Central America are providing much needed data on the prob-
lems and questions of ancient human ecology, prehistoric climatic and environmental changes,
food procurement and subsistence practices, resource management, and trade. The papers of the
symposium examine current paleoecological research from several aboriginal sites and regions
of Lower Central America.
(33) QUARRY SITE ACTIVITIES AND PRODUCTION ANALYSIS. Recently several papers have ex-
plored some of the interrelationships between quarry production and regional exchange of lithic
resources. This is a timely subject that may act to synthesize two important areas of ar-
chaeological research. At present, there is a critical need to address both theoretical issues and
operational procedures for future research. The strategies of quarry production analysis will be
discussed and will include the procedures on how to document production modes and their
changes in time, and how to discriminate discrete workshops in space-time. Once research is
operationalized, a number of new problems can be investigated.
(34) RECENT PALEOLITHIC RESEARCH IN THE OLD WORLD. Anthropologically-oriented ar-
chaeology has much to offer to the study of Pleistocene cultural systems in the Old World.
Gathered here are recent examples of such research, which may be grouped into three
categories: (i) reports on multi-disciplinary investigations of Paleolithic occupation sites; (2)
quantitative analyses of |ithic artifact variability (both single-site and regional studies), which
deal with systematics and the extraction of information about past human technological and sub-
sistence activities; and (3) comparative papers that look at already-published data in new ways.
Despite varying geographical and methodological foci, all the contributions involve attempts to
expand our understanding of the lifeways of Pleistocene hunter-gatherers.
(36) MODELS OF PREHISTORIC SUBSISTENCE CHANGE. The tremendous variation in human
food procurement and consumption across space and through time is a phenomenon of great
significance to those interested in explaining human behavior. Archaeologists are fortunate to be
in a strong position to make basic contributions to the understanding of long-term subsistence
change in human populations. This symposium provides examples of the variety of theoretical
| and methodological approaches available for the study of prehistoric subsistence. The papers
| demonstrate important areas of overlap between the disciplines of economics, ecology, and an-
thropology.
(37) NEW FRONTIERS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY AND ETHNOHISTORY OF THE GREATER
SOUTHWEST. Drawing on work in progress by archaeologists, ethnohistorians, and cultural
geographers, this symposium presents a cross section of new studies on the prehistory and con-
tact history of the Greater Southwest. Symposium participants combine and reconcile the pro-
cessual approach to Southwestern archaeology with the recent flood of evidence that massive
contact, both within the Greater Southwest and from outside—especially from
Mesoamerica—was a major factor in shaping Southwestern cultures.
(39) THE SHORT ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY: PROBLEMS AND DIRECTIONS. The short,
small-scale archaeological survey constitutes the bulk of contract archaeology, but has been ig-
nored as a rich data base in favor of the large-scale regional survey. This symposium concen-
trates on the research potential offered by the small contract survey. A series of research designs
| that have been employed to direct this mode of data retrieval is presented. A demonstration of
how data can be integrated into predictive settlement models is evaluated in relationship to the
biases inherent in small survey investigations, Finally, a means of communicating small survey
data—so they can be used in a theoretical research framework, as well as to provide information
required by contracting agencies and planners for the management of resources—is presented in
a mode! designed for small project reports.
(41) PALEOQETHNOBOTANICAL ROUNDTABLE: THE IDENTIFICATION AND INTERPRETATION
OF EVIDENCE FOR PALEOETHNOBOTANICAL RECONSTRUCTIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST. The
methods and models for reconstructing the patterns of plant utilization from archaeological sites
in the Southwest will be discussed by the participants of this roundtable. Evidence of
domesticated, cultivated, and non-cultivated plants will be examined from the perspective of new
24
, methods of identification, alternative models of interpretation, and directions for future research.
The importance and implications of associated botanical evidence—charcoal, pollen, seeds,
phytoliths, etc.—will be reviewed and debated by the participating paleoethnobotanists. Ques-
tions and comments from the audience are encouraged.
(42) THE CORONADO ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: RESEARCH IN THE PREHISTORY OF
EASTERN ARIZONA. The papers to be presented are the result of several years of research at
sites impacted by the construction of the Coronado Power Station near St. Johns, Arizona. The
problems of administration of a large research project are discussed, as are the research pro-
blems encountered in arbitrarily selected data samples. The results of research in Archaic settle-
ment, lithic chronology, and Puebloan settlement and ecology in the Puerco River-Little Colorado
River basin are discussed.
(43) TRACE ELEMENT ANALYSES OF CHERT: PROBLEM-ORIENTED RESEARCH. The papers in
this symposium present the results, from several years of ongoing research across the country,
of the “fingerprinting” of chert sources via various analytical techniques. in addition to the
technique and analytical parameters, the uses of the various data sets are noted, with the em-
phasis on the delineation of, or solution to, specific archaeological/geoarchaeological problems.
The emphasis of these papers is on the problems and their delineation and solution rather than
on the presentation of large amounts of technical data.
(48) CULTURAL RESOURCE INVENTORY AND THE MEASUREMENT OF UNCERTAIN IMPACTS.
The USDI Bureau of Land Management has been required by court order to produce a total of 212
Environmental Statements on its domestic livestock grazing program by 1988. In Arizona this in-
volves 13 statements encompassing 12.5 million acres. This environmental analysis requirement
has put cultural resource inventory, evaluation, and sensitivity assessment on a radically ac-
celerated schedule, and has called for considerable innovation in the application of sampling
methods and analytical techniques. To date, three distinctive approaches have been taken in
Arizona; this symposium examines each from both compliance and professional contribution
points of view.
(49) INTERDISCIPLINARY STUDIES INOTOMANGUEAN. The development of a culture area may
be investigated from various perspectives. Archaeology provides insights into material culture,
socio-political organization, and regional relationships. Historical linguistics reveals regional
relationships; reconstructions of vocabulary reflect prehistoric culture. Ethnohistory and
ethnography furnish more direct evidence for later periods. When focused on common problems,
these disciplines form a powerful tool in the reconstruction of culture history. Otomanguean as a
culture area has until recently been neglected, although significant contributions exist in various
sub-areas. This symposium presents two overviews (linguistics and archaeology) and two
specific examples of interdisciplinary investigation, with discussion by specialists from ar-
chaeology, linguistics, and ethnohistory.

ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS*
Ackerly, Neal W. (Arizona) MODELING MICROWEAR FORMATION: A FEASIBILITY STUDY
BASED ON FRACTURE MECHANICS. Most experimental studies of microwear formation on
lithics are of limited utility because the results cannot be extrapolated to other lithic assem-
blages. This results from the fact that raw materials are selected according to geological “type”
classifications. Instead, the focus should be on lithological attributes that are critical in mi-
crowear formation. Regression analyses indicate that the mechanical properties of various
rocks may be reliably estimated on the basis of the apparent specific gravity, apparent porosity,
and hardness of specimens. The implications of this approach for developing models of mi-
crowear formation on the basis of fracture mechanics formulas are discussed. (25)
Ackerly, N. W. (see Sutro, L. S.) (38)
Ackerman, Robert E. (Washington State) ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE SOVIET FAR EAST: THE TAD-
USHA RIVER SITE. Research in 1976 at the Institute of History, Novosibirsk. USSR, focused on
Paleolithic sites in eastern Siberia and the Soviet Far East. Special studies were made of the
inventory of the Tadusha River site, Soviet Maritime District, excavated by A. P. Okladnikov in
1963 and 1968. The site has been seen as a link in the Spread of an Upper Paleolithic core and
blade industry from Asian shores to North America. The report will evaluate the site data,
specifically the undescribed 1968 inventory, and attempt to place the industry into a techno-
logical and temporal perspective. (44)
Adams, E. Charles (Museum of Northern Arizona) ROOM SIZE AND ITS RELATION TO ROOM
FUNCTION. Detailed maps and measured drawings of over 100 rooms in the historic Hopi village
of Walpi have provided a wealth of architectural data, One intriguing relationship observed
during this work was the apparent correlation between room size and room function. When
plotted statistically, it was found that this relationship did exist and that one can predict with
considerable accuracy the function or use of a room by simply measuring its size. Information
on use of the rooms was obtained from informants living In, orborn at Walpi. (38)
Adams, Karen R. (Eastern New Mexico) A NEW METHOD FOR QUANTITATIVELY EVALUATING
WILD PLANT RESOURCES IN THE RIO PUERCO VALLEY OF NEW MEXICO. Wild plants growing
in a site catchment receive scores based primarily upon ethnographic use. Scores for plants
that meet daily needs (food, fuel) are weighted the heaviest. Food plant scores reflect depend-
ability, seasonal availability, size of the plant part collected, and methods of collection and
preparation. A final tally is compounded from all parts of a plant used. A high total score
indicates a valuable resource. These plant scores are multiplied by the land area they once
occupied surrounding on site. Unique site catchment scores are generated that facilitate quan-
; titative comparison of site location, (47)
Adams, R. E. W, (Texas-San Antonio) RANK ORDERING, MAYA CENTERS, AND IMPLICATIONS.
The application of a rank ordering technique to the problem of hierarchical relationships among
Maya centers yields suggestive patterns. Numerical assessment is based on courtyard and
acropolis counts, and supplementally on a volumetric assessment technique developed by ESR
and NI Turner. Order of magnitude patterns allow implications as to hierarchical relationships,
relative population densities, and dynastic stability. (27)
Adovasio, J. M. (Pittsburgh) PERISHABLE INDUSTRIES FROM HINDS CAVE. The manufacture
of basketry and cordage at Hinds Cave is discussed in terms of process and product. The
evolution of these industries throughout the occupational sequence is detailed and compared
to developmental sequences elsewhere in Trans-Pecos Texas. Utilizing the Hinds Cave data on
these two classes of perishable artifacts in conjunction with data from other sites in the region,
a general developmental sequence for the two industries in question is generated for the entire
Trans-Pecos Texas cultural province. (28)
Ahlstrom, Richard V. N. (Arizona) DENDROCHRONOLOGY OF THE HOPI PUEBLO OF WALEPI:
A PRELIMINARY INTERPRETATION. Four hundred and seventy tree-ring dates obtained during
research associated with the restoration of Walpi permit several preliminary interpretations: (1)
strong support for the Hopi tradition that the present Walpi Pueblo was founded soon after the
“Abstracts listed alphabetically by senior author; please see program for full citation.

, .
Pueblo Revolt of 1680; (2) earlier beams come from a village founded by A.D. 1400; (3) lack of
dates between 1710 and 1880 results from sampling problems, lack of construction, or recent
dismantling of upper story structures; and (4) many old structures were dismantled and new
ones built between 1880 and 1940, reflecting changes in the use of Walpi and/or changes in
Hopi life style. (30)

Aikens, C. Melvin (see Mehringer, Peter J., Jr.) (5)
Aldenderfer, Mark S. (Missouri-St. Louis) EMPIRICALLY EVALUATING MULTIVARIATE STATIS-
TICAL METHODS: SITE TYPOLOGIES AND CLUSTER ANALYSIS. Although multivariate statis-
tical methods are frequently used in archaeological research, few attempts have been made to
evaluate the performance of these data sets with known structure. This type of evaluation is
especially necessary where little or no theoretical justification for the use of any multivariate
method exists, such as in archaeology. This paper presents a series of experiments designed
to evaluate how well certain cluster analysis methods reconstruct site typologies based on
functional attributes. Although the focus of the paper is restricted, it will be demonstrated that
the results obtained show striking convergence with evaluation studies from different scientific
disciplines on very different data sets, thus increasing the significance of the results, Pragmatic
suggestions on the use of cluster analysis will be offered for a variety of archaeological situ-
ations that are likely to obtain in many applications. (1 5)

Allen, Lawrence P. (SUNY-Buffalo) INTRA-URBAN EXCHANGE AT TEOTIHUACAN: EVIDENCE
FROM MOLD-MADE FIGURINES. Among the items collected in the course of the Teotihuacan
Mapping Project survey are a variety of mold-made figurines. This paper considers patterning
in the distributions of two related classes of these, manufactured late in the city’s history. Sets
of figurines produced from a single mold can be identified. Patterns produced from a series of
simulation models utilizing varying stipulations concerning the loci of figurine production, ex-
change, and utilization are compared with the characteristics of the actual arrangements of
sets discovered in an attempt to estimate paths travelled by the products of a common mold
to discard and ultimate collection. (21)

Ambler, J. Richard (Northern Arizona) THE SAN MATEO PROJECT SO FAR. Intensive survey in
the area of San Mateo, northwestern New Mexico, has shown evidence of several thousands of
years of occupation, with the most intensive utilization of the area occurring during the climatic
optimums around the 1100's and early 1700's. These periods have been the subject of intensive
excavations at a small Anasazi village and an early Navajo settlement. Architectural features,
artifact analysis, and ecological/subsistence data are summarized, with emphasis on the inten-
sive ceramic analysis and the data relating to subsistence patterns, and how the information
gained to date affects our planning for future work. (38)

Anderson, Arthur J.O. A NOTE ON SAHAGUN'S SPANISH TEXT. While usually the Spanish text
of Sahagin's General history glosses and summarizes rather than translates the Nahuatl, the
Spanish sometimes gives fuller information than the Nahuat! does. Such differences in the

: texts are of various kinds and may be variously explained. The texts are quite often comple-

mentary and are best so used. (16)

Anderson, Bruce (NPS) THE ANTIQUITIES ACT IN THE 10TH CIRCUIT COURT: FAILURE TO
PROSECUTE DUE TO VAGUENESS, A recent attempt to prosecute an alleged violation of the

Antiquities Act in the 10th Circuit Court failed in August, 1977, because of vagueness in the

Act in general, and because of the Diaz decision in specific. The decision extends the vagueness

interpretation into the 10th Circuit, whereas before it had affected only the 9th Circuit. The
details of the case are presented and legislative means of coping with these difficulties are
suggested. (12)

Anderson, Joseph K. (SIU-Carbondale) RESEARCH DEALING WITH ARCHAEOMAGNETIC DAT-

ING ON BLACK MESA. Two years of experiments with the use of archaeomagnetic dating

procedures on Black Mesa are discussed. Types of samples taken, the procedures involved and

the types of data extracted are dealt with. In addition, the use of this technique as both a dating

, PERSPECTIVE. This paper examines the Late Postclassic period in Mesoamerica in an evolu-
tionary and regional framework. It is proposed that the Late Postclassic represents an evolu-
tionary development partly determined by previous stages, but differing in the organization of
production and exchange, Supporting data are provided by a comparison of political and eco-
nomic organization in several regions, including the Valley of Oaxaca, (29)
Arundale, Wendy Hanford (Burke Museum) A PRELIMINARY SURVEY OF THE CAPE DORSET
AREA, BAFFIN ISLAND, N.W.T., CANADA. This paper outlines the goals of the survey, presents
some brief background on the area it covered, describes survey activities, and summarizes
survey findings. Although famous for the original Dorset culture collection described by Jen-
ness in 1925, the Cape Dorset area is poorly known archaeologically. This survey, conducted
during August 1977, showed that prehistoric occupation of the area was quite dense. Site
components ranging from PreDorset to modern were discovered. The survey prepared the way
for future research in the area by obtaining local permission and cooperation, by familiarizing
researchers with local conditions, and by confirming the area's suitability for paleoclimatic
research based on pollen analysis. (11)
Autry, William O., Jr. (Vanderbilt) THE ROLE OF DOCUMENTARY SOURCES IN ARCHAEOLOGY:
WHERE HAS ALL THE THEORY GONE? In recent years archaeologists have turned with greater
frequency to certain types of documentary accounts—most often to put “flesh on the bare
bones of prehistory.” Unfortunately, in many cases documents are employed in theoretically
weak positions in the research, frequently in post-fieldwork explanatory roles rather than in an
interactive research framework that permits feedback between the historical data and the ar-
chaeological fieldwork. Particular document classes are illustrated and critically evaluated for
various levels of archaeological research. A multistage research design incorporating docu-
ments into all levels of archaeological research is proposed and evaluated. (6)
Ayres, Harvard (Appalachian State) THE GEOLOGY OF CHERTS—A GEOARCHAEOLOGIST’S
VIEWS. Chert is defined as a cryptocrystalline to micro-crystalline rock, containing a very high
percentage of silica. It forms in several different geological environments including primary
depositional, secondary replacement, and hydrothermal. The environment of deposition may
well be a key to [he geochemistry. It seems likely that the elements found in cherts, other than
silica, which allow the geochemist to differentiate them are due to the quantity and kinds of
Clays present. (43)
Bacon, Marlys (Texas-Austin) LOANWORDS IN OAXACAN CERAMIC TERMINOLOGY. The dif-
ferentiation of the major language groups of the Otomanguean family occurred before the
| appearance of pottery in Mesoamerica. Potterymaking probably was not independently invented
in each group, and terminology may have diffused along with techniques. Comparative analysis
of contemporary pottery terminology from Oaxacan languages discloses loanwords for some
form categories. Identification of the source and direction of borrowing provides information
on the relative dominance of neighboring societies in the past. Previous linguistic studies in
subgrouping, phonological history, and glottochronology allow the postulation of approximate
time-depths and relative geographic locations of these linguistic borrowing-relations. (49)
Baerreis, David A. (Wisconsin-Madison) PALEOCLIMATIC IMPLICATIONS OF GASTROPODS AT
RODGERS SHELTER. Paleoclimatic interpretations based upon gastropod evidence have most
commonly been based upon species changes in gastropod assemblages. The extremely broad
| range of many species can result in an erroneous appearance of environmental Stability, as is
perhaps the case in current interpretations of the Meadowcroft site, since only the extreme
changes from glacial! to interglacial result in range shifts of sufficient magnitude to be reflected
in the stratigraphic record. Clinal variations in modern gastropod size are illustrated and used
in conjunction with size variations over time at Rodgers Shelter to derive temperature and
precipitation data for the archaeological sequence. (26)
Baird, Ellen Taylor (Nebraska-Lincoln) THE ARTISTS OF SAHAGUN'S PRIMEROS MEMORI-
ALES. It has commonly been assumed that the illustrations of the Primeros Memoriaies were
executed by Sahagin’s native informants; however, the inclusion of elements of European style
and form suggest that the artists were SahagUn's assistants, young native noblemen who had
been educated in a humanistic, European manner by Franciscan monks. Analysis of the ilius-
trations with respect to the styles of individual artists and the use of pre-Conquest or European
form and style potentially reveals the identity of the artists. (16)

the Middle Rio Puerco Valley of New Mexico. Subsequently, a non-typological ceramic approach
was developed incorporating attributes of vessel morphology, Various seriation techniques
were utilized to evaluate the chronologic sensitivity of attributes within stratigraphic proveni-
ences, Attributes that were initially defined as temporally sensitive were further investigated to
test their correlation and/or independence. Various multivariate techniques incorporating in-
dependent temporally sensitive attributes were employed to order known stratigraphic prov-

Ball, Joseph W. (San Diego State) POLYCHROME POTTERY AND REGIONAL EXCHANGE IN
THE EARLY CLASSIC NORTHERN MAYA LOWLANDS. Over the past half century, a repetition-
hallowed model of Lowland Maya polychrome pottery production and distribution has devel-
oped which posits a southern Lowland—primarily northcentral Peten—origin for such decorat-
ed wares in combination with a literally rapacious northern Maya market, This model is exam-
ined in light of recent stylistic and non-analytical physical studies of third through seventh
century A.D. polychrome decorated pottery from selected sites in the northern and southeastern
Lowlands and an alternative reconstruction is offered. (21)
Bandy, Philip A. (Texas Tech) THE TECHNOLOGICAL RECONSTRUCTION OF A NORTHERN
TEXAS LITHIC ASSEMBLAGE. The study of chipped stone tools has utilized various approaches
that include interpretation of function, morphological classification, and replication. This paper
reports a laboratory study that examined the manufacturing process responsible for the making
of a prehistoric Texas assemblage. It reconstructs the lithic manufacturing technology using
a combination of traditional descriptive analysis and chipping replication. A technological mod-
el or reconstruction was developed, then tested. This approach permits a refinement of inter-
pretation heretofore not possible and is applicable to other lithic studies. The study assemblage
represents the second of three distinct stages of manufacturing in the production of finished
and partially finished artifacts for large-scale trade of Alibates flint. (25)

Barrera Rubio, Alfredo (Yucatan) A STUDY OF SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE UXMAL AREA,
YUCATAN, MEXICO. The results of a preliminary settlement pattern study in the Uxmal area are
described. The study concentrated on the relationship of the civic-ceremonial center, which is
enclosed by a wall, and the surrounding residential zones and their related features. Variable
soil types and the absence of available water sources appear to be conditional factors in dis-
29
, tribution of settlement zones. A close association was observed between high status architec-
tural assemblages and chu/tunes or water reservoirs, suggesting that access to water storage
units was a prominent aspect of the socio-political organization of the ancient Puuc center, (27)
Bartel, Brad (San Diego State) ARCHAEOLOGICAL OPERATIONALISM OF COLONIALISM AND
IMPERIALISM: AN EXAMPLE FROM PROVINCIAL ROME, Archaeologists lack explicitly devel-
oped procedures for studying cultural processes of colonialism and imperialism. When dealing
with state societies in economic and political contact with other cultures of various degrees of
Organizational complexity, it becomes necessary to distinguish patterns of ethnic boundary
maintenance and the manner and extent of cross-cultural adhesion. The /imes frontier zone of
the Roman provinces of Pannonia and Upper Moesia present evidence, both archaeological and
ethnohistorical, supporting a revised methodology for the study of colonialism and imperialism.
Research conducted on urban and rural populations is presented, representing plural ethnic
situations under different mechanisms of social control. (23)

Arizona. it consists primarily of three large pueblo room blocks, extensive burial areas, and a
number of associated features. A preliminary investigation of the site was carried out in July,
1977, by Arizona State University. Analysis of the recovered artifacts, including the differential

also discussed. (38)
Bawden, Garth (Harvard) THE SOCIAL CONTEXT OF MOCHE V CERAMICS. Studies of Moche
pottery have been chiefly chronological and iconographic. A Moche V collection from the urban
site of Galindo enables the study of the ceramics in their total cultural setting. Comparison of
these data with early Moche and later Chimu ceramic Styles indicates the probable nature of
social development during these cultural periods. A trend toward increased social Stratification,
administrative centralization, and the rising importance of secular aspects of social integration
is Suggested by the Galindo pottery and its context. (9)
Bayham, Frank E. (Arizona State) A CONSIDERATION OF SPECIES ABUNDANCE AND SIZE ON
ANIMAL EXPLOITATION. Subtle intra-regional variability was observed between faunal assem-
| blages from archaeological sites within the Copper Basin region, west-central Arizona. By fo-
cusing on the attributes of species abundance and size in the prehistoric record, it was found
| that much of the variability could be expressed in terms of large to small mammal ratios.
Lacking modern comparative biomass data, the attempt was made to derive ecological impli-
cations for these differences from models of optimal diet. These implications are evaluated for
their potential to explain and predict. (47)

Berry, Claudia (Museum of Northern Arizona) LITHIC ANALYSIS OF ASSEMBLAGES FROM
NORTHEASTERN ARIZONA. This paper represents a progress report on the analysis of lithic
material from preceramic and ceramic sites in northeastern Arizona. The large number of
aceramic sites located along the Coronado Transmission Line has afforded an excellent Op-
portunity for analyzing lithic assemblages in an area where little more than basic reporting has
been done. In addition, selected artifacts from the Museum of Northern Arizona collections,
representing Over 100 other sites in the area, are being analyzed in order to set up a basic
taxonomic system and more accurately define and describe the assemblages and technological
entities that characterize the area. (42)

Bettinger, Robert L. (New York) ABORIGINAL FOOD PRODUCTION IN OWENS VALLEY, EAST-

in this locality, however, remain unclear with respect to: (1) the antiquity of irrigation; (2) causal
, explanations for its inception; (3) the role of food production in the subsistence economy; and,

(4) the impact of irrigation on socio-political organization. Historic documents, ethnographic

extensive data bank, suitable for several Jevels of interpretation. The modeling of short range,

Blifeld, Susan (UCLA) ATTRIBUTAL ANALYSIS OF SOLVIEUX BURINS. Chisel-ended tools
termed burins often constitute the single most important lithic class in Upper Paleolithic artifact
assemblages. The burin assemblages from the open-air site of Solvieux comprise some of the
most interesting samples of these tools excavated in recent years in southwest France. The
Solvieux burins provide an excellent body of data with which to test conventional approaches
to artifact classification as well as to assess new methodologies of typological analysis. This
paper summarizes a pilot study of the Solvieux Magdalenian | burin assemblage conducted
with a quantitative attributal approach designed to monitor formal variability peculiar to burin
populations. The results of this study and its potential significance to method and theory of
lithic artifact typology are discussed. (34)

completed. Twenty-seven units were excavated, with 12 units being placed in the midden. Ma-
terial goods and archaeological features were scarce, but valuable data concerning Archaic

cerned determining the extent and variability of artifactual deposits on a heavily forested ridge
in coastal South Carolina (Huger Site, 38BK211). To gain a representative sample and minimize
costs, we developed a subsurface testing procedure using a stratified unaligned sampling strat-
egy. The ridge was divided into 4 microtopographic areas and 100 test pits proportioned ac-
cording to the percent area of each of these areas. A series of maps was generated from the
excavated material to form the basis for subsequent excavation design. The paper discusses
and evaluates the practical and methodological aspects of the sampling strategy. (13)

in the Greater Southwest of skulls with tabular oblique deformation may provide evidence of
individuals traveling and trading from Nuclear Mesoamerica. The implications of these finds
may relate to the movements of pochtecas into the northwestern frontier along a trading corridor
of the Sierra Madre Occidental. The inference is that skulls with tabular oblique cranial defor-
mation are evidence of individual pochteca in an area outside of Nuclear Mesoamerica. (37)

Browman, David L. (Washington-St. Louis) THE INTEGRATION OF ANDEAN TIWANAKU WITH
iTS HINTERLANDS. The second period of Andean empires is characterized by two competing
states—Wari (A.D. 500-800) and Tiwanaku (A.D. 400-1000). The different general patterns of
organization that we can reconstruct, with the Wari mainly dependent upon military coercion
as contrasted to the apparently more egalitarian economic interdependence of the Tiwanaku
federation, helps to explain both their differing rates of expansion and their life-span. With the
collapse of Wari, we can document a shift in the altiplano-based Tiwanaku organization, with
expansion into the Pacific coastal areas previously on the Wari frontier, and simultaneous new
interactions with the Amazonian yungas corn-producing areas. (23)

Brown, Galen N. (NPS) ECOLOGICAL MAPPING FOR PURPOSES OF SAMPLE STRATIFICATION
IN LARGE-SCALE CULTURAL RESOURCES ASSESSMENT. Both Federal policy and archaeo-
logical practice have often called for “inventory survey” as a viable first stage in cultural re-
sources management efforts. As assessment and conservation efforts increase in number and
especially in size, however, it becomes apparent that finding each site is impossible. Nonethe
less, some idea of the nature and distribution of sites is necessary for the planning of subse
quent mitigation, conservation, and research, This problem can be solved through the appli-
cation of a multi-stage sampling design based on environmental stratification. Remote sensing
methods, which provide an efficient means of such regional stratification, will be discussed.

Bussey, Stanley D. (New Mexico State) THE SMALL CONTRACT AS RESEARCH, In contract
archaeology the small project—such as a single drilling location or a few hundred feet of
pipeline—has generally been regarded as having no research potential because of the limited
scope and low budgets of such projects. In fact, .if proper planning and attitudes exist, the small

33
, project can be a valuable, if limited, part of a regional research design. The factors that affect
the research potential of the small project are attitude, planning, and the ethics of contract
archaeology. (39)

Search-oriented archaeology. As a consequence, the small survey report is a poor source of
data, and its utility as a research document is nonexistent. This problem can be overcome if
the small-scale survey would address itself to questions related to subsistence and settlement
behavior. A report format formulated both to provide the necessary data required by this general
framework, and designed to yield information needed by those involved in planning and man-

Byrd, Kathleen M. (LSU) ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA RELATIVE TO PREHISTORIC SUBSISTENCE
IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI ALLUVIAL VALLEY. Man has inhabited the Lower Mississippi
Valley for at least 12,000 years. During that time he has relied upon many different foods, both
wild and domesticated. The types of these foods and their importance has changed through
time. Wild plant foods were always important, but the reliance on the tropical cultigens—
squash, corn, and beans—increased during the late prehistoric times. Native domesticated
plants, for example the sunflower, were also cultivated. Animals played an important role in
prehistoric subsistence, especially the larger, common species. The Paleo-indians used the
Spear to kill their game. The Meso-Indians relied on the atlati, in addition to the spear. And the
Neo-Indians adopted the bow and arrow as well. (46)

expected that the higher density associated with fall resource exploitation is the result of the
combined exploitative activities of groups adapted only to the uplands and groups adapted to
both the lowlands and uplands. The pattern of sustained year-round habitation of “hill people”
has implications for the study of cultural isolates and cultural conservatism. (35)

Cantwell, Anne-Marie E. (Rutgers-Newark) HOPEWELL REDUX: PATTERNS OF CHERT USE
DURING THE HAVANA TRADITION. Current explanations of the Hopewell Interaction Sphere
stress the exchange of rituals, as well as sociotechnic and ideotechnic artifacts and their raw
materials, among the participating traditions. However, an analysis of two early Havana Tra-
dition sites in the central illinois Valley shows that exotic cherts were imported for the manu-
facture of technomic artifacts, such as lamellar flake blades, because these cherts possessed
the requisite structural qualities lacking in the abundant, coarse-grained, fossiliferous, local
cherts. Models for Hopewellian trade should, therefore, be expanded to include the exchange
of subsisténce related goods. Shifts in chert use in late Havana times are discussed and related
to the collapse of the Hopewell Interaction Sphere. (35)

the National Science Foundation and about 6 times that provided by the National Geographic

34
, Society. Nevertheless, this program accounts for only about .00055% of the federal budget.
Analysis of the funding pattern indicates that since 1963 there has been a general decrease in
the amount of deflated funding available through the National Park Service, and that since 1973
the decrease has been precipitous. Implications of this funding pattern are discussed. (12)

studies have used site assemblages and site locations as indicators of the kind and amount of
activities conducted at sites. Both of these indicators are explicitly used in testing how limited
activity sites functioned in prehistoric subsistence systems in the highlands of Black Mesa.

his food niche. Such changes are the result of decisions about food procurement and con-

Clark, G. A. (Arizona State) THE LA RIERA PALEOECOLOGICAL PROJECT (ASTURIAS, SPAIN):
AIMS AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS. Excavations at the stratified cave site of La Riera are
central to an understanding of intraregional variability in human adaptation to the Cantabrian
zone during the late Pleistocene/early Holocene (20,000-8,900 B.P.). Preliminary results docu-
ment: (1) the presence of dense “living floors” with associated features, (2) patterns of lithic
and bone artifact variability that cross-cut traditional culture-stratigraphic units, (3) marked
variation in the incidence of faunal debris categories (body parts), suggesting differential treat-
ment of different species and variation through time linked to shifts in site function, (4) a long-
term increase in the exploitation of shell-fish, and (5) evidence for major late/Post-Pleistocene
climatic changes. (34)

Cohen, Mark N. (SUNY-Plattsburgh) CARRYING CAPACITY, PERIODIC RESOURCE FAILURE,
AND THE REGULATION OF PLEISTOCENE POPULATIONS: A CRITIQUE OF SOME RECENT
MODELS. Ethnographic data suggest that the impact of environmental fluctuations on human
populations is governed by socio-political variables affecting a group's ability to adjust to
environmental change. Archaeological data suggest that early Pleistocene societies were well
buffered against periodic shortages, Famine is probably a recent phenomenon among hunter-
gatherers. The importance of crises in calculating carrying capacity and their importance as
population limiting devices in the Pleistocene have both been overplayed in the recent literature.
The deterioration of socio-political homeostatic devices in the late Pleistocene may explain the
emergence of trade in luxury goods as a means of regenerating homeostatic social networks.

Cone, Gerald (Wisconsin-Milwaukee) COMPUTER AIDED ANALYSIS OF CERAMICS FROM THE
PUEBLA PRECLASSIC PROJECT. In recent years the Puebla Preclassic Project has recovered
well over 100,000 ceramic artifacts from intensive site survey and from test excavations of five
sites. We suggest that the span represented by these ceramic artifacts covers the Middle Pre-
classic period to the Late Classic period. It was decided before fieldwork was begun that only
a cursory subjective typology would be attempted in the field, and that a computer aided anal-
ysis would be done at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. All sherds were coded for com-
puter aided analysis. The analysis is now in progress and some methods and results will be
discussed. (40)

Cooke, Richard G. (Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute) THE WHITE-TAILED DEER IN PRE-
HISTORIC PANAMA: AN HYPOTHESIS FOR THE MANIPULATION OF WILD POPULATIONS IN

35
, THE NEOTROPICS. Following the demise of the Pleistocene megafauna, the largest palatable
terrestial mammals that were available to the prehistoric inhabitants of Central America were
the tapir, the white-lipped peccary, and the white-tailed deer. While the tapir and peccary require
heavily forested habitats and rapidly move off in the face of human pressure, the last named is
well-known to thrive in disturbed, man-made habitats and to be able to resist heavy and constant
hunting pressure. In Central Panama (Coclé), where the population of hunter-gatherers and,
later, sedentary agriculturalists increased rapidly from about 5000 B.C. to 1500 A.D., evidence
from archaeological middens and ethnohistoric sources indicates that the white-tailed deer was
exploited intensively and in similar proportions throughout this period, without a significant
decline. An hypothesis is presented for the artificial manipulation of the white-tailed deer in
this area, and some theories regarding the lack of domestication in the Neotropics are consid-
ered in light of this evidence, (32)
Coombs, Gary (California-Santa Barbara) DECISION THEORY AND SUBSISTENCE STRATE-

for understanding the specific subsistence strategies adopted by various human populations.
Much of this debate revolves around two related questions: (1) whether is is acceptable to treat
the environment as a rational adversary, and (2) whether it is useful to approach problems
involving population behavior from the level of the rational individual. This paper attempts to
demonstrate that regardless of the answers to these questions, Decision Theory provides a
number of valuable insights to the study of human subsistence behavior. (36)

of complex societies, but to date no researcher has been able to demonstrate this empirically.
This paper discusses this problem and also a method—the use of LANDSAT data—which can
produce highly accurate calculations of agricultural productivity that can then be compared
with available information about the change through time in population densities in the Valley
of Oaxaca. (29)

VALLEY, PERU. This paper examines the Incaic militaristic expansion and incorporation of the
Upper Mantaro region in the Central Highlands of Peru. During the Late Intermediate Period,
just prior to incorporation, the Mantaro region was characterized by hierarchal social organi-
zation and intergroup warfare. Data derived from the preliminary stage of a regional research
project, using intensive surface collection, site mapping, and limited excavations, address the
ena (1) how the local stratified society was incorporated into the interregional
organization of the Incaic state; and (2) what the effects were on local social and economic
organization of an imposed peace. (23)

WITHIN A CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK. The Arizona State Museum
has investigated 183 km of transmission line corridor and ancillary facilities such as power
generating substations and access roads for a southeastern Arizona utility. Multi-stage research
conducted within a cultural resource management framework identified 116 archaeological
sites; 35 of these were subjected to intensive data recovery. As sponsor planning, design, and
construction phases for the various facilities overlapped, the Museum was able to integrate
research formulation, resource identification, mitigation recommendation, and systematic data
recovery and analysis stages into the contractor's schedule. Flexibility on the part of both
institutions facilitated engineering and research revisions, Project management and research

of Maya impact on the lacustrine ecosystem of Lakes Yaxha and Sacnab. Settlement, and
perturbing population and agroengineering forces, determined archaeologically, were nearly
two times greater in the Yaxha sub-basin. Preliminary evidence suggests that Phosphorus flux,
measured as net output to sediments, was sharply accelerated by human exploitation, more
sharply in the Yaxha sub-basin. As Phosphorus is neither recycled atmospherically nor exported
from the basins, deductions from fully parametrized models of Phosphorus flux can be used to
clarify feedback terms in more complex models of other nutrients. (10)
Dekin, Albert A. (SUNY-Binghamton) SPATIAL THEORY AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SITE
EXAMINATION IN THE NORTHEAST. For the last year, we have worked to provide an empirical
base for maximizing inferences from minimal data on site character and content. We have
evaluated several categories of test data to several areal scales in order to determine and to
test mathematical models that interrelate them. While these approaches have resulted in cost-
effective refinements in our research strategies, they have raised several questions of spatial
theory and of the assumptions that underlie traditional approaches to site examination and
evaluation. This paper briefly examines several of these problems as necessary theoretical
background to further discussions of research methodology. (13)

the region are interpreted as indicating general continuity in adaptive patterning throughout
| middie-to-late prehistoric times, Recently, however, an extensive site in the lower Pecos valley
has been briefly investigated and is hypothesized to reflect a late prehistoric occupation in the

resulted in the collection of chipped stone artifacts from thirty-five sites. Formal attributes of
artifacts were recorded and subjected to computerized statistical analyses in an attempt to
achieve the foliowing goals: (1) thorough description of lithics, (2) identification of technological
and/or cultural traditions, and (3) identification of variability in aboriginal land use. Microwear

of the presumed Tikat-sustaining area is made using data on corn yields, fallow cycles, acreage
requirements, and per capita corn consumption collected among modern Maya mi/peros in the
Peten. A large discrepancy is found to exist between the magnitude of the population estimated
for the site and the number of people who could have been supported in its sustaining area if
milpa agriculture had been the main prehistoric subsistence strategy practiced there. Alterna-
tive or supplemental food-energy sources are noted. (27)

field investigations. First, data on soil permeability and surface slope, in combination, have
proven to be a sound basis for stratifying terrain into units that can be ranked for probability
of site encounter. At a larger scale, stream basins ranked by the Strahler method display positive
(but not simple) correlations with observed site frequencies per stream unit length. These pre-
dictive methods promise greatly increased efficiency in the planning of survey activities in the
selection of search methods appropriate to different kinds of terrain. (13)

Di Peso has proposed that the Upper Pima and Papago of Pimeria Alta were part of an older
Ootam cultural continuum going back to a common indigenous Cochise Culture origin. This
concept involves a culture conquest model with groups of indigenous Chichimecan folk, at
various times in their history, put upon by alien or donor cultures such as the Hohokam. This
disposition permits archaeologists to separate physical traits and attributes of indigenous
groups from those of alien groups in order to trace artifact designs in terms of such control

of the survey area is compared with regional patterns of site settlement and type, with particular
attention given to the historic village and “refuge period” sites. (45)

forward with fewer of the technical and logistic tools than desired in meeting sample inventory
needs, needs imposed for purposes other than “research.” A principal challenge is to satisfy
both professional and management obligations simultaneously, in the absence of agreed-upon

simple tribal structures in the pre-Classic period to chiefdom or state structures during the

in the social organization of the two periods, but that they do not necessarily reflect traditional

though we were able to reproduce the high level of collection accuracy (i.e., alpha 95s 3°),
dating was still ambiguous. Often good samples did not plot near the curve, and in others the
position did not agree well with archaeological context information about expected dates. Solv-

Elston, Robert (Nevada-Reno) MEDITHERMAL CLIMATIC VARIATION AND CULTURE CHANGE
ON THE EASTERN SIERRA FRONT. Recent studies provide support for the hypothesis that the
Martis and Kings Beach complexes represent different adaptations to climatic variation. Neo-
glacial conditions in Martis times (4,000-2,000 8.P.) resulted in a relatively high regional carrying
capacity that allowed social organization at the band level, craft specialization, nucleated winter
village sites, regular use of favored base camp sites, and a territorially oriented subsistence
strategy. Since about 2,000 B.P. the regional carrying capacity has been relatively low, requiring
means of adaptation such as recorded for the Washo: a non-territorial, dispersed subsistence
strategy, a nonnucleated settlement pattern, and a level of social organization between the
family and the composite band. (5)

whose vertices correspond to the settlements themselves, or to variables under study. Com-

test the hypotheses concerned with spatial and temporal variability within the ceramic data set.
A diachronic relationship between administrative organization and ceramic production is shown
to exist and several interpretive implications of this relationship outside the Valley of Oaxaca
are suggested. (29)

LUSKS TO MEASURE ECOLOGICAL CHANGE, Changes in agricultural practices may be deter-
mined from percentages of different molluscan remains found in archaeological phases. in
Belize, a uniquely long sequence allows one to trace these changes from the Early Preclassic
into the Postclassic, a sequence more than 3,000 years long. Comments are made on swidden-
ing, tree crops, intensive land utilization and the Corozal sample is compared with data from
the Peten and elsewhere in the Mayan area. (10)
Ferguson, T. J. (Zuni Archaeological Enterprise) THE GROWTH OF ZUNI PUEBLO. The growth
of Zuni Pueblo is discussed in terms of architecture, village layout, and the formation processes
of the archaeological record. A short architectural history of the pueblo is presented. Formation

Fesperman, Pamela R. (Florida State) NON-HUMAN BONE ALTERATION AND SCATTER PAT-
TERNS. During criminal investigations it is often necessary to determine whether the position
of human skeletal! remains is the result of a criminal act or natural cause. Moreover, bone
damage, when observed, also needs to be determined as being naturally or criminally inflicted.
Experimentation to clarify these problems was conducted using domestic and wild animals
- familiar to the northwest Florida area. The results of this study indicate that different animal
species alter bones and scatter them in unique ways. (31)

Local and regional aspects of prehistoric obsidian procurement are analyzed using Animas
phase data from southwestern New Mexico. The initial results of this study suggest that a dual
system involving both direct and indirect procurement was in use throughout the area. The
implications of such a dual system for the understanding of lithic raw materials use throughout
southwestern New Mexico are discussed. (33) |
Finsten, Laura (Calgary) THE CLASSIC-POSTCLASSIC TRANSITION IN THE VALLEY OF OAX-
ACA, MEXICO. Settlement pattern shifts following the abandonment of the Main Plaza at Monte
Alban suggest that the highly centralized primate system of the Late Classic collapsed and was
replaced by a more decentralized mode of regional organization. The nature of this Early Post-
classic settlement system is elucidated by the analysis of the distribution and internal orga-
nization of the major centers. (29)
Fisch, Eva(CUNY) DISCONTINUOUS SITE SIZE HIERARCHIES IN FORMATIVE MESOAMERICA.
Discontinuous site size hierarchies are the rule in most known Formative Mesoamerican
societies. One site can represent as much as three-fourths of the population of any one region.
This paper presents a model derived from locational theory to account for the existence of
discontinuous, two level settlement hierarchies with impressively large sites in the Early and
Middle Formative. The model is evaluated with data from the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico. (29)

, Fish, Paul (Georgia) BEYOND TOOLS: DEBITAGE ANALYSIS AND CULTURAL INFERENCE IN
THE MIDDLE PALEOLITHIC. Debitage has received cursory treatment in most Paleolithic arti-
fact analyses and interpretations related to debitage usually have been restricted to the nar-
rowest technological levels. In order to document the potential of debitage analysis for various
types of cultural inference, data from several Middle Paleolithic sites (Qafzeh, Tabun, Combe
Grenal, Pech de |'Aze, and Corbiac) are cited. For example, selective processes in tool use and
manufacture in single sites are inferred from the kinds and distributions of debitage. Debitage
is also utilized to provide insight into a range of questions of archaeological interest such as
activity location and chronology. (34)

the light of major differences found between collections in England and in Mediterranean Spain.
Only the Mousterian of Acheulean Tradition and Quina facies are represented in England, where-
as only Denticulate and sidescraper-enriched Typical facies have been found in eastern and

Ford, Richard |. (Michigan) THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL PLANT REMAINS FOR
INTERPRETING PREHISTORIC ADAPTATIONS ON BLACK MESA. More than 6,000 flotation
samples from archaeological sites on Black Mesa have been analyzed, The results support the
basic proposition that corn agriculture and the resulting plant community transformations as-
sociated with its technology increased the useful plant biomass of the prehistoric inhabitants.
Concomitantly, an increased population and reduction in alternative resources resulted in a
fragile ecosystem that was progressively degraded. Plant evidence includes charcoal, cultigens,
and seeds from a variety of indigenous plants. (22)

covered:through this research will be described and analyzed in this report in terms of the
following areas: (1) the type and range of variation of the raw material from which the artifacts
were manufactured, (2) the tool types that these specimens represent, (3) the identification of
the source of raw materials, and (4) the kind of technology that each represents. (40)
Francis, Julie E. (Arizona State) THE EFFECT OF CASUAL COLLECTION OF BEHAVIORAL
INTERPRETATIONS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA. The amount and quality of information that
can be gained through the systematic collection of surface remains is of great concern to
archaeologists undertaking regional surface surveys. Under ideal conditions, the kinds and
; dispersal of materials found on the surface of the site will reflect not only the behavior of the
prehistoric occupants, but the site's erosional and depositional history, as well as human action
subsequent to the original deposition of the site such as casual removal of materials from site
surfaces. This paper presents a method for the evaluation of casual surface collection from site
surfaces of 23 sites recorded during the 1976 survey of the Little Colorado Planning Unit. (6)
Freeman, L. G. (Chicago) THE GARBAGE SHALL RISE AGAIN: STONES, BONES, CHARCOAL
AND SEEDS FROM MOUSTERIAN LEVELS AT ABRIC AGUT (BARCELONA, SPAIN). During 1976,
excavations at the small shelter called Abric Agut near Capellades, undertaken as part of a
regional research project jointly directed by Freeman, E. Ripoll, and H. de Lumley, revealed
several intact levels containing Mousterian artifact assemblages, all apparently assignable to
a regional variant of the Denticulate facies. By means of simple water flotation, charcoal from
several deciduous and coniferous tree species was recovered from these levels, One occupation
yielded carbonized seeds, which we believe are food remains, This is, as far as we know, the
first time vegetal food remains have been recovered by flotation from Mousterian deposits in
Europe. (34)

terest in the prehistory of the extremely rugged, effectively inaccessible canyon bordering Idaho
and Oregon. Through legislation, there is financial support available or forthcoming for con-
ducting significant research in the prehistory of Hells Canyon. Limited previous research in
Hells Canyon has emphasized cultural relationships with the Plateau, belying significant Great

A MESOAMERICAN-DERIVED RECONSTRUCTION. Models for social ranking, i.e., chiefdom-like
Organization, have been presented in print by several individuals to account for what has been
aptly termed “the Chacoan phenomenon"; however, the models do not take account of Me-
soamerican derived features that are readily apparent in the area. The present paper utilizes
both internal and external causative factors with the latter acting as catalyst on the former. The
sequencing and patterning of cultural events offered by this interpretation appear to be con-
gruent with the archaeological data currently available. (37)
Fry, Robert E. (Purdue) MODELS OF EXCHANGE FOR FUNCTIONAL CLASSES OF LOWLAND
MAYA POTTERY. Several recent studies have shown that there are distinct distribution patterns
for major functional classes of pottery during the Classic period. This paper will propose aiter-
native models for pottery distribution at Lowland Maya sites, relating these to the overall eco-
nomic structure of lowland sites. Evidence in support of one of the models from research at
Tikal, Guatemala, and central Quintana Roo, Mexico will be presented. Implications of an ap-
proach to ceramic variability using both stylistic and technological attributes for traditional
Type Variety classification will be examined. (21)
Fryman, Jeanne W. (Museum of Northern Arizona) ANALYSIS OF THE INVENTORY DATA FOR
THE BLACK-CERBAT ENVIRONMENTAL STATEMENT AREA, NORTHWESTERN ARIZONA. The
Museum of Northern Arizona, as contractor, analyzed BLM's Black-Cerbat survey data and pre-
pared the cultural resource portions of the ES. Computer-aided analyses of the data were used
to generate management information relevant to identifying areas of critical concern for cultural
resources, evaluating probable impacts from the proposed action, and defining appropriate
mitigation measures. This paper makes a critical appraisal of the survey's adequacy for esti-
. mating cultural resource populations for both general and specific management purposes, and
examines the contributions of the survey and the data analysis to overall archaeological knowl-
edge of the project area. (48)

of their impact on cultural resources. Scarification is commonly employed by timber managers
to insure healthy timber regrowth on harvested units. The effect of this management practice

Garrow, Patrick H. (Soil Systems, Inc.) THE NEW AND THE OLD: THE BEDFORD-PINE AND
EDENTON ARCHAEOLOGICAL |NVESTIGATIONS. This paper discusses the approach to and '
results achieved from archaeological investigations of two urban tracts. Each tract occupied
the same relative geographical position within its respective city, and each city has grown
largely as a result of its strategic location within a regional transportation/communication net-
work, The methodology utilized to explore these tracts and the major results are discussed.
Problems faced during these investigations are also discussed, and an approach is delineated
that should be applicable to many types of urban archaeological investigations. (7)

Gasser, Robert E. (Arizona State) EXCHANGE IN HOHOKAM SUBSISTENCE PRACTICES. Did
the Hohokam engage in exchange of subsistence items? A comprehensive survey of intersite
variability in archaeobotanical food remains from Hohokam sites is examined with relation to
variability in the distribution of natural resources. Differences that cannot be explained using
strictly ecological parameters might indicate trade in subsistence items. Exchange models
developed from Pima and Papago ethnographies act as an aid in explaining the Hohokam
archaeobotanical data. (1)

Gero, Joan M. (Massachusetts-Amherst) DATA RETRIEVAL FROM STORED MEMORIES. Collec-
tor interviews can maximize the identification and location of sites when used to structure
fieldwork in intensively developed or heavily vegetated areas. In New England, the distribution
of collections and collector territories is a response to historic land tenure patterns and the
attendant concepts of property and ownership. The composition of collections today similarly
reflects local processes of trade and redistribution. From an understanding of these biases in
collector-provided data, the proposed strategies are recognized as providing predictable and
cost-efficient information. (13)

Gorman, Frederick J. E. (Boston) REFUSE PATTERNING IN AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY GLASS
MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY: IMPLICATIONS FOR URBAN HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY.
Most colonial pyrotechnic industries were situated near fuel forests until the late 18th century
when transportation improvements permitted their relocation in certain eastern cities. Estab-
lishment of urban glasshouses or metal foundries often initiated growth of heavy manufacturing
districts, and archaeological surveys of such regions should locate the remains of these fac-
tories. Our knowledge of metropolitan glasshouses and foundries rests more upon historical
than upon archaeological information. Since this bias is reversed in the study of their earlier
rural counterparts, analysis of refuse patterning at the rustic New England Glassworks (1780-
82) may aid in the archaeological identification of later urban factories. (7)
Gould, Robin A. (SiIU-Carbondale) CERAMIC IMITATION: A SUPPLY-DEMAND INTERPRETA-
TION. “imitation” ceramics or local varieties as an indigenous response to trade wares have
long been recognized in the archaeological record. The process underlying their inculcation
into the society in terms of response, assimilation of new ideas, and attempts to copy or imitate
has not been addressed by traditional archaeological typologies. Documented examples of
imitation will be summarized, and a formal economic solution will be offered to explain ceramic
distribution in terms of a supply and demand model. (38)
Grady, Mark A. (SMU) CONSIDERATIONS OF THE TEXAS ARCHAIC INTERACTION SPHERE.
Although the information that has been collected for the Archaic adaptation to Central and
East Texas is not consistent, it suggests that, from a broad regional perspective, this lifeway
changed considerably in terms of economic exchange networks and interaction spheres. More
specifically, shifts in lithic raw material usage, artifact manufacture, and assemblage integra-
tion suggest that the Archaic adaptation was characterized by a substantial reduction in eco-
nomic interaction and a concurrent trend toward localized specialization. Some of the impili-
cations of these observations are pursued, and suggestions are made for evaluating the ac-
curacy of the resultant premises. (35)
Graham, Martha (North Carolina-Chape!l Hill) SKELETAL RECOVERY IN FORENSIC CASES.
Proper recovery of skeletal material in forensic cases is crucial. Intervention by lay persons may
lead to destruction of the scene, less than full recovery of pertinent materials associated with

the above, and discussion follows as to education and working with law enforcement agents
in skeletal recovery procedures. (31)

Grayson, Donald K. (Washington) THE GATECLIFF SHELTER MICROVERTEBRATES. Gateciiff
Shelter (26NY301) is located in the Toquima Mountains of central Nevada. The rich and deep
deposits of the site span at least the last 8,000 years. The site yielded a very large vertebrate
fauna, the bulk of which is composed of artiodactyls, especially mountain sheep (Ovis cana-
densis). The sizeable sample of smaller vertebrates—insectivores, lagomorphs, rodents, and :
small carnivores—which is also present, forms the focus of this report. inferences concerning
the changing environments of the area surrounding Gatecliff Shelter which may be drawn from
the microvertebrates are discussed, as are the implications of this microfauna for understanding
the modern and past biogeography of Great Basin mammals. (5)

AND RESEARCH DESIGN. The cultural materialist paradigm sets clearly defined epistemolog-
ical limits for archaeological research. In these terms, existing models of the Desert-River Ho-
hokam interface are inadequate. Either they (1) are based on non-materialist assumptions and
propositions, or (2) are not systematically ordered in terms of the materialist paradigm. Fur-
thermore, a critical review of published and unpublished data from the Santa Cruz drainage
shows that these sources do not lend themselves to the systematic distributional studies from
which a materialist model might be constructed. In order to resolve this dilemma a multistage
research design to discover key patterns in material culture distributions is outlined. (8)

BLACK MESA. Results of a survey to locate sources of raw materials used in making chipped
stone artifacts for the Black Mesa area of northeastern Arizona are presented. The distribution
of the various raw material types for several hundred sites within a 50 square mile survey area
is discussed. Variation in the degree of reliance on different sources as indicated by proportions
of raw material on sites is viewed over time. Particular emphasis is placed on distance from
source and possible differences between habitation sites and limited activity sites. Computer
graphics are used to illustrate observed patterns. (22)
Green, Stanton W. (South Carolina) THE STABILITY OF FRONTIER AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS:
SOME ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE SPREAD OF AGRICULTURE IN TEMPER:
ATE HABITATS. Frontier agriculture is presented as a colonization process whereby agriculture
is introduced into a habitat. The discussion will focus on both the new set of culture-ecological
’ interactions set off by the colonization process and the implications for long term stability of
temperate agricultural systems. The model delineates key cultural and ecological variables and
suggests that, in temperate habitats, agricultural colonization tends to select for growing pop-
ulations, which self-perpetuate the colonization process, The archaeological implications of
this model for the spread of agriculture into temperate habitats are then discussed and evalu-
ated against two cases: prehistoric (neolithic) Denmark, and historic (16th century) Finland. (2)

PUBLIC ARCHAEOLOGY, Environmental laws in California require developers and land modi-

the letter and not the spirit of the law. This attitude has resulted in the need to educate land
developers about what archaeological resource evaluation entails and how archaeology can be
mutually beneficial to them and to archaeology. Using the HUD-sponsored San Buenaventura ‘

Gumerman, George J. (Southern \|ilinois) THE HOHOKAM OF THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY.
New data from the region north of Phoenix reinforces the suggestion that the Hohokam main-
tained an elaborate system of local specialization and trade in subsistence and non-subsistence
items. It appears that this internal Hohokam system of local specialization was reinforced by
46
, external economic relationships with the regions north and west of central Arizona. The result
of the local economic specialization and of locality specific exchange relationships with non-
Hohokam peoples has resulted in a large number of Hohokam “regional variations” in a rela-
tively small area in central Arizona. (8)

Hamblin, Robert L. (Arizona) ELITE DEVELOPMENT AND PEASANT REBELLION: MODELING
CLASSIC MAYA DATA. This paper employs mathematical models of social conflict, collective
learning, and social development to study the sociocultural growth and decline of the Classic
Maya. The data are the through-time occupancy of Maya ceremonial centers by peoples pro-
ducing elite monuments with long-count dates. A comprehensive theory is presented which
posits that the patterns of change resulted from the cumulative, through-time dialectic effects
of developing social technology and escalating conflict, eventuating in peasant rebellions. The
archaeological evidence for various alternative theories is then evaluated. This analysis shows
that the dialectic models can account for both the eras of growth and decline. (27)
Hammatt, Hallett H. (Archaeological Research Center Hawail) GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL STRA-
TIGRAPHY IN THE HAWAIIAN ISLANDS: SOME PROPOSITIONS AND PRELIMINARY RESULTS.
The relatively short time span of human occupation (approximately 1,300 years), extreme mi-
croenvironmental contrasts, and rapid pedogenic alteration of deposits would appear to limit
the application of inter-site stratigraphic research related to archaeological problems in the
Hawaiian Islands. However, investigations on the islands of Kaho’olawe and Kauai show that
there are recognizable local and regional stratigraphic sequences. On Kaho'olawe two major
depositional units are separated by one soil stratigraphic unit and a widespread charcoal layer.
There is evidence that island-wide burning may have been the initial cause of cumulative de-
nudation which dramatically altered habitats and led to depopulation of the island. (14)
Hampson, Steven E. (Irvine) CLOSED MODELS OF OPEN SYSTEMS. Cultural systems are open
systems: they lack clear divisions from one another, from noncultural systems, and from their .
own later phases. An indefinite number of variables interact in open systems; however, all
explicit systems models are closed since they must specify a definite number of variables. Two
consequences of this observation will be motivated and explored: (1) closed models of open
systems are most adequate when focused on system boundaries; (2) the possible descriptions
and strategies for explanation of cultural stability differ from those for cultural change. (2)

cations known to contain them. This paper discusses the results of the project and offers
47

patterns as they affect the archaeological record, (2) modern land use as it affects survey design,
(3) erosion as it pertains to site preservation, and (4) vegetation as a barrier to ground level
inspection. The emphasis is upon the relative effectiveness of sampling designs with respect
to archaeological distributions and the careful use of judgment. (13)

Harrold, Francis B., Jr. (Chicago) A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF EURASIAN PALEOLITHIC BUR-
IALS. Although they are a rich source of information on the sociocultural aspects of Paleolithic
adaptive systems, burials have seldom been the object of systematic study. Untestable attempts
to interpret the mortuary symbolism of extinct cultures have less potential value than docu-
mentation of the types and degree of variability in Paleolithic burials, which reflect indirectly
the sorts of social distinctions recognized by the societies of the deceased. Quantitative anal-
ysis of data available in the literature indicates, among other findings, that there are significant
differences in mortuary variables (and, by implication, in certain sociocultural variables) be-
tween Middle Paleolithic and Upper Paleolithic burials. (34)

Hartman, Dana (Museum of Northern Arizona) ARCHAIC ADAPTATIONS IN EAST CENTRAL
ARIZONA. During the 14 month period of September, 1976, to November, 1977, the Museum of
Northern Arizona mitigated 48 impacted sites along the Coronado Transmission Line in east
central Arizona. Several of these sites are Archaic food processing/camp sites with artifactual
assemblages characteristic of the Desert Culture. The transmission line traverses a number of
distinctive micro-environmental zones and, without exception, all of the mitigated Archaic
camps are associated with a specific environmental situation. The location of the Archaic
camps in areas of optimal environmental conditions often resulted in their ré-occupation during
Basketmaker/Pueblo times. (42)

Hassan, Afifa A. (Washington State) EVALUATION OF BONE FOR RADIOCARBON DATING.
Saat dates of bone collagen and apatite from several archaeological sites are compared
with other dates. The pure collagen yielded ages in the expected ranges. Amino acid analysis
served as a means to check the purity of the separated collagen and the reliability of the
techniques employed. Carbon isotope studies on modern and fossil bones and the associated |
sedimentary carbonate indicate post-mortem exchange of carbon in bone apatite. X-ray diffrac-
tion and infrared studies indicate post-mortem recrystallization of the bone mineral. The apatite
dates, in some cases, could be improved using the fractional hydrolysis technique. Our results
so far indicate that collagen and apatite bone dating can be significantly improved by adequate
Sample pretreatment. (6)

GROUPS; PREDICTIONS FROM AN ECONOMIC MODEL. A model based on cost-benefit anal-
ysis is used to produce predictions about resource mixes in subsistence economies. Environ-
mental information for three distinct time periods at one location in the Mimbres River Valley,
New Mexico, is organized within the framework of a site-catchment analysis. The results of the
site-catchment analysis are graphically depicted in the model as a series of potential yields for
various resource strategies in each time period. The predictions concerning resource use are
derived when prehistoric population size is considered with reference to the potential yields.
These predictions are then tested against the archaeological data. (36)

from Early Classic Kaminaljuyu, Guatemala indicates that obsidian production was internally

differentiated and specialized. The components of this industry are identified, and its structure
is reconstructed. At Kaminaljuyu, obsidian production, distribution, and consumption were in-
timately related to more general economic relationships, such as chiefly redistribution and
market exchange. An analysis of this industry thus provides information concerning the eco-
nomic structure of Kaminaljuyu. Furthermore, it suggests that the obsidian industry had im- .
portant influences on the development of Kaminaljuyu society. (27)

( The Lower Pomme de Terre River includes the important archaeological and paleontological
sites of Rodgers Shelter, and Phillips, Koch, Boney Springs, Trolinger and Jones Springs, all of
which occur in alluvium of three terraces (T-0, T-1, and T-2). Koch and Boney Springs alluvium,
f dating from 13,000 to more than 50,000 B.P., contains Rancholabrean faunas and no evidence
of early man. Archaeological evidence is confined to the Holocene deposits represented by
Rodgers alluvium (T-Ib), ca, 11,000 to 1,400 B.P., and Pippins alluvium (T-0), ca. 1,000 B.P. to the t
present. A major erosional episode occurs at ca. 8,000 B.P.; an erosional hiatus of 1,000 years .
occurs between 6,300 and 5,200 B.P.; and another of ca. 500 years occurs at ca. 1,100 B.P. Other
breaks in the radiocarbon chronology are not definitely related to erosional contacts. (26) ;

faunal and molluscan remains excavated from site H-CN-5 in 1976 provides the first detailed
information on the paleoecology of a Selin Period settlement in northeast Honduras. The Selin
site, located just north of Trujillo, and south of the Guaimoreto Lagoon, in the Department of
Col6n, reveals a prehistoric subsistence pattern that heavily exploited the rich local marine
resources, the lagoon estuary zone, and the forest fauna of the Agu&n River Valley and Hon-
duran interior. The report outlines the diversity of faunal and molluscan species recovered and
the respective changes in their representation through the seven century span of the Selin
Period (ca. 300-1,000 A.D.). (32)
Heisler, David M. (Southern Mississippi) ROMAN INFLUENCE OF THE PEOPLES OF SCOT-
LAND. Lowland Scotland was at times part of the Roman Empire; Highland Scotland was not.
Archaeological evidence indicates that life in the North was unaffected, except for the possible
migrations of peoples from southern England, forced north by Roman pressure. In the Lowlands,
romanization of native centers can be seen, but rural life remained largely unchanged. This
situation can be credited to the transient military nature of the Roman experience in Scotland.

Hester, Thomas R. (Texas-San Antonio) QUARRY SITES AND THE LITHIC PRODUCTION SYS-
TEMS OF SOUTH AND SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS. Chert quarries and quarry workshops in south
| central and southern Texas have been largely ignored by archaeologists. However, they con-
, stitute an important segment of the aboriginal settlement systems, and the analysis of these
sites has added greatly to our understanding of the prehistoric lifeways in these regions. In the
past several years, the author and colleagues at the UTSA Center for Archaeological Research
have conducted systematic studies of several quarry workshops. The role of these sites in the
settlement and lithic production systems is examined in this paper, Two distinctly different
quarry workshop systems are noted for the two regions, reflecting divergent lithic resources
and differing modes of resource exploitation. (33)
Hobgood, John (Chicago State) AZTEC AZT LAN AND THE GREATER SOUTHWEST. The first
recorded interest in rediscovery of Aztlan, traditional northern homeland of the Aztecs, is given
by Diego Duran in his account of the expedition sent by Moctezuma | (ruled 1440-1468) in search
of Chicomostoc. Another early post-Conquest account is given by Indians living near Casas
Grandes, identifying this great site as the ‘Casa de Moctezuma.” In later times the myth of .
Aztlan spread as far as the Moskogee Indians. These and other examples demonstrate the
powerful and dynamic influence of the Mesoamerican Great Tradition well into the Colonial |
period in the Greater Southwest. (37) |

Holloway, Richard G. (Texas A & M) ORGANIC RESIDUE ANALYSIS OF PREHISTORIC LITHIC
ARTIFACTS: AN EXAMPLE FROM HINDS CAVE, TEXAS. Many lithic artifacts recovered from
Hinds Cave, Texas, revealed the presence of organic residue presumably associated with use.
A small! sample of this residue was removed from each artifact and a large quantity of organic
debris was revealed, much of which was identifiable, some to the species level. Chemical tests
were conducted which indicated the presence of such plant remains as lignin and starch. The
use of this data, in conjunction with detailed edge wear analysis, yielded information concern-
ing both the duration of tool use and identification of the actual plants that were being pro-
cessed with these tools. (28)
Hommon, Robert J. (Hawaii State Historic Preservation Office) INLAND EXPANSION AND THE
FORMATION OF HAWAIIAN INCIPIENT STATES: A.D. 1400-1650. Data collected during the on-
going archaeological survey of Kaho'olawe island, including basaltic glass hydration-rind age-
determinations for most sites and features, allow testing of important aspects of a model of
incipient state formation in pre-contact Hawaii. The archaeological data of Kaho’olawe, Sup-
ported by fragmentary evidence from other Hawaiian islands, indicate a major inland expansion
of settlement and land use beginning ca. A.D. 1400. It is suggested that this group-wide inland
expansion had profound demographic, environmental and socioeconomic consequences that
may be directly related to the formation of incipient states by the mid-17th century. (14)
Hopkins, Nicholas A. (Autonoma Metropolitana-iztapalapa) OTOMANGUEAN LINGUISTIC PRE-
HISTORY. The development of Otomanguean, a major linguistic family of Mesoamerica, is
traced from the beginnings of its diversification in the Archaic. Recent linguistic research in-
cludes the first systematic reconstruction of Proto-Otomanguean phonology and lexicon, and
the first treatment of the languages in terms of innovations shared across the developing
subgroups. Ethnobotanical vocabulary of Proto-Otomanguean has been correlated with plant
remains from Tehuacan, part of the proposed homeland of Otomanquean. Phonological devel-
opments reflect the formation of regional subgroupings which correlate with archaeological
material. Loan words indicate contacts with Mixe-Zoque (Olmec). A homeland for Chiapanec-
Manguean is proposed. (49)

THE CERAMICS. Archaeological excavation has indicated that the Kingdom of Chimor on the
North Coast of Peru possessed a stratified society; this is further borne out by the evidence
from the ceramics manufactured by these people. At least two distinct classes or castes are
represented on the pottery; these are distinguished not only by the activities in which they are
engaged, but also by their dress and ornament and, in some cases, by their placement on
vessels representing Chimu buildings. Supporting data from the Spanish chronicles are also
presented. (9) 7
Hudson, Luanne B. (USC) ST. GEORGE AMIDST THE CLASSIC MAYA; SERPENT SLAYING AS
REPRESENTED ON CERAMIC VESSELS. An almost identical scene found on various Classic
Maya ceramic vessels is described and interpreted. Two serpent forms are represented: one is
of an undulating serpent whose body is pierced by a spear; the other is of a serpent's head.
Other vessels and sculptural forms with serpents depicted were also studied in order to deter-
mine if they could be separated into different categories. Based on the analysis, it is suggested
that: (1) this was a unique scene, (2) it was mythological, (3) the paired serpents represented
two distinct types, and (4) the scene was connected with some form of ancestral rite. (27)
Hunter-Anderson, Rosalind (New Mexico) THE RISE OF MATRIFOCALITY IN THE WESTERN

cality) in the WPR Is proposed. Initia! selective contexts for matrifocality occurred toward the
end of the Basketmaker Period (ca. 500-800 A.C.E.), derived from a shift from primary winter
dependence on live game and stored wild plants to more emphasis on horticultural food for
winter consumption. Archaeological correlates of attendant social organizational changes will
be discussed. (38)

cultural resources (both prehistoric and historic) to be found on Bureau of Land Management
holdings in northwestern New Mexico. The contract called for survey of 59 square miles (37,610
acres) leading to the location of 421 sites with 523 components of occupation. In addition, 267
isolated artifacts were recorded. Principally Archaic and historic Navajo sites were found with

The implications for such estimates are explored, and alternative methods for estimating pop-
ulation are suggested, based on additional ethnographic data. The social structural changes in
the village, as they are reflected in architectural changes, are outlined; the problems of under-

identifying variation that is temporally sensitive. Further analysis based on these statistical
manipulations is then possible. (40)
James, Steve R. (Utah) AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE IN THE UPPER REACHES
OF THE BLACK ROCK DESERT, NORTHWESTERN NEVADA. In the summer of 1976, the Bureau
of Land Management conducted a cultural resources survey at the foot of the Pine Forest Range
in the upper Black Rock Desert, an arm of Pleistocene Lake Lahontan., Although previous sur-
face archeology in the Black Rock Desert has yielded a number of early projectile points rep-
resentative of lacustrine adaptations of the Western Pluvial Lakes Tradition (9,000-6,000 B.C.),
the evidence from this survey indicates instead reliance upon springs after the desiccation of
the region. Within a short radius of a few springs, seven large lithic scatters and thirty smaller
ones were identified and recorded. Samples of the lithic artifacts and materials were analyzed
in terms of chronology, environment, and subsistence of the area. (5)

, archaeological discipline with a concomitant concern regarding the degree to which survey
data is adequate for making behavioral inferences. Data resulting from a survey recently con-
ducted in Tonto Basin, central Arizona, is examined with respect to particular population and
Spatial variables. The variables discussed are density, agglomeration, hierarchy, differentiation,

TIONSHIPS, OSAGE RIVER BASIN, WESTERN OZARK HIGHLAND. On Holocene-aged river ter-
faces Of the Western Osage River Basin, Missouri, a consistent relationship exists between soil
type and degree of soil profile development versus geologic age of the parent material and
topographic position. This relationship is seminal to soil-archaeologic relationships. Archaic
and Paleo-indian cultural materials, for example are not found jn situ in Udifluvent profiles, nor
may Woodland materials be expected within Eutrochrept profiles, excepting plow layers. Among
soils in the area, bottom lands (Entisols, inceptisols, Alfisols) had maximal nutrient potential
for Woodland horticulture, though other non-nutrient factors may have operated. (26)

the results of archaeological test excavations of three prehistoric sites in the Dry Lakes area
of the San Luis Valley. A cultural component was encountered in which profuse amounts of
fish bones were deposited. Identification of the bone revealed that a genus of fish (/ctiobus)
was represented which was not previously known to be native to Colorado. The present day
environmental conditions of the area are such that this fish could not survive. Assuming con-
ditions necessary to support an /ctiobus population, a close correlation is demonstrated be
tween the paleoenvironment and prehistoric settlement patterns. (47)

Josserand, J. K. (INAH) MIXTEC DIALECTOLOGY: INFERENCES FROM LINGUISTICS AND ETH-
NOHISTORY, Recent linguistic studies establish dialect areas and ordered phonological de-
velopments within Mixtecan; ethnohistory and linguistics collaborate to provide evidence for
dating phonological changes in the development of Mixtec dialects, and for testing hypotheses
relating to the socio-political dominance of certain centers (Teposcolula, Achiutla, Yanhuitlan,
Tututepec). The extent of dialect areas in early contact times may be documented through
archival research. Varieties of Mixtec encountered in early documents (especially 16th century)
are related to present-day Mixtec dialects. The propostition that the Teposcolula dialect was
imposed by scribes as a ‘standard’ variety in the central Mixteca Alta is investigated. (49)

Work under the direction of Dr. A. R. Kelly in what became Ocmulgee National Monument was
particularly important to central Georgia archaeology. The material excavated from Mounds A

Kasohko, Michael W. (Hawaii) HAWAIIAN SOCIAL UNIT BOUNDARIES AS ARTIFACTS. This
paper demonstrates a means of archaeologically defining primary and secondary localized
groups in Hawaii through the reconstruction of prehistoric boundary systems. Three bodies of
information were utilized: the ethnohistoric sources describing Hawaiian land division in gen-
eral, the original Hawaiian land grant descriptions and survey records for the specific areas,
and the distribution patterns of actual archaeological features (especially prehistoric trails).
The recognition of such land-social unit boundaries as artifacts holds great potential for the
archaeologist in approaching, synchronically and diachronically, problems of prehistoric Ha-
walian social, economic, and political organization. (14)

Kelley, Ellen Abbott (Su! Ross) SIPAPU AND PYRAMID TOO: THE TEMPLE OF THE CRYPT AT
ALTA VISTA, CHALCHIHUITES. The Temple of the Crypt at Alta Vista, originally a free-standing
tomb of a high status individual, later was incorporated into the basal platform of a two-story
temple. The temple itself was an elevated room, while the basement room contained the crypt.
The analogy to an above-ground rectangular kiva with a sipapu in the floor used as god-entry
is obvious. Superimposed constructions converted the structure into a stepped Mesoamerican
pyramid. This development suggests that some southwestern kiva-sipapu complexes are anal-
ogous to some Mesoamerican pyramid-tomb complexes and that both complexes have a com-
mon Mesoamerican origin. (37)

Kikuchi, William K. (Kauai Community College) THE EVOLUTION OF HAWAIIAN AQUACUL-
TURE. Hawailan aquaculture was a prehistoric native innovation. Its roots were to be found in
the development of irrigated agricultural pondfields. Architectonic aquacultural sites, whether
found as inland pondfields or along coastal areas, were simply considered to be extensions of
agricultural technology. The evolution of the pondfields and fishponds had a significant eco-
logical and cultural impact on the native society. Ecologically, pondfields and fishponds be-
came artificial estuaries enriching the natural riverine and marine environments. Culturally, their
evolution paralleled the development of the elite class and, increasingly, became one of the
symbols and manifestations of religious, political, and economic power. (14)

discusses ways that inventory information derived from general, environmentally stratified sta-
tistical samples can be brought to bear on specific land management applications. Archaeo-
logical site data for the Black-Cerbat ES were gathered using stratified, random sample inven-
tory methods, without direct regard to proposed project areas or grazing allotments per se. This
required that new analytical techniques be developed to give reliable impact assessments for
a wide variety of small, surface-modifying projects scattered over nearly 2 million acres. The
paper highlights the difficulties of using traditional types of cultural resource management
information in preparing highly specific, project-related ES input. (48) |
King, Frances B. (illinois State Museum) CULTURAL, CLIMATIC AND EDAPHIC FACTORS IN-
FLUENCING VEGETATION. Examination of the ‘presettlement” vegetation, as recorded by gov-
ernment surveyors in the early 1800's, finds many presently forested areas where vegetation
was recorded as ‘open barrens” or prairie, suggesting that some agent, probably fire, was
modifying the environment. Whether or not fire was intentionally used to manipulate the veg-
etation, the result was, at least in late Holocene time, a forest and prairie mosaic with large
areas of ecotone and more abundant and diverse plant resources than occur in similar but
undisturbed areas today. Based on more western analogs, the earlier “Hypsithermal” dry in-
terval was probably more open on the uplands with proportionately greater percentages of plant
resources concentrated in the river valleys and floodplains. (26)

King, James E. (illinois State Museum) BIOGEOGRAPHY OF THE WESTERN OZARK HIGH-
LAND: THE POLLEN EVIDENCE. By 12,000 years B.P., spruce and related “northern” species
disappeared from the western Ozarks, and were replaced by a mesic oak-dominated deciduous
forest that persisted until 8,500 B.P., when there was a climatic shift to the drier hypsithermal.
Declining forest density, replacement of mesic species by xeric, and the eastward migration of
the prairie/forest border characterizes the hypsithermal. About 5,500 8.P., increases in forest
density and declining herbs suggest the return of a more equitable climate. However, the con-
tinued absence of some mesic species indicates that the post-hypsithermal climate remained
somewhat dry, even to the present. (26)

Kirch, Patrick V. (Bishop Museum) ECOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVES ON PREHISTORIC HAWAIIAN
MARINE EXPLOITATION. While archaeologists in the Hawaiian field have provided a solid
framework in the typological analysis of the material culture of fishing, a broader and integrating
theoretical perspective is required. Stress needs to be laid on the definition of variability and
constraint in environment, and of cultural response to this ecological matrix. Functional anal-
yses of fishing gear, faunal analyses, and environmental studies of contemporary marine eco-
systems and resources are among the methodologies that can be integrated by an ecological
paradigm. Recent and continuing investigations in Hawaii provide a data base upon which the
appropriateness and utility of such a paradigm may be tested. (14)

Knoeri, John J. (SUNY-Binghamton) DATA RESOLUTION IN MEASURING SITE LOCATION IN
HEAVILY VEGETATED AREAS: METHODOLOGY AND TECHNIQUES. Archaeologists and plan-
ners require accurate measurement of parameters such as site size and intrasite variability for
research and management decisions. Often archaeological sites are located in situations where
measurement of these parameters is costly. Since resolution of data relevant to defining site
size and intrasite variability is a direct function of cost, the goal is to increase resolution while
reducing cost. Shovel test pits (cylinders 30 cm in diameter) placed at regular intervals provide
broad coverage and allow the observation of spatial data variation. Twelve sites in southeastern
New York State, representing a majority of the area's known site types have been subjected to
our shovel test pit methodology. The analysis shows great promise in increasing our ability to
estimate site size and intrasite variability. (13) ‘

is provided in this paper. Moreover, four primary processes of culture change are offered. They
are based on a valid analogy with the four basic mechanisms of biological (phylogenetic) evo-
lution, and their explication provides a basis for a unified genetic analogue mode! of culture
change. It is maintained here that archaeology can productively study culture change in view
of these concepts of the primary cultural processes. (6)
Kosakowsky, Laura (Arizona) LITHIC USE WEAR RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF ARIZONA.
This report discusses current research being carried out at the University of Arizona in lithic
use wear analysis. Previous lithic use wear research has almost universally suffered frorn two
major deficiencies: (1) the use of a single rock type for experimentation so that results are not
necessarily comparable to other rock types; and, (2) a lack of quantification of use wear so that
experimental data cannot be objectively related to prehistoric materials. Our research has fo-
cused on defining measurable attributes of rocks that determine the formation of lithic use
wear so that our results will not be limited to a single rock type. Furthermore, we are seeking
and experimenting with techniques that will allow the quantification of use wear. (25)

growth and non-growth, with associated demographic, hierarchical, and land use characteris-
tics. This is also true for the 550 km? just to the south, but the modes are not completely
synchronized with the central area. To explain this variability, a model based on optimal land

Lange, Richard C. (Arizona State Museum) SAMPLE CIRCLES: AN EFFECTIVE APPROACH TO
SAMPLING LARGE SURFACE SITES. Sample circles can perform several functions as part of
a sampling strategy for a site. As a form of sampling, this approach provides an alternative to
a 100% collection of extensive sites. Problems that can be addressed are: boundary definition;
assemblage composition, homogeneity, and distribution; and cluster size and location. Sample
circles are a particularly efficient means of dealing with such questions because they are easy
to establish and are amenable to collection by several techniques with varying degrees of
provenience control. (6)
Larraide, Signa (Denver) SHARED AESTHETIC TRADITIONS: POTTERY AND TEXTILE DESIGN
RELATIONSHIPS IN ARIZONA, 1100-1350. It was hypothesized that: (1) well-established regional
aesthetic traditions in Pueblo II! Arizona resulted in ceramic and weaving products with designs
similar to each other; (2) craftsmen in areas of cultural mix (i.e., Salado and Sinagua areas)
produced ceramics and textiles with designs unlike each other and like the original traditions
that inspired them. A design sample was coded using the Hatcher Art Analysis tally sheet.
Results indicated significant regional consistencies in major and minor symmetry, layout, color,
line and composition of design for both crafts except in areas of cultural mix, where these
consistencies in design did not occur. (38)
Leach, Helen M. (Otago-New Zealand) MIND WITHIN MATTER: DISCOVERING THE TECHNO- |
LOGICAL*“KNOWLEDGE OF EARLY NEW ZEALANDERS. The study of stone tools in New Zea-
land was long dominated by the classification of finished adzes whose varying patterns of flake
scars had been obliterated by polishing. Excavation of an argillite adze workshop in southern
New Zealand provided an opportunity for establishing the complete production sequence of
several adze ‘types.’ A jig-saw analysis of a silcrete blade-manufacturing site of the same people
showed that although production of prismatic cores involved a different procedure, similar skills
were evident. Thus, a comparison of two distinct production sequences reveals a common core
of stone working Knowledge probably shared by other early East Polynesians. (33)

Lees, William B. (South Carolina) FORM AND FUNCTION OF COLONO-INDIAN POTTERY IN AN
HISTORIC PLANTATION CONTEXT. During the historic period, various Southeastern Indian
groups are known to have produced a trade ware currently referred to as Colono-indian pottery.
The precise forms and socioeconomic correlates of this ware are as yet poorly understood. An
analysis of the intrasite variability of Colono-indian ceramics from the Limerick Plantation Site
(38BK223), an 18th and 19th century rice plantation in coastal South Carolina, was conducted,
with the resultant data being compared to that from other sites on which Colono-Indian wares
occur. This consideration of form and functional distribution Indicates, among other things, a
heavy reliance of Colonial and Ante-bellum populations of various ethnic origins on Colono-
Indian wares. (46)

Levy, Richard (Kentucky) THE LINGUISTIC PREHISTORY OF CALIFORNIA: A PROCESSUAL
VIEW. An argument is made for the use of historical linguistics in a processual frarmework.
Linguistic change in Central California is examined with respect to interaction among language
families and with respect to the social and ecological contexts in which linguistic change
occurs. Attention is focused on six language families (Pomo, Western Miwok, Costanoan, Yok-
uts, Sierra Miwok, Maidun) and the nature of the relations of these to each other and to the
ecological context during the process of change. The expansion of these six language families
is intimately associated with the cultural changes of the Late Horizon in Central California
prehistory. (11)
Lewenstein, Sue (Arizona State) AN ANALYSIS OF EXPERIMENTALLY PRODUCED EDGE DAM-
AGE ON OBSIDIAN BLADES. In order to determine the prehistoric function of obsidian blades
recovered from Classic period deposits on Patarata Island, Veracruz, Mexico, an experimental
sample of obsidian blades was manufactured and used to process a variety of raw materials
presumably exploited by early Mesoamerican coastal groups. Subsequent to use, edge damage
data were collected for all 165 experimental tools. Factor and discriminate analyses have been
successful in isolating wear patterns corresponding to several use categories. These results
suggest the possible function of the Veracruz assemblage, both in terms of raw material and
type of motion involved during use of the blades. (25)
Lewis, Kenneth E. (South Carolina) SETTLEMENT PATTERN AND FUNCTIONAL VARIATION OF
THE SOUTH CAROLINA FRONTIER. The evolution of frontier settlement in the interior of South
Carolina reflects adaptations to the attenuated social and physical environment present in the
area undergoing colonization. Regional economic and subsidiary centers of wheat production
were arranged in a dendritic pattern focused on the entrepot of Charleston and only with rare
exception did substantial settlements arise that were not linked with this network during the
frontier period. The archeological investigation of one linked center—Camden—and one non-
linked center—Long Bluff—reveals variations that might reflect the functional differences of
these two settlements. (2)

Lightfoot, Kent G. (Arizona State) FOOD REDISTRIBUTION IN THE PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST.
Recently several archaeologists have examined intra- and inter-community food exchange with-
in the prehistoric Southwest as a social process enabling people to subsist in an unpredictable
environment. Within any year the productivity of a given plot of land may vary significantly with
fluctuations in the pattern of rainfall, frost, wind, etc. The social networks linking communities
enable food to be distributed from areas of relative abundance to those of scarcity. The problem
posed in this paper is determining the maximum size of the social network in which food could
be redistributed efficiently on a regular basis. The cost of transporting food by foot over various
distances is used in determining this. (45)

Using such a framework in a preliminary form, the specific problem of differential utilization of
resource zones by prehistoric groups with differing productive technologies will be examined
using data from the riverine Midwest. (36)

SOUTHERN COAL PROJECTS OF UTAH: METHODS AND RESULTS OF ANALYSIS FOR TWO
LARGE-SCALE CONTRACTS. The amount and variety of data collected for the Central and
Southern Coal Projects of southern Utah from the sampling surveys and research on previously
recorded sites required implementation of computerized data storage and retrieval in order to
evaluate the effects of coal development on cultural resources. With the aid of cross-tabulations
for the various environmental and cultural variables, it was possible to produce statements on
culture history, ecological parameters of site location, and cultural affiliation of site types.
These data, when used in conjunction with the other basic research undertaken for the project,
resulted in predictive models of site type, location, cultural affiliation, and density given known
environmental setting. (20)

priate and that sources have been adequately characterized and will focus on the problem of
assigning artifact samples to sources. Several methods of assigning unknowns will be dis-
cussed and compared. The resulting data are then applied to a study of chert distributions on

archaeology, which will be of increasing import as cultural resources management responsi-

chaeology has long relied on techniques that disturb and often obliterate prehistoric remains,
research and applications of remote sensing have led to advances that make a non-destructive
orientation both feasible and efficient. The converging historical, professional, managerial, and
technological currents that influenced the development of this stance are defined, and conclu-
sions are drawn concerning the role of extractive techniques such as surface collecting and
excavation. (24)

and other ceramic traditions in western North America are explored. The pottery from these
sites and other sites along the upper courses of the Klamath and Rogue Rivers has been named

Valley shows this three color style to be of low frequency and contemporary with Chimu style
ceramics. The characteristics of the three color Red-white-black style are examined, and it is
found that although the style is a marker for the end of the Middle Horizon, it is not necessarily
an indicator of Huari/Pachacamac influence. (4)
Madsen, David B. (Utah) THE CONCEPT OF AN EARLY ARCHAIC: FACT OR FANTASY. Prelim-
inary results of survey and test excavations in the Deep Creek Mountains in west central Utah
| indicate occupation of the area by at least four prehistoric groups. A possible Paleo-Indian
occupation is tentatively suggested by lithic techniques. Archaic and Sevier (formerly termed
Fremont) occupations are found sequentially in test excavations of two rockshelters. A Goshute ;
occupation is known historically and may be represented by Paiute-Shoshonean pottery at
several sites. Dating of these sequences supports the thesis that there is no evidence of Archaic
cultures in the eastern Great Basin prior to 860 B.P. Surface finds of fluted points and the :
presence of large herbivores, such as mammoths at 10,000 8.P. or later suggests that early
. sites in the eastern Great Basin may well represent Paleo-Indian occupations, rather than Ar-
| chaic. (5) |

by range management considerations. An additional sample of 20,480 acres followed Mueller's
“cluster scheme” strategy, using the township-range system rather than cultural or environ-
mental criteria for stratification. This approach is economical, hypothetically provides a small-
scale replica of the universe being sampled, and allows a field test of Mueller’s site data ma-
. nipulations from the Paria Plateau (a part of the ES area). Analysis of the data uses Mueller’s

and between these regions. The concepts of the Desert Branch Hohokam, Ootam and Dragoon
cultures are reviewed, focusing on the problem of identifying the mechanisms (¢.g., migration
and trade) by which Hohokam cultural manifestations appear in these two regions. It is sug-
gested that substantial changes in social or subsistence patterns occurred at least three times
during the Hohokam cultural sequence. These are delineated and factors responsible for their

compared with those for the full sample of Pueblo I! and ill sites in this region, and with the

Mayer-Oakes, William J. (Texas Tech) BUREAUCRATS OR SCHOLARS—WHO CONTROLS AR-
CHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH? Most archaeological research in the U.S. today is funded by
Federal government agencies, as is most other scientific research. “Contract,” or applied, ar-
chaeology is not always high quality and has elicited adverse publicity. Antiquities laws are
being challenged. Some agencies request technical rather than professional services, foster
mistrust by inter-regional contracting or consider cost alone. Costs have escalated and basic
research declined as governmental regulation has increased. Archaeologists must counter
these trends and, as citizen-scientists, make individual commitments to providing bureaucrats
and the public with greater understanding of the need for well-managed, publicly funded re-
search, both applied and basic. (20)

sites of two known seasons of occupation and functions were mapped. Measures of interior
and total site space from these sites are used to test the proposition that summer occupied
sites vs have proportionately and absolutely less interior space on them than will winter oc-
cupied sites. Implications of the findings for interpretation of the archaeological record are
discussed. (22)

proached systematically and carefully. Much material from the excavation will be unique and
will require refined methods of collection, analytical management, and curation to yield as
much information as possible. (30)

Morse, Dan (Florida State) CASE REPORTS. There are many more skeletons found on the surface
tran buried. When these cases are investigated, in order to best "recreate the event,” care and
accuracy are required. For illustration, the cases of three skeletons discovered recently in Flor-

suicide, and in the third, murder. In.all cases, archaeological techniques were applied and
resulted in the recovery of significant information for the investigation of each case. (31)

TOMATLAN RIVER VALLEY, 1975-1977. From 1975 through 1977 research has been conducted
in the Tomatlan river valley of coastal Jalisco Mexico in order to recover information regarding
orehispanic occupation before sites were destroyed by the Caj6n de Pena dam and irrigation
project. Some 50 kilometers of the river valley were investigated and 165 sites recorded. The
Sites were mapped and sampled, and excavations conducted at six of them. The occupation of
the valley from at least 200 B.C. to A.D. 1579 is traced through four distinctive periods of
development which reveal some of the processes involved in the evolution of a coastal valley
cultural system. (40)
Myers, Thomas P. (University of Nebraska State Museum) THE FRINGES OF THE INCA EMPIRE.
While ecological boundaries contribute to a non-circular pattern of culture traits, political in-
tiuences, etc., human ecology rather than natural ecology is the critical variable. The expansion
of empire is founded upon the conquest of sedentary peoples who are bound in place by capital
investments in the modes of production. It follows that: (1) incorporation of developed areas is
the primary objective of empire expansion; (2) underdeveloped areas will surround the empire;
(3) underdeveloped regions within the empire were incorporated for strategic purposes. These
hypotheses are tested against data from the northern-and eastern edges of the Inca Empire, an
extreme example of linear configuration. (23)

, Neely, James A. (Texas-Austin) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE WS RANCH SITE, WEST CEN-
TRAL NEW MEXICO: THE 1977 SEASON. An intensive surface survey of the WS Ranch site
indicated its potential as a regional trade center and as a major occupation locus in the tran-
sition zone between the Pinelawn-Reserve and Mimbres Branches of the Mogollon. Test exca-
vations were initiated to evaluate these potentials at this large, apparently badly looted site.
The archaeological findings at this multicomponent site, occupied from about A.D. 800-1250,
are reported in this paper. A statement of objectives for continued excavations at the WS Ranch
site and a regional survey of the surrounding San Francisco River Valley and its tributaries will
be presented. (45)

Neily, Robert B. (SIU-Carbondale) COMMUNITY ADAPTATION AND CHANGE ON BLACK MESA.
A theoretical and methodological base is presented from which spatially distinct contempora-
neous sites may be grouped into interacting communities. The nature and extent of a com-
munity’s exchange spheres are seen as major factors in its capability to remain stable or,
alternatively, to adjust to external change factors. It is from this perspective that adaptation
and change on Black Mesa is examined. (22)

Nelson, Ben A. (SiU-Carbondale) THE PROBLEM OF HYPOCOHERENCE IN SYSTEMIC REOR-
GANIZATIONS PRECEDING THE NORTHERN BLACK MESA ABANDONMENT. The rapid but
orderly abandonment of an aboriginally occupied area implies prior stress of some form on or
within the cultural system. Given this proposition, the archaeological record should therefore
bear evidence of adaptive shifts in the period preceding the ca. A.D. 1150 abandonment of large
portions of Black Mesa. Such shifts would be reflective of the creation of additional buffering
mechanisms to enhance the survival probability of the system. Evidence relating to this hy-
pothesis is reviewed. It is argued that Rappaport's notion of hypocoherence may be valuable
in explaining the failure of the hypothesized systemic reorganizations, and consequently, useful
for interpreting the northern Black Mesa abandonment as an example of systemic maladaption.

Faunal analysis of sites within the Maya area pose problems not usually encountered elsewhere
in the hemisphere, There are extreme differences in elevation, climate, and ecological condi-
tions within a comparatively restricted geographical area. The vertebrates are of mixed Nearctic
and Neotropical origin. The avifauna is rather extensive due to the migratory flyway of the
Central American corridor, Humid soil conditions and the close proximity of some of the larger
Maya sites to large watercourses contribute to a considerable loss of bone material. These and
other problems that confront the zooarchaeologist are discussed. (3)
Olson, Gerald W. (Cornell) SOME PEDOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS OF SOILS IN MAYA AREAS
IN RELATION TO ARCHAEOLOGY. Soil characteristics which influenced and were modified by
Maya populations are emphasized in this paper, with examples from fieldwork at locations
mcluding Tikal (in Peten Region, Guatemala), San Antonio (on Rio Hondo, Belize), and Valle de
Naco (near San Pedro Sula, Honduras). Soils at each site were major resources that enabled
initial development of increasingly complex settlements; growth of social organizations re-
quired considerable modifications of the soils; finally the technology of the time proved limiting
to suStain the yields required from the soils to support the large populations. Pedological
evidences of erosion, sedimentation, disturbance, depletion, and enrichment contribute signif-
icantly toward understanding of past events at each Maya site. (10)

trom the excavation of Arizona Public Service site CS-49, a small pueblo in Central Arizona, are

that primary cultural behavior occurred in this area in addition to refuse deposition. Detailed
technological analysis of lithics aided in determining the plausibility of such activity. Further-
more, the presence of cultural features supports the premise of primary activity within the
mudden. It is therefore suggested that more emphasis be placed on nonarchitectural features
within habitation sites. (19)
Padgett, Thomas J. (Arkansas) PROBLEMS AND PROMISE OF THE SMALL-SCALE ARCHAE-

have inherent limitations that may restrict the usefulness of the data obtained. In the southeast,
various attempts have been made to construct regional or state wide research designs to guide
survey methodology and to provide interpretive frameworks for site survey data. Some of these
attempts have been characterized as ‘‘pseudo-science”’ by other workers in the area. Although
certain criticisms are justified, the potential for small scale surveys to generate data relevant
to regional problems should not be dismissed. The integration of site data is essential for the
formulation and revision of productive research designs. (39)

| LAKE ABERT, SOUTHEASTERN OREGON. The discovery of a dense cluster of pithouse villages
along the shores of Lake Abert, in southeastern Oregon, is reported. Evidence gathered in
! survey and test excavations strongly suggests that Lake Abert was the center of a lacustrine
and marsh-oriented society approximately 4,000 to 1,000 years ago when increased precipitation
made the lake and its drainage basin more biotically productive than today. This Chewaucanian
Culture shows adaptive similarities, and perhaps affiliations, with the lacustrine and marsh-
oriented Klamath and Modoc of the contact period. The significance of the Lake Abert discovery
to the prehistory of the Northern Great Basin is discussed. (11)

has been viewed as an organized movement of Hohokam families whose presence triggered
significant changes in local cultural developments. This paper reviews existing data and ques-

offered to explain the phenomenon. Additional archaeological data needed to test these hy-

did not choose the environments which were later extensively and intensively manipulated but
rather chose more diversified areas which allowed a greater range of natural flora and fauna to
be exploited. It further suggests that early Hawaiians did not rely primarily on marine resources
until horticultural self-sufficiency was achieved but rather also exploited in significant propor-
tions both bird and native vegetable products. (14)

analysis of the Rodgers fauna, a multivariate statistical study of subtle changes in bone mor-
phology through time was instigated. Modern skeletal squirrel (Sciurus carolinensis and S.

Rodgers from pre-hypsithermal to hypsithermal times, i.e. mexic to xeric regimes, corresponded
in direction to that discovered for modern squirrels. (26)

lines for evaluating the extent and direction of the biases in such uncontrolled samples are
suggested. (39)

by the early Hawaiians were not for want of trying but were limited by available technology and
social organization. This thesis is developed in greater detail, and the archaeological and other
relevant evidence for early Hawaiian impact on their island environment is examined and eval-

, Pecent experience, most of it in connection with federally-mandated historic resource surveys,
thas demonstrated that such disturbances are often quite superficial, and that important sites
and features may exist, intact, beneath them. In fact, since all human activity “disturbs” the
tocale in which it occurs, the evidence of past construction and destruction may be the very
resource that gives the area its historical and cultural importance. This paper presents examples
of successful recovery of archaeological data in urban contexts in the northeastern United
States, and discusses some special emphases and methodologies that are appropriate in these

“Shoshonean” fingernail-impressed pottery. The lower component, apparently 3,000 years old,
wecludes points comparable to Great Basin Archaic forms. The site is particularly important for
Ws excellent preservation of food remains—mussel shells; hackberry seeds; deer, rodent, bird,

7900) can be described as closed, isolated, and self-sufficient. During the third and fourth (1900-
7840 and 1940-1955), Plainville underwent significant sociocultural changes. Modern technolo-
oy. increasing control by federal government and the process of “urbanization” were all external
forces contributing to opening Plainville to the outside world. During the fifth period (1955-1977),
which is most crucial, Plainville can be best described as a “retirement community” threatened
by the culture and values of" foreigners.” (26)

growth was probably limited by density dependent factors such as carrying capacity. Because
social factors or available building space may impose limits at individual sites, an attempt will
be made to examine growth patterns in clusters of sites at the regional level. This level would
seem more appropriate for discussion of limits to growth based on Carrying capacity. (30)

suited to an eight-hour day. Second, this mercenary attitude is frequently coupled with a decline
in individual competence. Frequently, large projects must initially function as field schools, an

Roproaches to the analysis of spatial distribution of artifacts have, however, often lacked a
coherent methodological framework. It is suggested that geographic methodologies could fa-
omMiate empirical generalizations and serve as a basis for further systematic modeling of in-
wasite activity areas. Varying methods of cartographic depiction and centrography are applied
e the problem of intrasite spatial analysis. Examination of the ability of these techniques to
@ter the portrayal of a statistical surface is discussed. Particular emphasis is placed upon the
ese of these techniques as foundations for deductive modeling to aid in archaeological expla-
nation. The well established use of these methods in geographic research constitutes a previ-

ysis was conducted on lithic assemblages collected from a series of habitation and limited
activity sites located near Payson, Arizona, Quantification of hinge and invasive fractures per
artifact according to a 6-polar grid constituted the major portion of the microwear analysis.
Quantification was necessary to differentiate modes of use, relative hardness of the material
worked and modes of manufacture. Factor and cluster analyses grouped artifacts according to
the degree of accumulated damage. Supplementary data (i-e., pollen, distributional, ecological)
were used to differentiate further activity sets that varied as to site type and environmental

wter-assemblage variability is limited. Formal tool classes and debitage reflect an emphasis
on hunting and plant processing, even during periods when agricultural intensification is
fought to have occurred. The site is interpreted as a limited activity locus which was occupied
with greater frequency during A.D. 1200-1400. These data tend to validate models emphasizing
‘creased wild resource extraction during the late prehistoric period when domesticated plant

Tartaglia, Louis James (California State-Northridge) EARLY PREHISTORIC SHOSHONEAN
CONTACTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. Analysis of the Chatsworth cairn site suggests that
it represents one of the earliest Shoshonean occupations (mourning ceremony site) in southern
Salifornia (400 B.C.-A.D. 800). The Shoshonean mourning ceremony is a commemoration cere-
77
, mony for either specific important individuals or for all the individuals that died the previous
year. Cremated reburials are indicative of this specialized mortuary practice for high status
individuals; thus, the nonrandom patterning of associated artifacts indicates ascribed status.
Central and peripheral activity areas are defined based on the spatial distribution of trade
materials and pH soi! testing. Astronomical alignments of projectile points support the cardinal
directions ethnographically recorded with the Shoshonean mourning ceremony. (11)

Terrel, James A. (Eastern New Mexico) QUANTITATIVE ARCHITECTURAL ANALYSIS AT GUAD-
ALUPE RUIN, SANDOVAL COUNTY, NEW MEXICO. A methodology for recordation of architec-
tural variability has been developed from previous research. The approach incorporates both
traditional aspects of architectural analysis, |.e., masonry typologies, abutment studies, etc.,
and more recent developments, i.e., architectural attribute analysis. Utilization of the method
provides a quantitative basis for the estimation of stabilization requirements and allows the
use Of multivariate statistical procedures for the delineation of architectural subpopulations.
Data from excavation and analysis of cultural materials may be used to test defined subpopu-
lations for cultural significance. Application of the method at Guadalupe Ruin provides a back-
ground for discussion of the sampling procedures, attributes measured, and the problems and
limitations of the method. (15)

Reese River and Monitor valleys have disclosed a relatively stable upland subsistence-settle-
ment system which began about 7,000 to 8,000 years ago, and survived into the ethnographic
present. Earlier settlements in the central Great Basin are known to have clustered about Pleis-
tocene remnant lakes, and a recent systematic random sampling survey was conducted to
determine the nature and extent of these Paleo-indian settlements near Pleistocene Lake Ton-

artifact analysis and microwear studies. The paper concludes with some preliminary notions
about the major settlement shift from lowland to highland occupations in the central Great

Torrence, Robin (Sheffield) PRODUCTION FOR EXPORT AT THE MELIAN OBSIDIAN QUARRIES.
Wetually all the obsidian found on prehistoric sites in the Aegean c. 9,000-3,000 B.P. was initially
‘quarried at one of either of two source areas on the Cycladic island of Melos. Identifying the
‘Sehavior recorded at these quarry sites is important because it should reflect the constraints
operating on the exchange system as a whole. Quantitative and qualitative study of the debitage
@t Sta Nychia and Dhemenagaki has demonstrated that prismatic blade core preforms (macro
ores) were the major quarry products. Differences in activity patterns between and within
workshop areas have been investigated in the field and with computer mapping routines. Es-

ethnography in the description and presentation of North American culture history. “History”
has assumed responsibility only for historic European remains. Therefore, we must ask who is
concerned with the proto-historic and ethnographic periods. There is no ethnographically ori-
ented program within current cultural resource management project designs or funding priori-
ties. Thus, an apparent result of the cumulative antiquities legislation has been to formally
exclude ethnographers and to diminish new ethnographic research in conjunction with cultural
resource management. Is this wise? (12)
Walker, Geoffrey (Michigan) HUMAN IDENTIFICATION: QUANTIFICATION AND RECOGNITION
OF SKULL FRAGMENTS IN FORENSIC ARCHAEOLOGY. Human bone analysis concerns age,
sex, and ethinic group classifications, and depends on their state of preservation. Graves are
grouped into two types: (1) ancient burials—identification and reconstruction of living forms is
more an art than a science in this area, (2) modern burials—favorable conditions for cranial
patterns make it possible to compute sex, age, and ethnic background. Our data is best suited
to discriminate between blacks, whites, and Indians. Our method will compute the size and
shape of missing skull fragments and build a complete skull representation within known limits.
Though human variation causes some questioning of the reliability of these methods, they
provide a powerful tool for recognition and classification, improving as data accumulates, and
providing the forensic archaeologist with a compass in a biological and sociological wilderness.

The proportions that the various species contributed to the sample is a measure of the inter-
action of the site with the rest of the Assyrian Empire. Changes in the animal management

TION. The relationship between features in cultural context and features in archaeological
context is conceptualized by applying concepts from Information Theory. This conceptual
framework examines the nature of information about human behaviors encoded in cultural
context and how this information is encoded in patterns of organization manifested in an ar-
chaeological feature population. The applications of this conceptual framework to the analysis
of Middle Archaic archaeological features excavated from the Koster Site are examined with
emphasis upon generating inferential models as a means by which human behaviors can be
inferred from spatially related patterns of feature organization. (6)
Wood, J. Scott (USDA Forest Service) THE SALT RIVER RECREATION PLAN: CULTURAL RE-
SOURCE AND LAND USE MANAGEMENT IN THE TONTO NATIONAL FOREST, ARIZONA. This
paper discusses the archaeological aspects of a long term land management program for the
Salt River Recreation Area on the Tonto National Forest, Arizona. Archaeological input into the
84
, ore-planning or evaluative stage of management programs |s emphasized. This process involves
the inventory and assessment of cultural properties, evaluation of impacts, and formulation of
enagement plans compatible with multiple and dominant uses. Objectives are seen as pro-

_#iding protection for both cultural and natural resources. Pre-planning evaluative input is seen

es the most effective method for long range management and protection of cultural resources.

Woods, William |. (SIU-Edwardsville) FIELD TUNNEL EROSION—A MESOAMERICAN EXAMPLE.
Evidence of dramatic site alteration by a distinctive subsurface erosional process was observed
@uring the 1975 Puebla Preclassic Project. Termed field tunnel erosion, or piping, this phenom
enon has been previously reported for a variety of non-site agid and semiarid locales. In site
comtexts, the process can result in both the selective removal of subsurface cultural horizons
anc in situ artifact modification. The archaeological significance of field tunnel erosion is
Sscussed utilizing an example from the Puebla Valley. (40)

Word, James H. (Texas Archeological Society) THE CONSERVING AMATEUR EVALUATES
PROFESSIONAL ARCHAEOLOGY, The amateur or avocational archaeologist must assume an

_ gttitude of responsibility by working with professional archaeologists and the general public to

- ssure the protection of information contained in archaeological sites. Many times this neces-

| sary situation requires the amateur to go an additional mile to help the professional archaeol-
‘agist inform the interested citizenry about the whys, hows, and the results of investigations.
Suggestions are offered about how the vocational archaeologist can better integrate with the
people who support archaeology. (1 8)

Wyckoff, Lydia L. (Yale) SOUTHWESTERN NICARAGUA: A STUDY OF CHANGE. An analysis of
*sunal and molluscoid remains found in association with Middle and Late Polychrome Period
etifacts will be presented as it provides information as to the subsistence practices during

_ @hese periods, Furthermore, it will be noted that the faunal and molluscoid remains are in
‘pverse proportions during these two periods with the greatest quantity of faunal remains as-
sociated with the Late Polychrome Period. It is hypothesized that this pattern is the result of
evironmental and cultural change. (32)

Yesner, David R. Maine) CARIBOU EXPLOITATION IN INTERIOR ALASKA: PALEOECOLOGY OF
THE PAXSON LAKE SITE. Study of caribou exploitation sites is relevant to understanding: (1)
saditional subarctic hunting patterns, (2) response of hunter-gatherers to changing game mi-
gration patterns, (3) efficient use of the tundra-forest ecotone, and (4) Upper Paleolithic mega-
Ssunal exploitation, particularly with reference to caribou. To this end, detailed faunal analysis
‘4s undertaken from the Paxson Lake site in interior Alaska. Dental eruption sequences indicate
‘/)-winter site usage conforming to present availability of the Nelchina herd. Dental wear pat-
*erns indicate unexpected concentration of older caribou. These data suggest primary site
wsage for clothing fabrication, confirmed by anin situ bone awl production sequence. (47)
