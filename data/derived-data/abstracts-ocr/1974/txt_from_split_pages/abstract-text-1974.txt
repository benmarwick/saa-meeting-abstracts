, ABSTRACTS OF ORGANIZED SYMPOSIA
(1, 2} ENVIRONMENT AND BEHAVIOR AT ANTELOPE HOUSE, CANYON DE
CHELLY, ARIZONA. Using concepts of behavioral archaeology as a unifying theory, data
from the recovered vegetal and artifactual array are used to test models explaining social
group behavior, site location, subsistence, abandonment, and natural resource utilization.
The perishable artifacts are reviewed for implications pertinent to inter-space and intra-site
social structure and social group relationships. Diachronic dimensions of the above problems
are discussed, with emphasis on changes within the Pueblo III time period.
(3) ROLES OF THE STATE ARCHAEOLOGIST: PROBLEMS AND PROSPECTS. One
significant aspect of public archaeology is the development of the role of state archaeologist
to various capacities of research, coordinating state programs, site preservation, data
collecting, and public interpretation. Six state archaeologists review current programs trom
different administrative viewpoints. Each summarizes the problems and program administra-
tion from data analyzed from ail other state archaeologists in the same administrative
setting. The discussion following the papers will concentrate on common needs and
developments in the public sector.
(4) CENTRAL PLACE THEORY AND OTHER LOCATIONAL MODELS IN ARCHAE-
OLOGY. Network and locational analysis and, more specifically, Central Place Theory have
become more common in archaeological modeling of settlement systems. Although the
integration into anthropological theory of a model that was originally the product of
geographers is desirable, many archaeologists are apprehensive that a model originally
designed to approximate a twentieth century urban industrial settlement system has not
been adequately evaluated. The symposium explores the applicability of CPT to archaeology
with data from a number of geographical areas.
(5) SOUTHEASTERN WOODLAND STUDIES: NEW DIRECTIONS. The Woodland period
of Southeastern prehistory has long been a major concern of regional archaeologists.
Traditionally, there has been a preoccupation with the construction of detailed regional and
local culture histories based upon ceramic seriation and lithic typology. Utilizing these
previous studies as a base, there has recently emerged a new perception of the Woodland
traditions in the Southeast. Stress is now being placed upon environmental studies, systems
analysis and culture process. The papers offered in this symposium present a sample of
current research directed toward these new goals.
(9) Symposium: THE PASSING OF THE PUBLIC DOMAIN IN ALASKA: CHANGING
PATTERNS OF LAND OWNERSHIP AND THE FUTURE OF ALASKA ARCHAE-
OLOGY. This past year two-thirds of the archaeologists applying for permits to do
fieldwork in Alaska were unable to obtain them. This was in part due to the pending land
selections under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (increasing the number of agencies
and organizations involved) and also to the fact that the present situation requires permit
applications to be submitted much earlier than was necessary in years past. If there is to be a
future for the past in the north, archaeologists must keep themselves informed of the rapid
changes taking place regarding land ownership and management. They must also formulate a
unified plan of action that will result in professional input to decision-making agencies
throughout the state and nation. This symposium is to serve as a working session for the
dissemination of information on how best to coordinate efforts prior to fieldwork, to
acknowledge present and potential problems, and to present possible solutions to these
problems,
(10) SPATIAL ANALYSIS IN ARCHAEOLOGY: THEORY AND PRAXIS. It is the intent
of this symposium to provide a forum for the interaction of both archaeologists and
geographers engaged in similar aspects of spatial analysis. Emphasis is on the development
and application of new modes of spatial analysis. The present importance and future
potential of the computer as a useful tool in the analysis of spatial distribution is stressed as
well.
(11) MOUND 72 AT THE CAHOKIA SITE: SOCIAL STRATIFICATION AND E X-
CHANGE IN THE FAIRMOUNT PHASE A.D. 900 to 1050. The most elaborate burial
mound ever excavated for the Cahokia site is known as Mound /2. This symposium presents
an analysis of the unique features of the mound, the burial patterns, the biology of the
populations represented, the description and distinction of the artifacts, and a summary of
the implications in terms of social stratification at the Cahokia site and economic exchange
with other areas of the United States during the time.
(12) THE LATE INTERMEDIATE CHIMU OCCUPATION OF THE NORTH COAST OF
PERU. Recent investigations at Chan Chan, in the Lambayeque and Chira River Valleys,
have shed new light upon the emergence of the Chimu state and its expansion as reflected in

17
, ceramics and settlement patterns. This symposium emphasizes ceramic seriation, the growth
of Chan Chan and its social and political organization, and the Chimu domination of the
Peruvian coast from Trujillo to Talara.
(14) SMITHSONIAN CONFERENCE ON BIOLOGICAL AND BIOGEOGRAPHICAL
MODELS IN ARCHAEOLOGY. A conference on theoretical biology and human Dio-
geography as applied to archaeological interpretation of hunter-gatherer, horticultural, and
complex societies took place 2? days priar to the SAA meeting. Held at the Smithsonian and
sponsored by the Smithsonian and the Wenner-Gren Foundation, the conference in-
vestigated the degree of correspondence between human and non-human biological systems
and the causes of cultural uniformity and diversity. Although the working sessions are
closed, a final summation of the conference is being held as an open session for the SAA
membership on Thursday evening. Conference participants were invited to attend the SAA
sessions and to take part in the proceedings.
(15, 16) NEW PERSPECTIVES ON THE EARLY INTERMEDIATE PERIOD OF
PERU—Part |: North and Central Coast and Highlands. Part |}: South Coast and Sierra, The
symposium seeks to outline new directions of cultural complexity during the Early
intermediate period, particularly in economic, demographic, and political domains. Though
variations of style are important and need to be discussed, there is an overriding interest in
process, and in asking questions such as when and under what conditions do various
socioeconomic changes take place, etc.
(17, 18) THE INDIVIDUAL IN PREHISTORY: STYLE VARIABILITY IN TECH-
NOLOGY. Recent analyses indicate the feasibility of isolating individual style variability
(both conscious and unconscious) in the manufacture and use of prehistoric artifacts. A
variety of quantitative analyses employing ceramics, lithics, and basketry illustrate current
promising results, as well as methods, techniques, and difficulties encountered in such
analyses. It is suggested, and partially demonstrated, that this research is important with
regard to delineating prehistoric residence units and patterns, degrees of craft specialization,
exchange systems, trade routes, seasonal population movements, and other aspects of
societal organization and change. And it may provide a direct measure of Numan
physiological stress. Attention is also given to the nature and determinants of style
variability in general, including consideration of the psychological and cognitive aspects of
learning.
(19) TRADE AND COMMUNICATIONS IN NORTHEASTERN NORTH AMERICA, A
series of papers are presented on prehistoric trade and communications systems as they
operated in the northeastern portion of North America. An emphasis is placed on the
mechanisms by which these systems operated and on the accommodations necessitated
within the donor and recipient cultural manifestations. The last 3000 years of prehistory are
considered as a unit and the suggestion is made that the system practiced during the earliest
phases of European trade was modeled on the traditional system of the area.
(20) CULTURAL AND NATURAL PATTERNING OF FAUNAL REMAINS. Faunal
remains uncovered in archaeological contexts reflect cultural patterns that are the result of
conscious of unconscious human decisions, Natural factors that may cause the subsequent
removal or destruction of bone, however, may serve to mask such patterns, and, in cultural
reconstructions, must be taken into account. The purpose of this symposium is to examine
both cultural and natural factors in some detail. Emphasis is focused on observational and
ROR TIVE AS SOR Sees rather than studies that take excavated faunal assemblages as their
starting point, the comparative data are presented that are drawn from several part or
full-time extant hunting and gathering societies,
(24) THE THUNDERBIRD ARCHEOLOGICAL PARK AND MUSEUM AND RELATED
RESEARCH. The development and the results to date of an integrated multidisciplinary
research program into the prehistory, geomorphology, and paleoecology of the Middle
Shenandoah Valley and adjacent areas are presented. Emphasis in the presented papers is on
the aims, methods, and techniques of the multidisciplinary program and the results to date.
Also included are a discussion of the conception and development of the Thunderbird
Archeological Park and Museum and its Visitors and Research Center, and the roles of
landowners, amateur archaeologists, and students in archaeological, pedological, geological,
and paleoecological research.
(25) ANALYSIS OF SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS ON OCCUPATION FLOORS. An
increasing number of archaeologists are plotting the distributions of artifacts and other
items on excavated “living” or ‘‘occupation floors.”’ It is generally hoped that the analysis of
these floor plots will reveal something of the patterns of human activities at these sites in
the past. This is to be accompanied by the isolation of ‘‘tool kits’’ and ‘“‘activity areas”’ from
the patterns of spatial distribution of materials on these floors. This symposium aims to
critically review and assess the models and the methods whereby we currently attempt to
attain these goals.
(31) PROBLEMS IN SALVAGE ARCHAEOLOGY. Salvage archaeology creates major
problems in the current archaeological picture of research in anthropology, The methods
and theories utilized require modification of those that apply to research planned around
18
, sites chosen for their content and/or expected content. Further, this type of research
pertains to lands which may or may not contain archaeologically significant materials. The
proposed symposium consists of papers discussing various topics and orientations. These
relate to salvage situations encountered in the eastern United States as well as elsewhere.
Handsman describes the salvage situation in Pennsylvania and the Potomac River area; Marian
White and Neil Trubowitz describe the political and strategic facets of salvage work in New
York and certain factors that are of national import; Fred Plog describes theoretical issues in
the SUNY, Binghamton salvage program, while Eugene Sterud indicates methodological
considerations of this program; Ellis McDowell provides some general considerations that
apply to salvage archaeology in any area, with specific reference to Maryland, Virginia, West
Virginia, and New York.
(32) CURRENT APPLICATIONS OF SCIENTIFIC ANALYSIS TO THE STUDY OF
ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS: SOME EXAMPLES FROM PRECOLUMBIAN MESO-
AND SOUTH AMERICA. This symposium attempts to present ‘“‘state of the art”
applications of scientific analytical techniques to archaeological materials. Emphasis is
placed on the presentation of the assumptions and parameters of the analytical methods
considered: on the role of data manipulation in arriving at and maximally utilizing the
analytical results; on the frequent advantage in applying several complementary analytical
techniques to the same body of archaeological material; and, generally, on the anthro-
pological knowledge that can be gained through the judicious use of chemical and physical
studies of archaeological materials. The relationship between archaeologists and natural
scientists involved in such interdisciplinary research, from the planning stage through
publication, is also considered. No attempt is made to cover all archaeological materials or
analytical methods, the emphasis being rather on specific cases of the productive utilization
of analytical techniques in ongoing research in Meso- and South American Precolumbian
studies.
(33) CONTRIBUTIONS OF PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL
INTERPRETATION. Many of the questions now being asked by archaeologists concerning
settlement patterns, migrations, and population origins and evolution are essentially
biological questions that necessitate biological answers. Using recent methodological
advances, physical anthropologists can now begin to provide such answers, assuming
adequate samples can be obtained. This symposium presents specific examples of how
method and theory in physical anthropotogy has been applied to the solution of certain
anthropological! problems and discusses the prerequisites and limitations of such research.
(34) WEEDEN ISLAND-ISM IN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES—NEW PER-
SPECTIVES. Over the last 2 decades archaeological research on the Southeast coastal plain
has given the term Weeden Island expanded meaning. Weeden Island has come to refer toa
ceremonial or sacred ceramic series, a ceremonial religious complex, a secular or utilitarian
ceramic series, and at least 4 geographically distinct cultures. The 4 cultures, Cades Pond in
north-central Florida, Wakulla Weeden Island in the Alabama-Georgia-F lorida tri-state area,
Gulf coast Weeden Island, and coastal plain Weeden Island, inhabited mutually exclusive
environmental zones, yet shared a quite similar ceremonial life. The multi-concept of
Weeden Isiand is examined, and descriptions, comparisons, and interpretations of village life
and ceremonialism are made.
(35) PREHISTORY OF THE MOJAVE DESERT REGION, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
The vast Mojave Desert has been inhabited at least since post-glacial times. Until recently, no
coordinated program of research has been carried out in the desert. This symposium will
present a synthesis of archaeological, ethnographic, and paleoenvironmental data from
recent research in the eastern and western portions of the Mojave Desert, and a testable
model of prehistoric adaptations to the changing environments in each area, and for the
desert as a whole.
(37) ADAPTIVE STRATEGIES IN BIOLOGICAL AND CULTURAL TRANSITION
ZONES: EXAMPLES FROM A CENTRAL ARIZONA ECOTONE. Little attention has deen
paid by archaeologists to cultural boundary situations and those who have usually suggest
cultural boundaries are relatively coterminous with environmental boundaries. Not much
consideration is given to the Causative factors regarding this fit of cultural and
environmental boundaries, except to suggest that the reasons are due to “cultural
adaptation.”” This symposium examines, from a number of points of view, the interface
between cultures and between cultures and environment in major environmental transition
zones, or ecotones. The study area is in central Arizona in the ecotone between the Upper
and Lower Sonoran life zones and the cultural contact is between the prehistoric Pueblo and
Hohokam.
(38) THE KOSTER SITE: A STRATIFIED ARCHAIC SITE IN THE CENTRAL
MISSISSIPP! VALLEY AREA. Since 1969, James Brown and Stuart Struever of
Northwestern University, together with a number of collaborators in archaeology and the
natural sciences, have been excavating the Koster site located in the !Hinois valley, 50 milés
north of St. Louis, Major excavations have been conducted in 10 stratified cultural units,
with limited work completed on the 11th habitation level. The subject of this symposium is
19
, ;
reports and interpretations by various cooperating investigators in the Koster project. A
synthesis of the cultural and environmental evidence is attempted and a broader
interpretation of Archaic adaptations in the central Mississippi drainage is presented.
(39) APPROACHES TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY. Recent interest in the
chemical analysis of archaeological materials has become great, and a number of reports of
analytical results have appeared in the literature. However, almost no standardization has
been attempted in the reporting of these results, and there has been little standardization of
the results themselves, Papers at this symposium are devoted to: (1) brief descriptions of
several analytic studies of artifact materials; and (2) proposals for improved techniques for
reporting and comparing analytic results in archaeology. It is hoped that the authors,
discussants, and interested members of the audience generate in discussion some initial
guidelines toward standardization. |
(40) QUANTITATIVE FAUNAL ANALYSIS. A commonly occurring problem in the
analysis of faunal materials either from regions or from individual sites is the quantification
of materials in such a way that more meaningful interpretations of prehistoric subsistence
activities can be achieved. The symposium is constructed to explore both new techniques
for handling faunal materials and new interpretations of prehistoric subsistence patterns.
Data from several major ecological zones of North America are used as illustrative material,
thus allowing a comparison of the application of techniques in different environments.
Cautionary strictures are stressed as well as new approaches. Format of Symposium: Several
20-minute papers, interrupted by a 20-minute intermission, and followed by 2 20-minute
discussions by 2 discussants and a few short concluding remarks by the symposium
chairmen.
(43) THE USE OF COMPUTERS TO SOLVE LOGISTIC AND OTHER NON-
STATISTICAL PROBLEMS. Archaeologists often use computers for statistics, but neglect
other potential applications. These applications include storage and retrieval of information;
finding and remedying discrepancies in existing collection archives; inventorying large
collections; making direct measurements from specimens and maps; keeping track of other
material in the field; preparing and up-dating dictionaries of current terms; interactive
mapping; preparation of final maps from stored information. Many of these applications are
based on the SELGEM system or are designed to be compatible with it. The SELGEM
system was originated and developed by the tnformation Systems Division of the
Smithsonian Institution. Participating Institutions: Eastern New Mexico University, South-
western Anthropological Computer Consortium, Arizona State Museum, U.S. Forest
Service, iInter-Mountain Regional Division, Washington State University, Northwestern
University, University of California, Santa Barbara, Smithsonian Institution Information
Systems Division, University of Kansas, Arizona State University.

Ackerman, Robert E. (Washington S), ARCHAEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATIONS IN
SOUTHEASTERN ALASKA, 1973. During the 1973 field season, members of the Icy Strait
Archeological Research project of Washington State University, returned to the Juneau
region of Southeastern Alaska to continue further excavations at the 9000-10 ,000-year-old
GHB 2 site, conduct an archaeological survey of the mainiand to the west and east of the
GHB 2 area, obtain ethnohistorical data relevant to the survey area, and investigate the
geochronology of the region by study of terrace relationships. This report presents in
summary form the results of the field investigations, the preliminary analysis of the data,
and the significance of the findings to northern Northwest Coast prehistory. (28)
Adovasio, James (Pittsburgh), THE IDENTIFICATION OF INDIVIDUAL STYLE VARI-
ABILITY IN BASKETRY MANUFACTURE, A series of measurements on isolated
manufacturing and stylistic attributes seems to provide a basis for distinguishing the
workmanship of individual prehistoric basketmakers. Moreover, the same techniques allow
for the delineation of separate populations of prehistoric basketmakers in any given locality
when perishables are numerous and well controlled chronologically. (18)

Aikens, C. Melvin, and David L. Cole (Oregon), DIRTY SHAME ROCKSHELTER, S.E.
OREGON. The Dirty Shame Rockshelter is located in dissected lava plateau country on the
edge of the Northern Great Basin in Malheur County, Oregon, near the juncture of the
Oregon, Nevada, and |daho boundaries. A dry deposit approximately 2 meters deep,
estimated on grounds of artifact typology to span 7000-8000 years, was excavated during
July and August of 1972. The few Great Basin sites for which detailed environmental, as
well as cultural information has so far been obtained are all caves located near the shores of
now-extinct Pleistocene lakes. The Dirty Shame investigations were undertaken to obtain
detailed environmental and cultural information from an upland, non-lakeshore situation,
and thus to provide a perspective on human ecological relations in an environmental context
heretofore inadequately investigated in the Great Basin region. Preliminary results of the
investigation are reported. (238)
Allen, Ralph O. (see Luckenbach, Alvin H.) (39)
Anawalt, Patricia (UCLA), PAN-MESOAMERICAN COSTUME DISTRIBUTION AT THE
TIME OF SPANISH CONTACT, Itis the contention of this paper that the same basic forms
of costume, differing only regionally, were worn over all of Mesoamerica at the time of
Contact. This hypothesis is investigated through examination and comparison of pan-
Mesoamerican regional styles. Costume examples are drawn from extant codices, and these
data are analyzed using a method of abstract costume analysis. Garments are dealt with in
terms of the basic principles around which they are constructed, the forms they take, and
the utilitarian functions they serve. Comparative diagrams illustrate both regional variation
and pan-Mesoamerican similarities of dress. (6)
Anderson, James (Cahokia Mounds Mus), THE EXCAVATION AND STRATIGRAPHIC
DATA FROM MOUND 72. Mound 72 was excavated because of its unique shape and
orientation. These factors dictated the original excavation strategy. As a result, a post pit
where a marker had been located was found. Following this, excavations into the mound
proper suggested that it had been built in a series of sequential stages of smali platform
mounds that were ultimately connected together to form one large ridge-topped mound.
What had been planned as a single season or two of excavation expanded into a 5-year
project that has completed most of the excavation of Mound 72. (11)
Angel, J. Lawrence (Smithsonian), SOCIAL BIOLOGY AND THE ARCHAEOLOGIST. The
Eastern Mediterranean from the end of Wurm glaciation to the present was ecologically
challenging and varied (rainfall, soils) and historically critical (population density change,
mixture, inventiveness). There is a striking time correlation between female longevity,
reproductive efficiency, population density, biological heterogeneity, disease, and historical
rise or decline. Human biology and culture are inseparable and archaeologist and physical
anthropologist must work together closely. Skeletons are seldom well preserved and demand
care. Each site, such as Lerna (Jack Caskey), Mycenae (George Mylonas), or Karatas
21
, (Machteld Mellink) shows a different social biotogical picture: movement of genetic traits in
family or clan groupings, selection, occupation and social status differences, nutrition,
disease, war injuries, and immigration. (33)
Armelagos, G., A. Swediund, and J. Moore (Massachusetts), PALEOEPIDEMIOLOGICAL
ANALYSIS OF DISEASE IN PREHISTORIC POPULATIONS. Paleoepidemiology or the
study of ancient disease patterns in human populations can be an important source of both
demographic and archaeological interpretation when considered in the appropriate context.
This presentation uses paleopathological data as a demographic variable in the analysis of
material from the Dickson Mounds, Iilinois. (33)

WESTERN TEXAS. Results of a magnetometer survey at Hueco Tanks State Park (41EP2)
suggest a high correlation between magnetic anomalies and pit house structures and other .
areas of cultural activity at this site. Hueco Tanks is a late prehistoric site of the Jornada
Branch of the Mogolion near El Paso, Texas. Two techniques of magnetometer surveying
were employed. One consisted of a tightly controlled “in site’’ mode that produced a
magnetic contour map. The second method employed a “search mode" technique of a more
wide-ranging nature. Anomalies discovered by the proton magnetometer were tested by
excavation. (8) '
Asch, David (Northwestern), KOSTER SITE—THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. Members
of the Koster research project have collected and analyzed a variety of botanical, zoological,
and geomorphological data pertaining to prehistoric environments of the site. Some
preliminary reconstructions are presented in the paper, with assessments of the evidence for
stability and change. Interpretation requires recognition that, to varying extents, the
environmental indicators are affected both by tocally and regionally controlled variables. It
is necessary to take account of the consequences of human occupation for environments of
the site and surrounding areas, as well as man’s direct impact upon the archaeological
indicators. (38)
Athens, John Stephen, and Alan J. Osborn (New Mexico), RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL
INVESTIGATIONS AT SEVERAL CERAMIC SITES IN THE HIGHLANDS OF NORTH-
ERN ECUADOR. A smatil-scale program of archaeological survey and test excavations has
been initiated in order to investigate energy-capture and its sociocultural ramifications in
prehistoric cultural systems in the northern provinces of Pinchincha and Imbabura. The high
altitude site, La Chimba, is situated on the northern slopes of Mt. Cayambe. its rich midden
deposits contained an abundance of ceramics, faunal remains, lithic debitage, etc. A
radiocarbon date of ca, A.D. 753 was obtained from an occupational surface near the center
of the deposits. Additional test excavations in the intermontane valley near Otavalo have
recently been completed as well as several maps of large mound groups in various
environmental zones throughout the highlands. (30)
Autry, William O,., Jr. (North Carolina), POST FORMATIVE BURIAL PRACTICES IN THE
VALLEY OF OAXACA, MEXICO. Accepting the assumption that an individual’s treatment
at death is a reflection of his social persona in life, and that the social status system of a
society is reflected in the differences between interments, then social status systems of
extinct societies can be derived from archaeological burial data, This study presents the
results of an analysis of some 75 Post Formative burials from archaeological sites in the
Valley of Oaxaca. Two techniques of analysis are employed. First, the burials are examined
for regular trends in djsposal through examination of such attributes as sex, age, body
placement, and associated grave goods. The second method involves the use of a
computer-based typological program—Monothetic Subdivisive Classification in Archaeology
(Whallon 1971). Results of the 2 methods are compared and contrasted in order to outline
an hierarchy of status positions. (27)
Ayers, Harvard G. (Appalachian S), CULTURAL AND SOCIAL CHANGE DURING THE
SUSQUEHANNA TRADITION IN THE POTOMAC RIVER VALLEY. The social and
cultural correlates of several material culture changes in the Susquehanna Tradition (1000

vessel! manufacture. Means of introduction as well as implied behavioral changes are
discussed. (29)

starting in the Middie Prectassic times. Structural activity was prolific from the Late
Precilassic on, The present paper describes and discusses the architecture of the Late
Preclassic period and its relationship to that of the immediately sequential Early Classic
phases. (6)
Bartel, Brad (Missouri, Columbia), LOCATIONAL ANALYSIS OF THE ANATOLIAN
EARLY NEOLITHIC. Factor and tocational analysis has delineated a distinct grouping of
settlements spaced along 4 ecozones during the Anatolian Early Neolithic. A shape index
and nearest-neighbor analysis have shown sites to be uniformly spaced in a circle,
22
, approaching hexagonal fields of interaction with the large “town” of Catal Huyuk in the
center. To account for the highly efficient obsidian exploitation, a corridor configuration of
transport networks is hypothesized. Settlements show a pattern of socioeconomic alignment
to a “gateway town” (Catal Huyuk), and further to the area of resource (salt and obsidian).

OF TWO CASE STUDIES. A critical comparison is made between 2 recent case studies in
American archaeology, The Dynamics of Stylistic Change in Arikara Ceramics by Deetz, and
Archaeology as Anthropology by Longacre. The notion of experiment is introduced as a
standard of comparison that results in a lesson about archaeology as a science. (23)
Basa, Louise (Vermont), THE BOUCHER SITE (Vt-Fr-26): IMPLICATIONS FOR THE
STUDY OF EARLY WOODLAND MORTUARY PRACTICES IN VERMONT, The Boucher
site has yielded the most extensive, documented evidence of an Early Woodland cemetery
site in the Northeast. The pit graves contained both flexed bundle burials and cremations
deposited, in most cases, with some of the following attributes: red ochre, graphite, copper
beads, “blocked-end tubes,” ‘“‘Beaver-tail” ("Adena style") points, Marginella-shell beads,
and others. Many of the artifacts accompanying the burials were manufactured from raw
materials foreign to Vermont. Organic preservation at the site was relatively good with 62
features containing human skeletal material and/or artifacts. The Boucher site relates to 3
poorly reported sites in Vermont assigned by Ritchie to his Middlesex phase: the East Creek
site (Heye Foundation, 1934-36), the Swanton Burial Ground (published in 1873), and the
Bennett site (1942). This paper will present a summary of the Boucher site data, its
implications for a reassessment of the data from other similar sites in Vermont, and
hypotheses for the study of burial patterns within the Boucher site. (29)
Bebrich, Cari (Northwestern), KOSTER’S STRATIGRAPHY: THE METHODOLOGY OF
SITE STRUCTURE ANALYSIS. Using the Koster site as test case and example, the
methodology of stratigraphic analysis is critically examined in terms of the data
requirements of process-oriented archaeology. These Include the isolation of single
occupations and the delineation of associations and discontinuities ijn the distribution of
cultural and ecological items and features. Acquisition of these data is essential for the
understanding of settlement function and more broadly for formulating models of
man-environment interaction. To achieve these objectives stratigraphic analysis must entail
at least 5 basic tasks: (1) reconstruction of the physical stratigraphy in which archae-
ologically significant items and features are enmeshed; (2) stratigraphic isolation of single
occupations; (3) definition of associations and discontinuities in the distribution of items
and features within single occupations; (4) delineation of the activity structure of single
occupations; and (5) crosstabulation of excavation units within defined activity and
settlement components. The successful execution of these tasks will ensure a high level of
coherency between collateral lines of investigation (e.g., artifact analysis, botany, zoology,
etc.), while maximizing their number in studying those habitation units that hold the
greatest promise of solving basic research problems. (38)
Becker, Marshal Joseph (West Chester S), MOIETIES IN ANCIENT MESOAMERICA:
INFERENCES ON TEOTIHUACAN SOCIAL STRUCTURE DERIVED FROM THE
EVIDENCE OF MURAL PAINTINGS AND OTHER ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA. The
recently published interpretation of 2 Teotihuacan mural paintings and other related
evidence from Mesoamerica appear to provide direct archaeological evidence for the
existence of moieties among the Teotinuacanos. The carefully documented analysis of art
forms provided by Millon enables this archaeological problem to be studied through the
application of concepts of social structure. This process furthers our understanding of an
anthropological situation that can only be studied through the various techniques of
archaeology. (41)

Blackman, M. James (Section of Archaeology, State of Delaware), AN ANALYSIS OF
JASPER ARTIFACTS AND SOURCE MATERIALS BY ATOMIC ABSORPTION AND
FLAME PHOTOMETRY. Samples of Pennsylvania and Newark Jaspers have been collected
from outcroppings, from quarrying debris, and from workshop debris in the immediate
vicinity of the quarry sites. These samples, together with artifacts allegedly manufactured
from Pennsylvania or Newark Jasper and found in sites further south on the Delmarva

Blanton, Richard E. (Hunter), THE GREAT STYLES AND PRE-STATE TRADE IN THE
NEW WORLD. There is nothing exactly comparable, in an evolutionary sense, to the
regional exchange networks associated with the ‘‘Great Styles’ in the Old World centers
where pristine states evolved. The ‘‘Early Horizons” in both Mesoamerica and the Central
Andes were times when small, autonomous populations engaged in regional exchange
networks in which exchange involved, in part, the movement of valuable, high-status items
usually invested with symbols pertaining to a powerful supernatural system. This behavior
was largely absent in the Old World, | argue, in general, because of the importance there of
domesticated animals, which were used as exchangeable items rather than valuable,
sanctified goods. (41)

ISLANDS. Archaeological reconnaissance of the islands of St. Thomas and St. John coupled
with recently available data on the climate and soils of the islands make possible the

The factors apparent are (1) shelter from prevailing winds, and (2) the availability of Jaucas
(and perhaps Glynn) Series soils. Rainfall, and navigational and other factors seem to be
unimportant, This important first step in understanding the adaptation of such cultures to
the insular efvironment leads directly to interesting, archaeologically testable hypotheses.

Braun, Robert (itlinois, Urbana-Champaign), EXCAVATIONS AND SURFACE SURVEY
ALONG RIO CALLARIA, EASTERN PERU. A series of test cuts and surface collections in
1973 along the Rio Callaria, an eastern tributary of the Rio Ucayali, Departamento de
Loreto, Peru, has yielded several ceramic complexes comparable to the Pacacocha-
Cumancaya tradition described by Lathrap, Myers, and others. The sites in question are,
generally speaking, situated in a backwoods area. The virtuosity of artistic expression, the
control of execution, and the breadth of form categories, however, are quite unlike the
crude ceramics formerly hypothesized for early non-riverine Panoan-speaking groups. This,
along with evidence of sizeable and enduring occupations, suggests that the role of
“backwoods"’ groups in the development and spread of the Panoans has been unduly
minimized. A model emphasizing backwoods-to-riverine cultural and population inputs is
presented in order to reconcile these new archaeologic data with the ethnographic reality of
such groups as the Cashinahua and Remo. (30)

Chartkoff, Joseph L. (Michigan S), EXCHANGE, SEDENTISM, AND THE ORIGINS OF
AGRICULTURE IN THE NEAR EAST. Recent archaeological evidence for the Near East
suggests that exchange systems developed over wide areas prior to the adoption of
agricultural technology. In several cases evolving exchange systems became associated with
preagricultural sedentary settlements, increased population density, and increased social
stratification. This evidence demonstrates that the argument that agriculture is a
precondition to sedentism and social stratification in the Near East can be rejected. The
paper argues for a cybernetic understanding of the adaptive significance of exchange to a
population’s carrying capacity. it argues that the raised carrying capacity which exchange
brought to early post-glacial Near Eastern populations promoted and required increased
population density and increased sedentism, from which social stratification necessarily
developed. These conditions created a situation under which the promotion of agricultural
technology was highly advantageous if not requisite. It is finally argued that the same
processes appear to have been at work on the coast of Peru to lead to a “Neolithic” way of
life there, (41)

Collins, Alama Cordy (UCLA), THE POSSIBLE USE OF TEXTILES AS A CATECHISM
DURING THE EARLY HORIZON IN PERU. The Early Horizon in Peru was dominated by
2 cultural systems, Chavin in the north-central sierra and Paracas in the south coast. These 2
groups were separated from one another by a distance of ca. 350 miles. Ten years ago a
study of Paracas pottery conducted by Menzel, Rowe, and Dawson showed the intrusion of
specific Chavin traits. Since no pure Chavin material was known from the area at that time,
it could not be ascertained how or why the Chavin influence had been exerted. Three years
agoO a quantity of Chavin textiles were reported from the south coast. The author feels that
these textiles were the vehicle which brought the Chavin traits to the south coast area. This
paper presents an hypothesis to account for the presence of the textiles in an area far
| removed from the place of origin, and for the subsequent inclusion of the Chavin motifs in
| the Paracas pottery. (30)

Cotter, John L. (Natl Park Service), HOLISTIC CONSERVATION: PERSONAL INVOLVE-

matter of saving certain artifacts simply because they are threatened by destruction, or
because they are prehistoric and finite in number, or because they are already preserved as
landmarks. Conservation is rather concerned with a whole entity of sites, artifacts, and
data~prehistoric, ethnological, and historical—inciuding documentation and the living
memory. Hence, conservation must be truly holistic and is not limited to any one, ora
number, of its elements. With this concept in mind, this writer in 1971 made the proposal to
the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission as delegate from the Society for Ameri-
can Archaeology that an illustrated booklet be offered to students throughout the nation,
with focus upon the high school years, challenging them to recognize the whole gamut of
archaeological and historical resources and assume responsibility for conserving these assets.
in the booklet, Above Ground Archaeology, recently published and made available on a
nationwide basis to high school students, the reader is shown how, in lieu of digging
archaeological sites except when trained and expertly led, he can discover artifacts of
historical significance in home and community. He is shown how to identify inventory and
conserve such objects, together with other mem orabilia—photographic, written, and oral—so
that the evidence of the past may give perspective to the present and future, and introduce
him to the basic humanities. (The last a hopeful assist to university departments in a

Cowgill, George L. (Brandeis), ON POPULATION GROWTH AS A NON-EXPLANATION,
Population growth as an autonomous “prime mover” in cultural change is questioned.
Empirical data and quantitative considerations are cited to show that chronic difficulties in
controlling population growth cannot be assumed. Moreover, even when population
problems exist, it is drastically oversimple to suppose that they will generally be an effective
stimulus for developmental innovations. Development is more apt to be stimulated by more
effective economic demand, while stresses due to resource shortages may actually reduce
demand. Finally, overreliance on population growth as an autonomous variable encourages
neglect of other factors that are highly relevant for understanding developmental episodes.

refuse patterns was undertaken among the Bisa of the Luangwa Valley in Zambia. The Bisa
are subsistence cultivators, but due to the presence of the tsetse fly they keep no domesti-
cated animals other than chickens and pigeons. Consequently, they hunt wild game as their
major source of meat, leaving bone debris at various butchery and kill sites. During the
study the following research activities were conducted: (1) examination and recording of
bone scatters—accumulations of bone as a result of human, or carnivore, Kills or natural

indicate this cave was formed by frost fracturing (not solution) of limestone and concurrent
gravitational removal of resulting angular detritus. Portal blockage by a rising level of ex-
ternal Gebris caused internal material to accumulate and ultimately fil) the cavity. The oldest
hearth is dated at 11,580+250 years; the cave floor is not much older, Layers of Glacier
Peak and Mazama ash provide reliable time lines and delineate stages of the rising fill

northern Chile. Elements of the seriation include projectile point and boring tool attributes,
the latter being sensitive indicators of temporal change. Attributes rather than types were
used to avoid the inherent theoretical problems of typing and to maximize the information
potential of the collections. The sequence attempts micro-chronological control for the 70
components of the complex. This arder of precision is deemed necessary for studies of the
settlement and subsistence systems of hunter-gatherers. (30)

problems of adaptation. During the Early Intermediate period, the 3 state societies of
Moche, Lima, and Nazca dominated the coastal areas of Peru. Previous research has analyzed

these societies without reference to their interactions with contemporaneous, non-state

society that occupied peripheral valley sections; but it is felt that analysis of such inter-

intersocietal exchange between state and nan-state societies will be proposed and evaluated
for Lurin Valley populations. Specific models include: linear exchange, middiemen ex-

change, and peripheral markets. (15)

PATTERNS ON A TRANSECT FROM GLEN CANYON TO THE SALT RIVER VALLEY.

From 1970 to 1973, the Museum of Northern Arizona conducted site surveys and excava-

tions along a power line project having a 330-foot wide right-of-way, extending 256 miles

from Page to Phoenix, Arizona. This transect crosses the 4 major environmental zones in

Arizona—plateau, mountain, transition, and desert—and portions of 6 prehistoric culture

areas. A total of 88 sites was recorded, of which 24 were tested or excavated. Differential

patterning in settlement tocations, architecture, and functionally related artifact assemblages
is apparent between the culture areas. Temporal-spatial similarities between these variables
are also present. Among the important researches conducted during the project was the
investigation of a previously unknown archaeological area, Perry Mesa, in central Arizona.

Fitting, James E. (State Archacologist, Michigan History Div), ECONOMIC THEORY AND

LATE PERIOD TRADE IN THE UPPER GREAT LAKES REGION. There had been a long

history of inter-regional and inter-group trade in the Upper Great Lakes prior to the intro-

duction of European trade goods in the 17th century. It is most likely that the formal
mechanisms of trade in the late Prehistoric period were similar to those of the Early Historic
period and there may have been a continuation of existing trade relationships even with the
large scale dislocation of population which took place at that time. The generation of new
wealth, through the European trade, led to greater cultural distortion than took place during
the late Prehistoric period. Archaeological sites in the Mackinac region, both Late Prehistor-
ic and Early Historic, can be compared in terms of economic base, trade involvement,
surpluses, and surplus utilization to demonstrate the cultural distortion caused by an in-
crease in both real and conceived wealth. This model of 17th century culture change may be
applicable to the trade networks of the Late Archaic and Middle Woodland periods. The

European trade model does not differ significantly from those of the prehistoric period until

the 18th and early 19th centuries when the effects of the industrial revolution forced the

indigenous population into operating through European, rather than traditional, exchange
networks, (15)

Variability in unconsciously executed attributes is more likely to reflect the movement of

distinctive type known as cache blades, is an important activity. This activity is represented
by all stages of production from raw material to finished products. The production sequence
is discussed along with the nature and location of high-grade Onondaga Chert sources from .
which the materia! of cache blade manufacture is derived. Exploitation of these chert .
sources as an integral part of the Meadowood procurement system is analyzed. The dis-
covery of caches of large numbers of these blades in burial sites of the Meadowood phase is
then examined together with the distribution of these items in New York, Pennsylvania,
New England, and Canada, tt is suggested that cache blades were a major article in a trade
network operating along Late Archaic trade routes; that burial inclusions of these items may
represent disposal of surpluses from this trade cycle in ways that reinforce the social system |
and that export of Onondaga Chert, in the form of cache blades, was an example of the X
communication network that brought new ideas and goods into the central and western

treated as a product of indigenous population expansion, and, utilization of the tributaries
as a process of adjustment to changing features of the environment, both natural and

feedback. The model was first developed in conjunction with research into Hohokam cultur-
al development in the middie Santa Cruz Valley between 1968-1970. Since then some
preliminary tests of 2 different aspects of the model have produced both positive and
negative results, (42)

of the sequence, based on stratigraphic and stylistic evidence an argument is made that the
Qasawirka style represents the Early Intermediate period occupation in the area and that
this style persisted in time up until, and possibly after, the advent of Huari influence in

Although some Huari influence is evident toward the end, it appears that the Qasawirka

is inconclusive, some tentative speculations are warranted concerning the nature and impact

Participants in this interdisciplinary project are working with the broadly stated hypothesis
that environmental transition zones are characterized by increased diversity and variety of
plant and animal species and that in these situations human behavioral systems also have
increased diversity and variety. These areas of cultural diversity are usually characterized by
archaeologists as cultural boundaries. The study area is transitional between the Hohokam
and prehistoric Pueblo-like groups and between the low and high deserts of central Arizona.

Individual style variability in bifacial stone chipping could be helpful in delineating eco-

variability are isolated and a tentative model suggested to explain individual variability. Scar
pattern orientation is tested for ability to discriminate between modern stone knappers.
Laser diffraction is used to convert the scar patterns into numerical data. Principal com-
ponents and discriminant function models are developed and tested for applicability. The
résults indicate that scar patterns can contribute to the identification of individual knappers.

2 cultural systems are in direct competition for land characterized by ecological diversity,
that system possessing the less specialized exploitative strategy will be best equipped to
utilize the resources of that ecological zone; (2) an early northern movement represents the
expansion of a specialized economic system based on irrigation agriculture; and (3) the later
southern and western movement into the area are representative of a diverse exploitative
system that provided greater numbers of options for mitigating the effects of environmental
fluctuations on subsistence. (37)

Healy, Paul F. (Harvard), THE CUYAMEL CAVES: PRECLASSIC SITES IN NORTHEAST
HONDURAS. The southern border of Mesoamerica is traditionally drawn at the Ulua River
of western Honduras before dipping southward to northwest Costa Rica. Recent work in the
Department of Colon, northeast Honduras, provides the earliest evidence of aboriginal occu-
pation in the region and extends the established chronological sequence back 1000 years or
more. An examination of the ceramics, and a comparison to other Preclassic sites indicates
that eastern Honduras, despite its later affiliation with Lower Central American cultural
patterns, was probably participating in the cultural developments and long-distance trade
network of Formative period (ca. 1000 B.C.) of Mesoamerica. !t is suggested that the
cultural frontier of Mesoamerica in the southeast be extended eastward for the Preclassic
time horizon. (6)

Hellmuth, Nicholas M., PETEN YTZA MAYA AGRICULTURE AND DEMOGRAPHY,
A.D. 1667. Previously unpublished manuscripts in the Archivo General de Indias, Spain,
provide fascinating detail about the subsistence of the 17th century Peten Maya. Zapote and
cacao and other tree crops (but no ramon), potatoes and other root crops, maize, and a
dozen tesser plant foods coupled with fish, shellfish, wild deer, and wild and domestic
turkeys, provided a relatively balanced diet. Also, the Spanish friars mention the population
figures for houses and villages. Other vivid descriptions of the land and its resources allow a
reconstruction of political geography and land use. More than 4000 pages of manuscripts
have been culled for the information to be reported in this presentation. This ethnohistoric
al information will contribute to our understanding of the Classic Maya of the same central
Peten region. (27)
Hemmings, E. Thomas (Florida State Mus), CADES POND SUBSISTENCE, SETTLEMENT,

central Florida was defined by Goggin 25 years ago, It was seen as a dim reflection of more
complex cultures of the St. Johns Valley (St. Johns 1B) and Gulf Coast (Weeden Island !) by
Goggin and his successors, Subsequent excavations and analyses by the Florida State Muse-
um and the University of Florida, expecially those at the Melton Village Site and Melton
Mounds near Gainesville, provide excellent initial data for Cades Pond subsistence, settic-
ment, and ceremonialism. The extent to which Cades Pond peoples were stimulated by or
shared in economic and ceremonial aspects of the St. Johns and Weeden Island traditions
remains to be shown. Tabulating ceramic type frequencies contributes little to the solution
of this problem. In the light of new evidence, Cades Pond is a significant developmental
stage in the Formative sequence of central Florida. (34)

LOGICAL RESEARCH. Recent archaeological investigations carried out with the use of
aerial imagery by the Chaco Center, National Park Service, suggest some facets of the utility
of remote sensing techniques in archaeological survey. The case in point is an ongoing survey
of prehistoric facilitative systems at Chaco Canyon, New Mexico; this effort has included an
examination on a regional scale of roadway systems, irrigation, and architecture associated
with the Anasazi fluorescence of A.D. 1000-1150. It can be argued that the frame appropri-
ate to many productive archaeological questions is the region; large areas and complex
relationships can only be approached, however, through the employment of a stringently
followed research design, data-to-problem feedback, and a sampling regime specific to
questions asked. Remote sensing techniques, including the use of various types of imagery,
microtopographic mapping, and electronic image manipulation, cannot only be of use to
archaeologists in such pursuits, but can result in increased economies over tedious tradition-
al methods as well. (8)

ceramic typologies used in archaeology are based on stylistic attributes and hence models of
prehistoric cultural dynamics are based on underlying assumptions about the behavior of
aesthetic value systems. In this paper, it is demonstrated that there are limitations placed on
ceramic vessels due to physical properties of low-fire clay bodies and inherent forms that
containers must assume in order to function. Based on such attributes as porosity, shape,
and volume, a taxonomy is created which implies certain functions of some ceramic vessels
from the White River Lowlands, Arkansas. By utilizing a functional taxonomy, ceramic
assemblages may be constructed that, when controlled by standard stylistic taxonomy,
allows models to be postulated as to variations in family size and structure as well as reveal
changes in the economic systems. (26)

strength of thermoluminescence lies in its objectivity and in the quantifiable nature of its
results, Tests have revealed a definite differentiation in electronic charge between cherts
heated in a muffle furnace and those not so treated. Similar tests indicate that the same
differentiation exists in cherts from archaeological contexts and does not always correspond
to such subjective factors as color and juster. (26)

, Judge, W. James (New Mexico), AN EVALUATION OF THE OVERKILL MODEL. Martin
(1973) has recently restated his basic Pleistocene overkill hypothesis in more positive terms.
He now suggests the New World megafaunal extinction to be a function of an “advancing
front” of high density wave of Paleo-Indian big-game hunters moving quite rapidly from
north to south in a relatively short period of time. His basic model is drawn from analogy
with the colonization of an area by an exotic species. For Martin's hypothesis to be sup-
ported, it is essential to secure evidence of the systematic predation of a variety of extinct
megafauna by Paleo-Indian hunters of the Clovis period. A review of the existing Paleo-
(Indian data from the Plains and Southwest, reported herein, indicates that such evidence is
not yet available. Evidence does suggest that a specialized subsistence adaptation. focusing
on the exploitation of one species (bison) in the low-diversity Plains grassland environments
was not obtained until Folsom times. Rather than that of specialized predation the Clovis
adaptation may be more appropriately viewed as transitional from a broad-spectrum general-
ized subsistence strategy on the part of early pre-Clovis occupants of North America, to the
specialized focal economies of the post-Clovis Paleo-indian period. This view is more in line
with the evidence available at this time, and does not support the overkill hypothesis. (28)

Individual use is posited from this disparity in scraper morphology and edge wear and from

tool morphology allowed for successful completion of a series of scraping tasks. As such,
edge wear is variable, depending upon the task, and individual responses or preferences in

Linares, Olga (Smithsonian Tropical Research Inst), ON THE ABSENCE OF ANIMAL
DOMESTICATION IN THE NEW WORLD TROPICS: A SYSTEMS APPROACH. In spite
of the natural occurrence of gregarious and potentially domesticable mammalian species
such as deer and 2 kinds of peccary, plus the more solitary caviomorph rodents (agouti and
Paca) and even tapir, tropical forest people apparently never attempted to raise animals
systematically for food. A presumed abundance of wild species cannot be an explanation;
within a single species, tropical animal populations are relatively small and widely fluc-
tuating, accounting in part for the frequent move of hunting peoples in search of game.
Neither were fish and shelifish protein resources entirely adequate by themselves, to judge
from the presence of numerous mammal bones in most tropical riverine and \ittoral sites.
Explanations must be sought on the conditions that restricted other parts of the subsistence
system of tropical forest groups. The difficulty of intensifying agricultural production in
order to feed captive animals, and the demands of nomadic slash and burn agriculture must
have been important factors. |n addition, natural selection in the tropics had worked against
human setection pressures by favoring few births, long life and crypticness in wild mam-
malian populations. (36)

a pre-investigation formulation of problem-oriented research designs. Two examples of this
posture toward contract work are reconnaissance level surveys conducted for selection
procedures of alternative power line corridors. Location analysis of sites in extensive sys-
tems of corridors was attempted based on an environmentally stratified sampling design and
predictive projections of site density. Other research has centered around inserting after the
fact research problems into ongoing or rush contract projects initiated without previous
research design. Experiments with this procedure on highway salvage projects indicate that

Marsh, Amanda (UCR), THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE EASTERN MOJAVE DESERT.
Site types and distributions in the Eastern portion of the Mojave Desert reflect adaptations
to drier, more mountainous environments than in the western portion. The lack of detailed
_ environmental data does not permit detailed correlation between climatic change and varia-
tions in site distribution through time, although the ethnographic record suggests that
adaptation rather than migration was the normal response to changing environmental con-
ditions in the desert. (35)

plicable by first using multivariate analysis (multi-dimensional scaling) to find the en-

kinds of sites, While not all dimensions were interpretable, the majority were and clear
changes through time are shown; the environmental constraints shown in the hypervolume

found using the hypervolume approach, (22)
McBride, Harold W., MIDDLE FORMATIVE CERAMICS FROM THE CUAUHTITLAN
REGION, VALLEY OF MEXICO. A nucleated village site of 300 to 600 persons existed on
a low ridge overlooking the Rio Cuauhtitian throughout the Middle and Late Formative.
The ceramics are very similar to other Valley sites such as Zacatenco and Middie Formative
Tlatilco and Tlapacoya. The early La Pastora phase is identified by a thick black ware with
geometric incisions and curvilinear excisions and by a distinctive White-on-Red ware and
Red-on-White ware. The figurines for this phase include type C3, C5, C9, B-C, and B. The
later Cuautepec phase is identified by a thin black-brown ware with cursive incisions and by
distinctive Red-on-White and Red-on-Buff wares. The figurine style for this phase may be
limited to type A. The Cuautepec phase was succeeded by the distinctly new ceramic
complex of Ticoman | and || which shows many points of similarity with the figurines and
ceramics of the state of Puebla. (27)

Avifauna from Antelope House consists mainly of Large Indian Domestic Turkeys, some of
which were apparently eaten, but most of which were raised for their feathers as indicated
by the presence of 3 aberrant colorations—erythristic, silver phase, and pied—that occur in
unusual numbers, Although a predominance of turkeys is reminiscent of the San Juan area,
and the use of Scarlet Macaw feathers is also found in the Kayenta area, Antelope House
avifauna is an independent and important center of domestic turkey deyelopment. (1, 2)

the Museum of Northern Arizona conducted an archaeological survey and excavations along
the 170-mile tong Los Angeles Department of Water and Power power line right-of-way
across northern Arizona and southern Utah. A total of 61 sites were recorded, of which 32
were excavated. Seventeen of the excavated sites have ceramic components identified with
44
, the Virgin and Kayenta Anasazi and Southern Paiute traditions. The remaining sites are
lithic scatters, mostly lacking culturally diagnostic artifacts. Detailed analysis of the chipped
stone tool industries of both the ceramic and non-ceramic sites has been directed toward a
description of attributes sufficient for cultural identification of the lithic sites. A study of
the differing resource utilization patterns of each identified cultural group was then
conducted, based on functional analysis of the lithic tools plus habitat analysis of the sites.

Meyers, Thomas (Michigan), THE NEED FOR STANDARDIZATION OF RESULTS IN
ARCHAEOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY. A noteworthy failure of many published chemical
analyses of archaeological specimens is that no standardized results are reported which
would allow independent comparisons to be made of materials described in different
studies. In dealing with this problem, the University of Michigan Museum of Anthropology
has analyzed over 6500 archaeological and geological specimens in studies of traded cherts
and obsidians. Since 1970, a great deal of effort has been spent in standardizing our
procedures and results. For this we have used the U.S.G.S. rock standards W-1 and BCR-1
and the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory pottery standard. From our experience, we make
several proposals concerning the comparative use of standard materials in chemical analyses
of artifacts, and concerning the determination and reporting of experimental error. Without
adoption of these or similar approaches to standardization, future comparisons of analytic
results obtained by archaeological chemists wil be meaningless. (39)

remains are dependent upon man for their survival and development and may therefore be

select seed corn according to rigid criteria, segregate varieties by field, and maintain selected
varieties as the exclusive property of a household. Careful study of the cultivated plant
remains from one site enables comparison to other collections from neighboring sites. It is
also possible to study the amount and nature of temporal and spatial variation within the

ISLAND CULTURES: AN OVERVIEW. Research carried out in the Southeast since
Gordon R. Willey’s pioneering work on the Florida Gulf coast in the 1930s has shown that
the term Weeden Island is applicable to several geographically distinct yet temporally
equivalent cultures. These cultures, located in the coastal plain east of the Alabama River
and west of the Altamaha River and from the fall line south into north peninsular Florida,
participated in a similar ceremonial life while maintaining different adaptations (or
adjustments) to their respective environments. These adjustments evidently supported
similar levels of subsistence, though not types of subsistence, at least as far as this can be
inferred from ceremonialism. The growth of Weeden Island-ism is examined and placed in
the context of Southeast prehistory and cultural processes. Also, suggestions are made for
future research on Weeden Island-ism and Weeden Island cultures. (34)

as traditionally practiced in eastern North America, have proceeded essentially oblivious to
potential skewing resulting from inadequate sample sizes. The estimation of minimum
number of individuals (and resulting meat weight equivalents) from smal! samples
compound such errors, and certain procedures of analysis almost insure inadequate samples
of most species encountered in archaeological contexts. The question of what constitutes an
adequate sample for remains of various classes of animals is explored and various alternatives
of analysis aré suggested in those instances where samples aré inadequate. Another
potentially very serious source of error in any attempt to reconstruct prehistoric subsistence
patterns is differential destruction of various classes of faunal remains. Although there is a
général awareness that this problem exists, we have not yet come to grips with what it might
represent quantitatively. Here also certain ‘‘correction factors" are suggested. (40)

Steed-Kisker. Through an attributal analysis based on the presence and absence of specific
designs and design elements plus a quantitative analysis of Steed-Kisker and Nebraska
sherds, these theories are tested. Data from over 10 sites, and especially from the Young
(23PL4) and Coons (23PL16) sites, are used to develop a refined stylistic chronology. The
data are then integrated into the ceramic sequence from Powell Tract particularly period | V.
The stylistic evolution of the ceramics developed suggests northern Steed-Kisker sites are
later in time than the southern ones that are stylistically earlier. That data, pilus statistical
information on Nebraska pottery types in northern Steed-Kisker sites would seem to
support the suggestion by Calabrese that Nebraska culture develops out of Steed-Kisker.

accepted by most archaeologists, that determinations of animal bones must be positive ones
to be of any real interpretive value. Identifications that are ‘‘guessed”’ at or that are listed as
positive, when in fact they are not, result in more confusion to the site analyst than if there
were listed only in the broad sense. Many times overconfidence in the identifier as to his

taxonomic problems, of importance to the archaeologist, are discussed. (20)

and the strength of the contact between the Ohio Valley and the source regions for raw
materials. Ethnographic models are applied to determine possible mechanisms for trade and
communication. The paper considers the development of part-time and possibly full-time
craft specialists, and the distribution of the finished products. Data from various sites will be
analyzed to determine if they could have been distribution centers for specific materials or
finished products. The “‘decline™ of Hopewell as it relates to trading patterns will be the

that the site was occupied during Nasca 7, 8, and 9. Pottery of the Nasca8 occupation can
be subdivided into 3 successive sub-phases of chronological significance on both stylistic and
stratigraphic grounds. This allows us to date the initial construction of a round structure at
the site, and to trace the sequence of its later additions. It is proposed that this round
structure and a similar and contemporary building at Tres Palos Il, some distance away,
were both involved with ceremonial activities that may prefigure the ceremonial complex
found at Pacheco during Nasca39. (16)

coastal peoples to the north and to the south, and between the Northwest Coast and the

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE SINAGUA CULTURE: A REEVALUATION. Site density
increases in the Flagstaff region after the eruption of Sunset Crater in about &4.D. 1066 have
traditionally been used to infer population increases, colonial movements, and resultant
changes in the Sinagua culture. Recent work in the area and a reexamination of the original
data suggests an alternate hypothesis better explains the post-eruptive site density increases,
Although domestic functions can be attributed to most post-eruptive pit houses and
pueblos, the majority of post-eruptive sites are small masonry structures, probably used as
field houses. These functional identifications are supported by proportional differences in
the occurrence of functionally related artifact assemblages between the 2 classes of sites,
suggesting that the small sites are agriculturally related. It is conciuded that post-eruptive
site density increases result from a change in agricultural practices and not from mass
migrations of people from different cultural areas or from radical population increases. (42)

of Variance, Nearest Neighbor !ndex) and measures of the degree of clustering between 2 or
more artifact types (Index of Segregation, correlation, cluster overlap) are discussed and
compared. Methods for the definition of artifact clusters on ground plans are suggested and
demonstrated using a series of ground plans from Mesolithic sites in the Netherlands.
Finally, the definition and utility of the concepts of tool kits and activity areas are
considered. (25)
Proulx, Donald A. (Massachusetts, Amherst), THE EARLY INTERMEDIATE PERIOD ON
THE SOUTHERN NORTH COAST OF PERU, A recent survey of the Nepena Valley on the
north coast of Peru has provided valuable information on the interrelationships of the
Gallinazo, Recuay and Moche traditions in this region, The Gallinazo style, which is known
from the Chicama, Viru, and Santa Valleys, has now been discovered in Nepena, making
that valley the southernmost limit of the style. Recuay, originating in the highlands, spread
to Santa and Nepena, but not to the Casma Valley. During the latfer part of the Early
Intermediate period, the Moche tradition was introduced into the Santa and Nepena Valleys
50
, from the north, with Nepena again forming the southern boundary of this style. The nature
and interrelationships of these traditions on the southern north coast is examined in this
paper. (15)

analyze painted ceramics from prehistoric pueblos in west-central New Mexico are discussed.
A system of analysis has been devised to record a diverse set of attributes in the 4 major
categories of artifact variation: technological-functional, design configuration, design
elements, and metrical. The observed variation and covariation in attributes is then
associated with cultura! variables derived from other data. Because of the ultimate
uncertainty of whether or not a specific individual is responsible for a series of artifacts, it is
proposed that a more useful approach is to use a continuum of hypothetical hierarchical
groups of varying size based on the relative intensity of interaction between members of the
group. This hierarchical set of groups and associated measures of interaction serve as the
basic analytical units for testing hypotheses. (17)

explaining the behavior of aboriginal social units as evidenced in the archaeological record.
A series of research projects have derived techniques for the recovery of parameters of Bison

recover parameters of human group size and composition. Multivariate statistical techniques

parameters with a record of climatic fluctuation. (42)

Robertson, Robin (Harvard), THE DETECTION OF FOOD PREPARATION PRACTICES
FROM FAUNAL REMAINS. Faunal remains have tong been regarded as a source of
information on the cultural practices of prehistoric peoples. One aspect of such information
is the determination of the food preparation techniques practiced at a given site. If this
problem has been considered at all, traditionally such materials as vessels, ceramic or
otherwise, heat-cracked rocks, artistic representations, historical records, or the imagination
of the archaeologist have been employed. At the present, no means of determining such
practices from the bones themselves exists. With this goal in mind, a series of experiments
were designed to derive the desired information from the bones. This paper will first
examine the technique utilized and the resulting conclusions. Secondly the technique will
be applied to a collection of bones recovered from the site of Dun Ajlinne, C. Kildare,

the possibilities of change over time and/or differential preparation of meat according to the

Rouse, Irving (Yale), CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT ON ANTIGUA, WEST INDIES.
Excavations last summer at the site of !ndian Creek on Antigua have revealed a sequence of
3 ceramic complexes, Indian Creek, Mill Reef, and Marmora Bay. The first 2 are Saladoid,
and appear to be ancestral to the Ostionoid, Meijilacoid, and Chicoid series of complexes of
the Greater Antilles. The third is a local development, related to the Elenoid complexes in
the other Leeward Islands, the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The 3 indicate a continuous,
uninterrupted occupation of Antigua from ca. A.D. 1 to A.D. 1200, contrary to the theories
of migration of post-Saladoid peoples through the island during the tatter part of this
period. Further excavation was undertaken in January 1974 at the site of Freeman's Bay in
an effort to obtain traces of a subsequent Carib occupation of the island. A separate
Freeman’s Bay complex was encountered, but it seems to have developed out of the eartier
complexes. None of the remains so far found can be attributed to the Carib. (41)

“processual,”” and “ecological archaeology," and many other seemingly disparate programs
compete for the attention of modern researchers. Can all of these divergent trends be viewed
in a framework broad enough to encompass their diversity while maintaining their integrity?
This paper attempts to define the stable continuities of a behavioral archaeology,
encompassing the divergent trends of current research. This integration is achieved through a
consideration of the flow of general and specific types of information among the 4
interrelated strategies of a behavioral archaeology. The strategy concerned with answering
specific questions about the past requires additional efforts at reintegration. We propose a
framework, based on the distinction between the archaeological and systemic contexts and
the formation processes of the archaeological record, to achieve this reintegration, (21)
Schiffer, Michael B. (Arkansas Archeological Survey), CULTURAL FORMATION
PROCESSES OF “OCCUPATION FLOORS.” Recent attempts at behavioral inference,
especially on Paleolithic materials, utilize the concept of “‘occupation” or “living floor." It
is argued here that this concept and the analytic techniques often coupled to it must be
54
, replaced by others more sensitive to the complex behavioral determinants of spatial patterns
in archaeological sites. Attention is focused on the source of behavioral variability most
frequently overlooked in activity reconstructions, the cultural formation processes of the
archaeological record. The quantitative, spatial, and formal transformations created between
the systemic and archaeological contexts of materials by cultural formation processes must
be explicitly modeled in the course of any serious analysis. By modeling these processes, the
spatial patterning of artifacts is more rigorously explained, and the credibility of behavioral
reconstructions is significantly enhanced. These arguments and concepts are illustrated with ;
selected materials from the New World. (25)

years of focus on the Woodiand period (500 B.C. to A.D. 900) in the tower Illinois and
adjacent Mississippi Valley region, the Northwestern University archaeological program
elected to begin an intensive study of the antecedent Archaic cultures in the same area. In
1969, the Koster site was selected to begin this study. Koster is located along the eastern

56
, bluffline of the Illinois Valley trench, 50 miles north of St. Louis. Five seasons of
excavation yield evidence of 15, and perhaps 16, superimposed cultural strata, each
separated from those over- and underlying it by inter-horizons of sterile siopewash soils. The
numerous occupations, the long time span represented, a uniformly high level of bone and
plant remains preservation, and the almost complete separation of cultural strata by sterile
beds, together make Koster an unusual opportunity to obtain a cross-section of information
on Archaic adaptations in the central Mississippi River drainage. The Koster data greatly
amplifies the information on Archaic subsistence-settlement systems available from this
area. Koster provides an opportunity to refine and extend the existing cultural chronology ‘
for the Archaic of this area. Finally, Koster is seen as a proving ground for new approaches
to interdisciplinary research on complex habitation sites, The concept of the “archaeological
research community” as an operating social and academic unit has emerged from this
attempt to develop viable interdisciplinary research at Koster. (38)

Tartaglia, Louis J. (UCLA), HEADLESS BURIALS: A SPECIALIZED MORTUARY
PRACTICE AT GUATACONDO, CHILE. An investigation was undertaken to determine the
mortuary custom practiced at Guatacondo, Chile, which has been radiocarbon dated at the
beginning of the Christian era. Subsequent examination of this burial complex revealed a
distinct cultural anomaly present, headless burials. The archaeological evidence seems to
suggest that a ceremonial-religious activity, in contrast to trophy headhunting, is associated
with this specialized burial custom. (30) k

THEORETICAL LINKING ARGUMENTS AND THEIR ROLE IN THE CONSTRUCTION
OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH DESIGNS. Theoretical linking arguments are those
arguments employed by the archaeologist to attribute meaning to the archaeological record,
Archaeological research designs are the means of operationalizing these arguments and
therefore provide a useful context in which to examine their role in the development of
archaeological and anthropological theory. Research designs of the ‘‘new" archaeology will
be examined as to the nature of their theoretical linking arguments and contrasted with
those of the old archaeology. (21)

Thatcher, John P. (Wright S), A VIEW OF THE NORTH HIGHLANDS AS SEEN FROM
HUAMACHUCO. The geographical location of the Huamachuco region, midway between
the Cajamarca Basin to the north and the Callejon de Huaylas to the south, makes it a
potentially important area for the study of culture process in the North Highiands. Recent
archaeological data indicate that there may have been a close relationship between
Huamachuco and the Cajamarca Basin. Also, settlement pattern data indicate a period of
nucleation in Huamachuco during the tatter half of the Early Intermediate period. This
Paper summarizes the evidence for these statements and proposes a number of questions
that are raised thereby. (15) |

Thomas, Ronaid A. (Section of Archaeology, State of Delaware), EFFECTS OF TRADE
ON ABORIGINAL CULTURAL MANIFESTATIONS OF THE DELMARVA PENINSULA.
The existence of an extensive trade and communications network functioning in much of
the eastern United States during the last 3000 years is well documented archaeologically.
The recovery of exotic artifacts throughout the Delmarva Peninsula has made it obvious that
the network reached the Middie Atlantic seaboard. While the extent and duration of this
network is relatively well known, the mechanisms by which it operated have attracted little
investigation. Coeval with the appearance of this exchange system in the Delmarva Peninsula
57
, is the advent of a highly developed socioreligious complex. This complex is recognized by
patterned and differential treatment of corpses during mortuary rites and by the utilization
of the exotic artifacts acquired through the trade network as emblems of office and as
means of denoting particular status levels. it is contended that this socioreligious complex
could not, and did not, exist in aboriginal cultures of the Delmarva Peninsula prior to the
appearance of the exchange network. Although a cause and effect relationship between
trade possibilities and developed status systems is not suggested, it should be pointed out
| that little change occurred during the initial period being considered in any but the 2
aforementioned areas, The subsistence-settlement system, for instance, remained relatively
stable during the first 2000 years of the existence of the trade and communications
network. (19)
Thompson, Jeannette Jackson (Missouri), ACTIVATION ANALYSIS AT THE U.M.c.
LABORATORY FOR NUCLEAR ARCHAEOLOGY: I. CERAMICS AND METALS.
Neutron activation has proved to be a powerful tool in determining the provenience of
artifacts. Work is in progress at this laboratory on the analysis of ceramics from North
America, Europe, and Africa, and metal objects from Europe and Africa. Problems involved
in these analyses include: preparation of a chemical standard for short-lived radioisotopes,
reduction of sample contamination, Uniformity of sample preparation, irradiation and
counting parameters, reliability of isotopic determinations, and interpretation of data.
Results allow the differentiation of prehistoric raw material sources through time and space.

Topic, Theresa L. (Harvard), CONTINUITY AND GROWTH AT MOCHE, A series of deep
strata cuts at the site of Moche in the Moche Valley have shown that the site was occupied
continuously from Late Gallinazo through Moche IV. Although the stratigraphy is
complicated by depositional problems, the growth of the site can be traced in terms of area
covered, density of occupation, and increasing architectural complexity and variety. Growth ;
in these spheres corretates with increasing power and influence of the site relative to other
settlements in the Moche Valley and in adjoining valleys. The evidence indicates that the
growth of the site and its influence was a gradual, cumulative process. Since it is during this
time period that the antecendents to Late Intermediate period urbanism appear, the nature .
of gradual independent culture change must be examined, For a variety of reasons it is
especially difficult to isolate the factors responsible for this kind of change, but the long
occupation and deep stratigraphy at Moche make it possible to recognize the process, if not
to explain it satisfactorily. (15)
Trubowitz, Neal (SUNY, Buffalo), RESEARCH ORIENTATIONS IN SALVAGE ARCHAE-

impractical due to biased samples or lack of sufficient data. An example of a highway salvage
program that incorporates research goals and methodology is discussed. (31) :
Ubelaker, oe H.-(Smithsonian), ANTHROPOLOGICAL INTERPRETATIONS FROM
DEMOGR iC RECONSTRUCTION: A CASE STUDY FROM THE TIDEWATER
POTOMAC, Demographic data reconstructed from skeletal samples can be used to examine
problems in archaeology and ethnohistory. In this study, demographic profiles were
reconstructed from protohistoric ossuary samples in the mid-Atlantic area of the United
States. The resulting mortality curves, survivorship curves, life tables, and crude mortality
rates were then used together with archaeological information to estimate the number of
years represented by the ossuary, the size of the formerly living population, and the nature
of the social-political unit contributing to the ossuaries. These estimates were then
compared with others derived from different types of data. (33)
Vanderieest, Barbara (Wisconsin, Milwaukee), AN ANALYSIS OF MOUND 72 POTTERY.
Mound 72 of the Cahokia site in East St. Louis, Illinois has attracted attention for its
elaborate burials and cache pits. This paper presents the results of an analysis of the ceramic
remains from Mound 72. The pottery, coded into the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee
Ceramic Code, was examined statistically both as a single component and for internal
variation. A comparison of ceramics found in the Mound 72 midden areas with those found
associated with the elaborate burial caches lends itself to sociocultural interpretation. Trade
connections, possibly with the Caddoan area, are also in evidence. (11)
Veltre, Douglas W. (Connecticut), THE USE OF HISTORIC AND ETHNOGRAPHIC DATA
IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION. The use of historic and ethnographic
materials in the archaeological investigation of sites of the historic period has a significant
potential for both archaeological method and theory. Such materials have too long been
employed simply to provide more detail to reconstructions of culture history. |nstead, it is
suggested that historic and ethnographic data can be instrumental adjuncts to a processual
58
, archaeological investigation, both by providing expanded data base upon which hypotheses
may be formulated and also by providing data against which archaeological hypotheses,
tested archaeologically, can further be examined, thereby providing the discipline with a
means for critically testing some of its notions concerning the nature of archaeological
proof. (21)

FOR ISOLATING AND RECOGNIZING OVERLAPPING SPATIAL DISTRIBUTIONS.
The purpose of this paper is to present a spatial analysis method for isolating and
recognizing overlapping activity areas in the archaeological record. A factor analysis model ts
employed in which the cases represent subdivided spatial units of an occupational level and
the variables are the artifacts found within each spatial unit. A rank-ordering of factor scores
reveals the spatial dimensions of each activity area. A strategy for choosing a beginning
reference point, as well as for determining the size of the spatial unit, is suggested. (25)

between environmental! conditions and bone decay. First we shall review some factors that
affect the rate of bone decomposition such as temperature, water movement, and soil pH.
We will then discuss the results of our research On bone size as it affects bone degradation,
In simulation studies we found that protein is lost more quickly from small particles than
from large particles of cow bone. This finding ts important in interpreting the results of
attempts to date archaeological bone specimens and is a significant factor to consider in the
interpretation of faunal remains at archaeological sites. (20)

OF ICONOGRAPHY. This paper focuses on the evolution in form and meaning of the
Masked Mythical Being motif in Nazca iconography. !n order to interpret this evolution
several other motifs are also considered, including the Killer Whale, Warrior and Cosmic
Deity, which lead to a re-examination of Roark's distinction between mythical and military
themes. On the basis of this discussion the paper explores the extent to which an artistic
tradition can be treated as a reflection of the culture within which it was produced, with an
emphasis on art as a semi-independent tradition within a culture rather than as a reflection
of a cultural whole, (16)

MID-SOUTH. The Middie Woodland tradition in the highland Mid-South is differentiated
from earlier regional expressions by the emergence of a new cultural pattern. This
development was, in part, stimulated by the participation of certain ethnic groups in a series |
of local and extra-areal transaction systems, previously defined as the ‘‘Hopewellian Sphere
of Interaction." The contemporary communities in the Mid-South that participated in this
exchange network are delineated and the effects of this phenomenon on their cultural

of goods between these groups are offered, as well as the role played by highland raw
materials and commodities in the initiation of this cultural interaction. (5)

relevant to crucial points of archaeological theory, while others obviously reflect merely a

disagreement from what is merely superficial polemical rhetoric. In this paper such a review
is offered, together with a discussion of the main points at issue. (21)

Weiss, Kenneth M. (Texas, Houston), THE USE OF LIFE TABLES FOR DEMOGRAPHIC
INFERENCE FROM SKELETAL POPULATIONS. tn this study, population remains are
simulated first by deterministic population projection procedures using a Known model life
table. The effect of various growth rates, and of initial deviations from stability, are tested
for their degree of distortion of demographic inferences made from the remains. Secondly, a
series of sporadic demographic disturbances are tested for their effect on the simulated
remains. It is found that even for severe disturbances, only a fairly short recovery period of
continued deposition must follow before the life table can again be inferred with fair
accuracy. The different effects of mortality and fertility “‘events”’ are examined, as well as
the speed of recovery from density-dependent populations. tn general, it can be concluded
that under some mild restrictions, and for populations of long deposition history, model tife "
tables can safely be used to determine reasonably approximate life tables. The importance
of using settlement-pattern analysis to determine population growth and other demographic
information is highlighted by this investigation as well. (33)
Wenke, Robert (Michigan), APPLICATION OF LOCATIONAL MODELS TO THE
EVOLUTION OF IMPERIAL SYSTEMS IN SOUTHWESTERN IRAN. The question of why
geographically and temporally distinct cultural systems should go through apparently similar
patterns of socioeconomic expansion has long been of interest to researchers. This paper
attempts to test empirically some of these workers’ and the author’s own ideas about such
Parallels, using a predictive model based on mathematical models developed in locational
geography. The Susiana Plain in southwestern Iran was selected as the ideal area for these
testing procedures because it was the agricultural heartland and frequently the imperial
capital to 2 important ancient empires, the Parthian (250 B.C.-A.D. 250) and the Sassanian
(A.0. 250-A.D. 650). (4)
Whallon, Robert, Jr. (Michigan), TOOL KITS OR ACTIVITY AREAS? The most common
approach to the analysis of patterns of artifact distribution on an occupation floor has been
to define clusters for each individual type in turn, to define “tool kits" from patterns of
mutual spatial covariation among artifact types, and finally to use the Spatial clustering of
these tool kits to find “‘activity areas” on the occupation floor. This approach has been
successful in some cases but not in many others. In this paper we explore the possibility that
Our conception of a “too! kit” is not particularly realistic and that the above approach
might be reversed, searching first for “activity areas'’ and only consequently attempting to
define “tool kits.” (25)

Winter, Joseph C. (Utah), THE SPREAD OF AGRICULTURE IN THE SOUTHWEST AND

emphasized the diffusion of new crops and morphological changes in the local maize series
as the major factors in the adoption of a farming economy. While the present study accepts
the importance of species and varietal alterations, it concentrates upon modifications of the
regional systems of exploitation in explaining agricultural adoption, and in particular
examines the local wild plant collecting complexes and their environmental relations, Data
based upon corpolite, pollen, and macrofloral sequences from 2 Utah cavés are presented
which correlate the local adoption of farming with the development of grass collecting
complexes, perhaps in a context of broadened grasslands and expanding farmiands.
Additional factors that are considered include maize evolution, population dynamics, and
preadaptations to prior subsistence techniques. (36) ;

grassland grazing habitat throughout the western United States. A controlled chaining
experiment on a surface lithic site in eastern Utah indicates that the soil disturbance

on surface and subsurface archaeological remains. These impacts can be quantified and
discussed in terms of artifact displacement, breakage, and churning. Some suggestions for
mitigating these impacts are considered. (42)
Yarnell, Richard (see Chapman, Jefferson) (36)
Yellen, John &. (Smithsonian), CULTURAL AND NATURAL PROCESSES IN FAUNAL
ASSEMBLAGE FORMATION: A !KUNG BUSHMAN EXAMPLE. Butchering, like all
cultural processes, is governed by implicit and explicit rules. These rules are, in part, related
to such factors as the size and the anatomical part of the species involved, and to the kinds
of butchering tools employed; for such reasons marked cross-cultural similarities may be
noted. But other aspects of this process may best be conceived as “‘stylistic’’ in nature, and
this raises the possibility of comparing excavated faunal assemblages as one may deal with
sherds or lithic materials. The non-random preservation of faunal remains in an
archaeological context provides a major stumbling block to this approach since cultural
patterns may be distorted or totally obscured. Also, natural patterns may easily be confused
with cultural ones. Bone refuse, collected from !Kung Bushmen in carefully controlled
situations provides a basis for studying cultural patterns. Simitar remains recovered from
campsites that had been abandoned for varying periods of time then allow one to examine
the non-random natural forces that are also at work. (20)

assemblages from an ecologically defined region. Little effort has been devoted to the
exploration and comparison of various multivariate techniques for such analysis. These
techniques may provide, among other things, a key to the deployment of human
populations within a region over time by comparison with a matrix of possibilities derived
from both ecosystemic and ethnographic data. The southwest Umnak region of the Aleutian
Islands provides an excellent body of test data for such multivariate techniques as various
kinds of distance measures, cluster analysis, and Q-mode, and R-mode factor analysis.
Results of these analyses are compared and contfasted, and suggGstions are Made CONCEMIINY
