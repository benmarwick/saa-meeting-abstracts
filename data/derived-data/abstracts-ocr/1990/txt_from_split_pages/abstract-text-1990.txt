, ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
joi] COLUMBIAN CONSEQUENCES, PART I: THE NATIVE CONTEXT OF EARLY
COLONIALISM IN SOUTHERN MESOAMERICA AND CENTRAL AMERICA
These papers emphasize the nature of Indian responses to Spanish colonialism during the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries in the Maya region and Central America. The authors recognize the impact
of such colonial phenomena as military conquest, epidemic disease, missionary activity, forced
sribute and labor, and resettlement practices as powerful instruments of external social and cultural
transformation. Beyond this, however, they emphasize that in responding to these forces of change
mative societies creatively reconstructed and adapted preconquest cultural Strategies in order to
survive as “Indians” in the new colonial order.
03] DOLLARS AND SENSE OF FEDERAL ARCHAEOLOGY PROGRAMS
Representatives of the National Park Service, the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Land Manage-
ment, and the Forest Service will analyze their current archaeology programs, emphasizing compliance
archacology. Data will include total agency costs for archacology, how costs are distributed (e. g., to
agency salaries, travel, etc.; to contracts for fieldwork and other services). Representatives of institu-
tions and private firms engaged in contract archaeology will evaluate the federal agencies’ programs
trom the contractor's perspective. All participants will assess the effectiveness of the agency programs
and will identify major problem areas. Discussants will critique the presentations and give summary
overviews.
{07} CURRENT RESEARCH IN WESTERN LAKES AND MARSHES
This session integrates recent studies of biogeographical and archaeological issues relating to
changing conditions in and around wetlands of the West. Archaeological sequences from terminal
Pleistocene through late Holocene times indicate changes in foraging practices, group composition
and mobility, and these are thought to be linked to both broad scale environmental changes as well
as to local histories of landscape, biotic and hydrologic conditions.
[08] THE ROCKY MARRIAGE BETWEEN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND CRM
A perennial problem in modern archaeology is the melding of legitimate research domains with
pressing management demands and constraints. The Navajo “New Lands” project, involving surveys
and excavation in a 149,739 ha addition to the Navajo reservation in NE Arizona, exemplifies the
issue: the client places continually changing management constraints on the archacology, yet is
willing to fund a comprehensive research program for the region. Papers present research strategies
which maximize research aims within the arbitrary limitations of management. Discussants explore
the current state of the art in CRM research generally.
[09] NEW PERSPECTIVES ON EARLY CERAMICS AND FORMATIVE CULTURE IN THE
AMERICAS
This session brings together scholars investigating the earliest ceramic-producing cultures in north-
western South America, Central America, and southern Mexico to interpret new data on the emer-
gence of ceramic technology. It is clear that pottery came into use at different times in a variety of
cultural and ecological settings. The papers will examine the social and adaptational contexts for
early ceramics, and compare patterns for changes and conginuities in social and technological systems
which accompanied the introduction of this new technology.
[13] SAVE THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE
One of the major challenges facing the profession today is the preservation of our archaeological
data base. Without this data base, we will all become “armchair archaeologists.’ Meetthg this chal-
lenge includes a variety of elements such as public education and law enforcement. Perhaps most
importantly, it includes education of the profession itself and fyture generations of archacologists
concerning their own responsibility to address this problem. This symposium will discuss and present
the results of the Society's Save the Past for the Future Project, an important step in this process, and
will suggest ways that we can help meet the challenge.
[14] SEASONAL USE OF SITES BY AGRICULTURALISTS
With the recognition that a wide variety of adaptive strategies were used by prehistoric agricultural
populations of the American Southwest, archaeologist have begun to examine sites that were season-
ally used by farmers to gain insights into these strategies. Sites with seasonal occupations can result
from a variety of factors: residential mobility patterns, specialized procurement trips, or farming
activities. For example, pithouse villages and fieldhouses are sites that have been argued to be
45

seasonally occupied but reflect very different adaptive strategies. This symposium will examine how
seasonally used sites can provide critical information about various strategies used by prehistoric
southwestern farmers,

[15] RECENT RESEARCH IN THE LARGO-GALLINA REGION OF NORTH-CENTRAL NEW

MEXICO
The Largo-Gallina culture of north-central New Mexico represents a potentially unique high-
altitude adaptation that occurred between A.D. 1000-1300. Situated in a context peripheral to the

well-known Chaco and Mesa Verde regions, hundreds of Pueblo Il and Pueblo MI sites in the 3600-

square-mile area remain remote today. Recent research has focused on a variety of descriptive,

organizational, and community-level studies. This symposium examines various facets of the Largo-

Gallina phenomenon. Papers include discussions of historic context, ceramics, architectural forms,

site location studies, communication networks, social organization, and future research strategies.
[16] CELTIC CHIEFDOM—CELTIC STATE
This symposium examines models for the structures of prehistoric and carly historic European
Celtic polities, drawing upon archaco-geographical data, Celtic literature and laws, material culture,
and theory from the humanities and social sciences. An examination of Celtic societies at different
levels of organizational complexity, from several different disciplinary perspectives should lead to
the exploration of more general questions concerning the character of early European states and
chiefdoms. Such questions include the nature of the transition of chiefdom to state organization 1n
Europe, and the viability and applicability of cross-cultural models of social evolution.
[17] ANASAZI REGIONAL ORGANIZATION AND THE CHACO SYSTEM
Continuing studies of the structure and distribution of Anasazi communities in the northem
Southwest have produced new insights regarding the evolution of the Chaco cultural expression.
Significant recent contributions include further delineation of regional settlement patterns and the
associated road networks. Attention is directed towards the roles of geography, landscape, architec-
ture, material culture and the road networks as they relate to evolving ritual systems and interaction
networks. The structure of post-Bonito phase communities in the San Juan Basin is also addressed.
Recent definitions of the Chaco phenomenon will be evaluated within the framework of Anasazi
regional organization.
[18] HOLISTIC ARCHAEOLOGY: BEYOND THE MATERIALIST-IDEALIST OPPOSITION
In the heat of debate between processual and post-processual archaeologists, polarization has occur-
red, and prominent scholars define their perspectives primarily in opposition to others. As a result,
significant aspects of theory and practice in contemporary archaeology are going unrecognized, Con-
trary to the rhetoric of competing ideologues, the materialist and idealist paradigms are not intninsi-

« cally incompatible, and high-level explanation requires their integration in @ broader theoretical
framework. In the last decade, archaeologists in several regions of the world have without fireworks
done comprehensive, problem-oriented research, with results that illuminate the processes of human
existence.

[19] TIGER ON THE HORIZON: A REEXAMINATION OF “CHINESE INFLUENCES" ON THE
MANCHURIAN BASIN AND KOREAN PENINSULA
This symposium examines the term “Chinese influences” and the phenomena of culrural interac-
tion ascribed to it. The nationalistic implications of the term are challenged as well as its implied
unidirectionality. The papers focus on regional development and interaction, dealing with questions
of ethnic identity, acculturation, and mechanisms of information transfer. The time frame under
consideration is the Korean Bronze and Iron Ages (ca. 1000 BC-300 AD) and the corresponding
Chinese Zhou and Han periods (ca. 1100 BC-220 AD).
[20] GAMBLING ON AGGREGATION: RISKS AND REASONS FOR THE FORMATION OF
AGGREGATED COMMUNITIES IN PRESTATE SETTINGS
The shift from dispersed hamlets to villages has been characterized as a relatively brief formative
period that gives way to complex, socially stratified societies. Research over the last decade demon-
strates that this unilinear evolutionary framework is flawed and that the shift between aggregated
and dispersed settlements 1m prestate societies is a complex and sometimes recurring phenomenon.
Examples of village formation and abandonment will be examined from a variety of time periods and
worldwide settings. The symposium will focus on both the processes that result in aggregation
and the organizational and economic differences between aggregated and dispersed communities in
prestate settings.

{21| FROM KOSTENKI TO CLOVIS: STALKING THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS
This session will present synthetic papers on our current state of knowledge about Late Paleolithic
and Palevindian hunter-gatherer adaptation in Eurasia{Western and Central Europe and the USSR)
and North America. It will focus on both the similarities and differences as well as on some of the
reasons for the analogies and disparities in the record. The session will stress that while much
understanding about cultural practices during the time period in question has been gained by research
conducted independently in the US and USSR, a number of significant questions aabout late Pleisto-
cene adaptations can only be answered by taking a global perspective and engaging in collaborative
research.
[23] COLUMBIAN CONSEQUENCES, PART II; RETROSPECTIVE ON A CENTURY OF
BORDERLANDS SCHOLARSHIP
This symposium looks retrospectively at the impact of previous Columbus-related ‘celebrations’ —
specifically the Chicago World’s Fair of 1893. Papers explore how the 1893 gathering (and other similar
events) reflected contemporary perspectives and shaped the direction of scholarly research in the next
century.
(26) SAVE THE PAST FOR THE FUTURE
The Society for American Archaeology has become increasingly alarmed at the rate the archaeologi-
cal resource base of this country is diminishing due to vandalism, looting and erosion, If we cannot
seccessfully combat this problem, we will be reduced to pursuing our profession from arm-chairs or
en museum basements. Since we are so few, it is imperative that we pursue cooperative ventures with
ether interested groups, or we will not be successful in saving the past for the benefit of future
archacologists and the public. This plenary session's participants will discuss various perspectives on
developing successful coalitions with other organizations and the need for educating the American
public on the value of protecting our cultural heritage.
[27] PERSONAL MORALS AND DISCIPLINARY IMPERATIVES: ETHICAL ARCHAEOLOGY
AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL ETHICS
Archacology has devoted relatively little attention to the ethical requirements of our discipline
eutside those related to Cultural Resource Management and, recently, the treatment of human
skeletal remains. However, all archaeologists make ethical decisions in their work, often without
realizing it. This symposium discusses a range of ethical problems in archaeology, focusing on the
istinction between the practice of archaeology in accordance with the personal ethics of individual
atchacologists and the ethical standards required by the nature of our discipline. Topics considered
imclude excavation practices, reburial, interactions with Native Americans, international research,
treatment of collections, and public archaeology.
[28] THE ARCHAIC OF THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES AND NORTHERN MEXICO
Some of the ancient populations which gave rise to the Formative cultures in Mesoamerica and the
American Southwest had their beginnings in the arid —— and bolsons of the Sierra Madres, and
Basin and Range respectively. To date the origin and [estyles of these early hunting and gathering
ealtures have never been well understood. Yet, these were among the oldest continuous cultural
ereditions in North America. This symposium explores the dynamics of the environment, human
cultural history, and lifeways to establish a baseline of archaeological knowledge for this poorly
known region of southern North Amenica., ‘
129] THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF SPATIAL ORGANIZATION IN EUROPE
The papers in this symposium explore economic, political, social, and ritual meanings in the use
ef space by Europeans from the Iron Age through the Middle Ages. The ways that cagmmunities
oganize their settlement space reflects, and determines, the priority they give to specifig economic,
political, and ritual activities. Archaeologically recognizable changes in systems of spatial patterning
enable us to identify major changes in culture. Topics of individual papers range in scale from the
exganization of space within individual houses to the siting of monuments in landscapes.
120] FIRES AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD: DEPOSITIONAL AND POST-
DEPOSITIONAL FORMATION PROCESSES
Recent forest fires in the western United States have caused vast resources to be focused upon the
study of the causes and effects of fires. Fires are an integral force in North American ecosystems.
However, despite the emphasis that has been placed recently upon understanding the archaeological
record in more dynamic terms, there is still a dearth of knowledge concerning the effect of fires on
cultural deposits and the means for discerning natural (fortuitous effects) from cultural (intentional
efiects) fires. This symposium was organized to gather current knowledge of how fires influence,
distort, and cause archaeological deposits.
, 48 [31] Beyond Structuralism and the Symbolic
[31] BEYOND STRUCTURALISM AND THE SYMBOLIC: KEY THEMES AND DIRECTIONS IN
POST-PROCESSUAL ARCHAEOLOGY
The aim of the session is to give a synoptic presentation of what has been termed ‘post-processual’
archaeology, with an emphasis less on polemic and critique and more on practical workings with
material culture and the past. Not to provide methodologies or ‘case studies’, but to locate the abstract
and the general in particular encounters with the past and its representation. The papers will focus
on the following themes: narrative, style, writing material culture and the past; dialectics of the past
and present, theory and practice; the politics of academic discourse; archaeology and cultural critique;
epistemology; gender, past and present; the form of a social archacology.
|32] PREHISTORIC HUNTER-GATHERER ADAPTATIONS ON THE INTERIOR PLATEAUS OF
NORTHWEST AMERICA
Hunter-fisher-gatherers occupied the interior Plateau of Northwestern America throughout prehis-
tory, beginning as free-ranging Clovis hunters and culminating as highly-organized, semisedentary,
broad-spectrum collectors. The first archaeologists to study this diverse region sketched the broad
outlines of evolving adaptations, and it is their findings that continue to be repeated in textbooks.
However, two decades of intensive research have elaborated on and modified that outline, identifying
long, detailed sequences valuable for theory building about hunter-gatherer behavior, A change in the
discipline’s understanding of the region is overdue. This symposium assembles the active researchers
to present an up-to-date chronological and thematic view of prehistory in this long-negiected area.
[34] ALASKAN NATIVE DISPERSAL AROUND THE NORTH PACIFIC UNDER THE RUSSIAN-
AMERICAN COMPANY: ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE
The Russian-American Fur Company and its immediate predecessors (ca.1742- 1867) in their hunt
for the valuable furs of the sea otter (Enhydra lutris), forcibly employed the help of skilled kayak
hunters from Alaska. These included Aleuts, Kodiak Eskimos, and costal Athabaskan Indians. They
were carried to the far reaches of the North Pacific extending from the Kune Islands to Baja California.
The session papers will concentrate on a variety of archacological sites occupied by these Alaskan
natives with a view toward similarities and differences in retention of their tools and customs and
transference to new customs and technology.
[36] RECONSTRUCTING SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL IN
MESOAMERICA
Excavation of households has become a recognized fucus of research in Mesoamerican archaeology.
Moving beyond the preliminary description of architecture and artifacts this symposium goes one
step further, to the reconstruction of intra-site social dynamics. The papers represent various areas
of Mesoamerica to provide regional perspective. The authors employ different methods to address the
question of household organization, such as analysis of activity areas or ethnoarchaeological studies.
In several cases there is sufficient information to make comparisons between sites, rural and urban
areas, or commoner and elite status.
(37) CURRENT ISSUES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION
Issues associated with the concept of in-situ archaeological site protection and preservation as a
viable management alternative to large-scale data recovery or avoidance options are of critical concem
to the idea of a conservation ethic in archaeology. These issues vary according to diverse patterns in
land management approaches, land and resource use, visitor impacts, and research orientations. The
papers in this session examine these issues from various perspectives and incorporate discussions of
several related themes, including site protection/preservation project planning and implementation,
agency-specific regulations and policies, project monitoring, ongoing research avenues, and future
research needs.
[38] ALTERNATIVE ADAPTATIONS TO ARID ENVIRONMENTS: THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF
THE SOUTHERN GREAT BASIN
The southern Great Basin of North America ranks among the most arid environments in the world.
The archaeological record of human occupation in the region reveals a variety of adaptations to
this harsh regime. Drawing on abundant recent archaeological research in the southern Basin, this
symposium examines what we know of the variety of human adaptations there, and addresses
several issues concerning human adaptation to arid environments generally: 1) the scale of regional
adaptations to arid settings; 2) variability in occupation of arid regions; and 3) the relationships
between occupation of arid environments and occupation of more congenial environments.
{42} LIFE ABOVE THE TREELINE: PATTERNS OF PREHISTORIC ALPINE LAND-USE IN
WESTERN NORTH AMERICA
The alpine and sub-alpine communities of western North American mountain ranges are marginal
environments that contain exquisitely detailed records of prehistoric land-use. These records are more
, [53] Paleoindian Adaptations in Southwestern Nebraska 49
intact, more easily dated, and more readily related to models of paleoclimate than those normally
available from lower settings. Montane archaeological research in California, Nevada, and Colorado
illustrates the many advantages of studying hunter-gatherer adaptation from the alpine perspective
and documents the particular sensitivity of alpine subsistence and settlement to climatic, demo-
graphic, and technological change. Common to these studies is the assumption that alpine archacology
is useful primarily for the light it sheds on regional adaptation.
[44] THE SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF SYMBOLIC EXPRESSION IN THE PREHISTORIC
AMERICAN SOUTHWEST
Archaeologist, anthropologist, and art historians working in the American Southwest now have
sufficient information on prehistoric design to assess the social implications of those designs. The
context/social landscape in which particular motifs occur and their temporal development are
explored in attempting to derive meaning from the designs. Particular attention is paid to cross-media
analysis, and methods for deriving meaning are discussed. Ultimately, the possible relationships
between design “messaging” and significant changes in Southwestern society are explored.
[45] WRITING FOR POPULAR JOURNALS
A workshop designed to sharpen archaeologists’ writing skills and strengthen their understanding
of the needs of general-interest publications. Informal discussions and brief workshop activities will
focus on the “human interest” requirements of popular writing—the need to be colorful, entertaining
and provocative. Structuring a tight essay, finding the right tone, and editing one’s own work will be
among the many topics discussed. The co-organizers will draw from their experience as editors of
ARCHAEOLOGY Magazine in considering how the magazine goes about finding material, generating
new ideas, and collaborating successfully with authors from the assignment stage to final page proofs.
[46] FRYXELL SYMPOSIUM 1990: THE STATE OF INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH IN
ARCHAEOLOGY
This symposium reviews the role and potential of interdisciplinary research in contemporary
archaeology. The specialization that is now common among archaeologists may fragment the informa-
tion that is obtained about a particular problem, despite the holistic goals of the field. A new phase
of research must emerge, in which communication between specialists will allow comparison
and evaluation of complementary data. These papers examine data sets, methods of comparison, and
theoretical models that exemplify productive application of these intra-disciplinary research
strategies.
[48] COLUMBIAN CONSEQUENCES, PART II: BEYOND DISCIPLINARY BIAS: FUTURE
DIRECTIONS IN CONTACT PERIOD RESEARCH
In the past 100 years archacological and historical knowledge of the Columbian period has changed
substantially due to structural changes in disciplines and to the weight of empirical observations.
Despite these changes, there are major problems in our perceptions, explanations and description of
the contact period. In this symposium, problems relating to effect of disciplinary biases in archaeology,
history, and demography are discussed, Future directions i Columbian period research are suggested.
Areal coverage ranges from the Southeastern United States to Hawaii.
[50] THE AZTEC CITY-STATE OF OTUMBA: A CASE STUDY IN CITY-STATE POLITICAL
AND ECONOMIC EVOLUTION
Recent surface surveys and surface collections at the Aztke city-state capital of Orumba, Mexico
(TA-80), and at several dependent sites, along with excavations at Otumba, have provided detailed
data on craft production (obsidian, groundstone, figurines, fibers, lapidary), the distribution of craft
products, the sequence of construction in the nucleated core, and agricultural intensification. These
were important in the development, functioning, and decline of the Orumba city-state fromica. 1300
to 1560. The symposium papers present details of these data and their implications for Aztec political
and economic evolution in other areas in the Basin of Mexico. 4
[52] WINDOWS ON THE PAST; PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT IN CRM
WINDOWS ON THE PAST is an outreach program designed to enhance the educational and
recreational experiences on National Forests by developing opportunities to visit, learn about, and
participate in archaeological and historical projects. We will present an overview of the Windows
program, its goals and objectives, and some of the products and potential products being considered
in each region of the country.
[53] PALEOINDIAN ADAPTATIONS IN SOUTHWESTERN NEBRASKA PHASE I: PREVIOUS
RESEARCH, PALEOENVIRONMENTAL DATA, AND THE ALLEN SITE
Salvage excavations in the Medicine Creek Drainage in SW Nebraska during the 1940's and 1950's
produced substantial collections from a series of early Holocene sites, collections which have never
, 50 [55] Late Quaternary Paleoenvironments
been fully analyzed. The Medicine Creek Paleo Project is a 5 year program of research centered on
these sites. This session summarizes previous work at Medicine Creek and presents the results of the
first year of the current project, with a major emphasis on 1) field geomorphic/paleoenvironmental
studies, 2) evidence for a previously undetected Clovis occupation of the drainage, and 3) analysis of
extensive, well-documented existing collections from the Allen Site (25FT50),
[55] LATE QUATERNARY PALEOENVIRONMENTS: PALEOCLIMATIC INTERPRETATIONS
AND ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS
Surveys, new excavations, and reexcavations in the Levant over the past decade have greatly
increased the data base on Late Quaternary paleoenvironments. Paleoclimatic information, generated
by the recovery of pollen, macrobotanical, geomorphological and paleontological data, indicates that
the Levant was subjected to a series of humid and cool phases, separated by relatively dry and warm
ones. The archacological responses to these shifts in paleoclimates is the subject of this symposium.
[56] ABANDONMENT PROCESSES: STRUCTURES AND SITES
Abandonment is critical to site formation, Abandonment processes determine the spatial pattern-
ing, organizational structure, and composition of archaeological remains. This symposium will define
abandonment processes and identify variability generated by abandonment in the archaeological
record at the level of the individual structure. Papers use ethnographic, ethnoarchaeological, and
archacological data to isolate the range of factors conditioning abandonment of structures within sites
and to develop criteria for their archaeological recognition.
[58] THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE
The concept of cultural landscape is used to analyze the dynamic tension between land usc and
social action. The cultural landscape links the humanly-created physical world with the symbolic
meaning implicit in that world. The built environment serves as the location of economic relations
and provides the symbolic context in which those relations occur. The concept has applications not
only for archaeology but for general anthropological theory as well. Papers in this symposium use
cultural landscape to explicate the active links between social relations and the built environment.
[59] SMALL SITES IN THE BIG PICTURE: THE IMPORTANCE OF SMALL SITES IN
UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATION IN THE PREHISTORIC SOUTHWEST
Although regional settlement surveys have been conducted for many years in the Southwest,
characterizations of late prehistoric subsistence activities and social organization continue to be
largely derived from investigations at only a small number of aggregated villages. Evidence from
temporary habitation sites and a wide variety of agricultural facilities broadly distributed across the
prehistoric landscape have often been neglected because these remains are considered to be peripheral |
to residential core areas. Fields, hunting and gathering sites, and shrines are integral components
of the community. The placement of these sites offer primary information for understanding the
organization of prehistoric communities.
[62] INTERACTION SPHERES IN THE CARIBBEAN
Interaction involves the exchange of tangibles and intangibles through which relations between
individuals, communities, societies, and cultures are established and maintained. The definite terres-
trial boundaries of islands and their differences in physical variables (size, isolation, resources) create
unique opportunities for the study of interaction. Papers in this symposium make use of the laboratory-
like conditions in the Caribbean islands to investigate interactions at different times, in different |
parts of the Caribbean, among different cultures, and at various scales. The combined effect is an
elucidation of the interplay of cultural and physical variables in the development of Caribbean
cultures.
[64] IMAGE AND INFORMATION IN THE AZTEC WORLD
The Aztec world encompassed urban capitals, towns, and rural villages in many provinces that
were welded together into a single political entity, the Aztec empire. Within the empire, material
objects conveyed information about individuals’ political position, social class, ethnic affiliation, and
religious beliefs. Papers in this symposium examine explicitly visible items such as art works,
architecture and personal accessories, as well as less visible objects, as conveyors of information in
this multi-ethnic state. Urban-rural, elite-commoner, and capital-provincial distributions of artifacts
and information are considered.
{66] CRM DATABASES: ORGANIZATIONAL, TECHNICAL AND ETHICAL ISSUES FOR THE
1990S
This symposium addresses the development and use of CRM databases in the United States, Canada
and Great Britain planned for the 1990s. Attention is given to the managerial, technical and ethical

examined to identify the solutions at present perceived.
[68] THE IRVINE COAST ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT: ARCHAEOMETRY AND
CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
The Irvine Coast Archaeological Project is a large privately funded archaeological data recovery
project which encompasses 30 sites in a 4.4 square mile area of coastal Orange Country, California.
The project emphasizes large scale horizontal exposures to recover features (usually hearths) and
associated artifacts and faunal remains. Over 2000 cubic meters of excavated earth have been processed
through water screens. Archaeometric techniques, including radiocarbon dating, thermal remnant
magnetism, carbon isotope ratios, oxygen isometry, geophysical remote sensing, and pollen and
macrobotanical studies, have contributed important data regarding environmental reconstruction,
and the location, age, and seasonality of features.
[70] CRAFT SPECIALIZATION IN COMPLEX SOCIETIES: EVIDENCE FROM ANALYSES OF
STONE TOOLS
Now that techniques for deriving a variety of data from stone tools have been developed, lithic
analysis has become a feasible way to study craft specialties which involve the use of stone tools.
This symposium brings together researchers working in different areas of the world on questions of
craft specialization in settings of complex societies. Presenters draw on lithic functional! data, usewear
studies and consumption patterns of stone tools employed in various occupations to explore specific
craft activities in depth and to address general questions of craft production and exchange within
occupationally specialized societies. .
[71|) THINKING ABOUT EATING
Food is meaningful from every anthropological perspective. Although sociocultural anthropologists
have investigated the many roles of food in culture, archaeologists have viewed food remains primarily
as a reflection of diet and subsistence production. Here we explore the social and symbolic dimensions
ot food and eating through ethnographic, ethnohistoric, and archaeological data. Although diverse in
time, space, and approach, the studies all demonstrate that the practice of eating is the fundamental
nexus of the economic, the political, and the ideological in culture, suggesting therefore that a
consideration of the multiple roles of food should promote greater understanding of past societies.
[73] BEYOND THE BLACK SAND: SEVENTY-FIVE YEARS OF ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE
FLAGSTAFF AREA
Systematic archaeological research in the Flagstaff area commenced in 1916 when Harold and Mary-
Russell Ferrel] Colton initiated their first archaeological survey. In the intervening 75 years, a variety
of researchers, representing a wide diversity of theoretical orientations and methodological
approaches, have contributed to the formation of an gees: data base on prehistoric settlement
patterns, social organization, material culture distribuffons, and environmental change. This panel
essesses the relevance, representativeness, and quality of that data base with respect to contemporary
research questions in Southwestern Archacology and suggests new avenues of data collection and
interpretation.
{74| ALTERNATIVE LIVELIHOODS: INVESTIGATING PREHISTORIC SUBSISTENCE
CHANGE
This symposium highlights current approaches to the study of prehistoric subsistence change that
go beyond simple calorie counting to dynamic investigations of options for survival. While weuees
and methodological orientations among the participants vary, contributions consistently feature a
holistic examination of the subject. The assembled papers consider evidence for subsistence change
among both hunter-gatherers and agriculturalists in non-state and syate level societies, Data bearing
on environment, technology, resource and population stress, food procurement and production, and
settlement pattern are featured. Geographical foci include the Southwest, the Northwest Coast,
California, the Eastern Woodlands, Mesoamerica, the Andes, and the Near East.
175] REEVALUATING SOCIAL AND ADAPTIVE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE NORTHERN
CADDOAN ARCHAEOLOGICAL REGION
Recent research in the Arkansas River Valley and the Ozark Highland region of eastern Oklahoma
and western Arkansas has enhanced understanding of social and ecological dynamics during the
Late Woodland and Mississippi Periods, when mound centers signal the development of socicties
traditionally labelled “Arkansas Valley Caddoan”. Current concerns include site hierarchy formation,
strength and directions in economic, social, and ritual interaction, degree of affinity with Red River

tion. This symposium brings together archaeologist and biological anthropologist with new perspec-
tives on this western version of ranked, farming, Mississippian-related culture.
[77] RECENT FIELD RESEARCH ON THE PERUVIAN MIDDLE HORIZON |

This symposium will present the results of recent research on the Wari Empire of Middle Horizon
Peru. Participants from several research projects will discuss the results of current field work from i
the site of Pikillacta in the Cuzco Valley, and also from the Chuquibamba Valley in the Southern
Highlands, and the Inca and Nazca Valleys of the South Coast. Topics addressed will include Wari ‘
settlement patterns on the both the coast and in the highlands, Wari architectural technology and
function, aspects of Wari ritual behavior reflected in architecture, analysis of midden deposition
patterns at Pikillacta, and an analysis of human mortuary remains from the context of Wari offerings
and burials.
[78] RESEARCH DESIGNS IN THE SECTION 106 PROCESS

An integral aspect of the review of Federal archaeological projects under Section 106 of the National
Historic Preservation Act is the development of research designs and data recovery plans which
evidence that effects to archaeological properties can be negated or mitigated. Federal archaeologist,
State Historic Preservation Office archaeologists, and archacological contractors will discuss the role
of research designs and the role of the reviewer in the Section 106 process. Observed problems and
weaknesses in current research designs will be presented, and the logistics of preparing research
designs for favorable review will be examined.
[79] SAMPLING, TIME, SPACE, AND POPULATION ALONG THE MIDDLE SAN JUAN RIVER

One hundred years of archaeological surveys in the northern Four Comers region have established
general understanding of the cultural sequences and population dynamics of this area. Much of this
work has been highly subjective or poorly disseminated. This symposium is based on recent and
extensive, systematic survey conducted in advance of seismic exploration in extreme southeast Utah.
It provides a significant contribution to the understanding of cultural diversity, change, and land use
along the middle San Juan River. The effectiveness and reliability of seismic lines as transect samples
for projecting archaeological content over a broad area is tested.
[81] THE ZAGROS PALEOLITHIC: NEW PERSPECTIVES ON ANCIENT HUMANS IN THE

MIDDLE EAST

The Zagros region of the Middle East has a long and varied record of archaeological fieldwork,
beginning in earnest with D.A.E. Garrod in the late 1920s. However, with few exceptions, little
detailed information on Middle, Upper, and Epi-Paleolithic occupations has been available. Our
understanding of the Middle Eastern Paleolithic has thus had a distinctly Levantine bias. This sympo-
sium redresses this problem with the presentation of new analyses of data from early and recent
fieldwork in the Zagros, incorporating a variety of interpretive views. Presentations explore both the
data from particular sites, as well as synthetic overviews of Zagros Paleolithic occupation.
[82] ABANDONMENT PROCESSES: SEASONAL VARIATION AND REGIONAL MOBILITY

Abandonment is a key process in the formation of the archacological record. The causes, circum-
stances and scale of abandonment condition the spatial patterning, organizational structure, and
composition of archaeological remains. The definition of abandonment processes and the identifica-
tion of the variability generated by abandonment remain crucial analytical goals. This symposium
combines ethnographic, ethnoarchacological and archaeological data to explore temporary, long-term
and seasonal abandonment of sites within a framework of regional mobility.
[84] PREHISTORIC HAWAIIAN FOOD PRODUCTION: REGIONAL DIVERSITY

A variety of food production strategies can be identified for the prehistoric period in the Hawaiian
Islands. Yet, too often only the irrigated form of agriculrure is represented in the archaeological
literature for this region. This symposium first considers the range of food production strategies—
spanning shifting to fixed field systems—that characterize Hawai'i. Next, the relationships between
different strategies and either social (e.g.,increasing complexity in authority) or ecological (e.g., varying
amounts of rainfall) conditions are evaluated using data from the Hawaiian Islands. These studies
demonstrate considerable regional heterogeneity in food production that must be integrated into
explanations of Polynesian prehistory.
[86] HUNTER/GATHERER LACUSTRINE ADAPTATIONS

Cycles of lacustrine resource productivity at long and short term scales of variation can figure

extraction is keyed to lake ecology and geography, hunter/gatherer density, gender based task divi-

sions, mobility patterns, territorial strategies, sociopolitical complexity, technology, nutrition, and
other aspects of behavior. Resultant regularities in the organization of archacological assemblages,
activity areas, sites and regions reflect the interaction of these variables. This symposium explores
these interrelationships through a series of case studies from Africa, Asia, Europe and North America
spanning the last one million years.

[33] HOHOKAM CERAMIC EXCHANGE WITHIN THE SALT RIVER VALLEY, ARIZONA: |
RESULTS FROM THE HOHOKAM EXPRESSWAY PROJECT
The Salt River Valley, Arizona is characterized by distinct zones of mutually distinguishable rock
types. Preliminary results indicate that as much as 90 percent of al! the Hohokam plain and red ware
pottery from the Salt River Valley can be correlated with one of these specific zones. The distributional |
pattern of these geologic units can be combined with a map of the prehistoric canal systems, which
facilitates the study of ceramic exchange within and between several irrigation communities, The
ceramic analysis for the on-going Hohokam Expressway project includes a synthesis of previously
derived petrographic information, geological data, 300 new petrographic samples, and microprobe
chemical assays.

[44] ORIGINS OF THE PUEBLO KATSINA CULT: ICONOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE
About A.D. 1300 there was a major shift in the decorative systems of the groups inhabiting the
“puebloan” region of the American Southwest. The shift has been documented in such decorative
media as ceramics, rock art, and kiva murals. The shift corresponds with major population dislocation
and relocation and aggregation into large pueblos. Anthropomorphic icons in the new decorative
system suggest that the shift corresponds with the development of the katsina cult. this paper explores
this relationship.

[47] UNDERSTANDING THE USE OF GROUNDSTONE TOOLS THROUGH
EXPERIMENTATION
Experimentation is used as a method for understanding what happens to the surface of granular
handstones during use. Both food and nonfood substances were processed and the used surfaces were
analyzed. Using low-power magnification it Is possible to determine how various substances damage
the surface of the stone. Variation in the damage relates to the rigidity of the surface against which
the handstone was used and the intermediary effects of the ground substance. These results have
direct application to the interpretation of the use of prehistoric ground stane tools.

[20] POPULATION AGGREGATION AND THE CHANGING SOCIAL LANDSCAPE: LATE
PREHISTORIC ANASAZI SETTLEMENTS ON THE NORTHERN COLORADO PLATEAU
Explanations of the development of Northern Anasazi villages have often taken a ‘Chinese box”’
approach, describing the settlements as aggreganons of increasingly larger arrangements of house-
holds, household groups, groups of groups, and so on. This organic approach ignores the fact that the
‘ social systems that regulate access to productive resources {i.c., land tenure) function differently in
aggregated and dispersed settlement systems. Data from archaeological investigations in southwestern
Colorado and cross-cultural analysis of land tenure systems are employed in stressing the attendant
changes in the “social landscape” associated with an increasingly aggregated settlement system.

A cache of 28-32 Pueblo Ill coiled and plaited baskets was plundered from Horse Rock Ruin
(42SA13182), Monticello Ranger District, Manti-LaSal Nationa! Forest, San Juan County, Utah. The
US Forest Service recovered most of the collection, which was used as tial evidence. The baskets were
then sent to the Perishables Analysis Facility, Cultural Resource Management Program, University of
Pittsburgh, for analysis and publication. Technical attributes of the basketry are described and dis-
cussed, and the collection is compared to other contemporary Pueblo [I assemblages from the study
area. The Horse Rock Ruin cache, like the assemblage recently described from Antelope House,
Arizona, illustrates the well-developed regionalization and great technical and aesthetic sophistica-
tion of Pueblo If! perishable manufacture.

contexts. Burn effects were common on surface artifacts, being most severe for small items and
organic remains. Certain effects from controlled prairie burning are distinguishable from thermal
effects on many archaeological specimens, with the latter frequently being far more severe. One can
conclude that, in prairie/grassland settings, effects from natural fire can be distinguished from effects
from cultural fire, a finding of significance to behavioral interpretations of sites of recent to great
antiquity.

Excavations conducted hetween 1952 and 1987 at Modoc Rock Shelter (11-R-5) in southwestern
Illinois have resulted in the documentation of over 9 meters of stratified deposits in two separate
shelter areas. The stratigraphic sequences within the site are summarized, and the suite of 55 radiocar-
bon dates associated with the strata are discussed. The stratigraphy and chronology of Modoc provide
2 base line for interpreting culture/historical sequences in the southern Midwest region, as well as
changes in Archaic period cultural adaptations and early to middle Holocene paleocnvironmental
conditions.

The number of tree-ring dates from sites in the Flagstaff area has more than doubled since 1946,

were on hand but remained undated when Colton wrote. This evidence contributes to the dating of
structures included in Colton’s synthesis and of the ceramic groups that underlie Colton’s chronology
for the Flagstaff area. Tree-ring data also make it possible to reconstruct aspect of community history,
and they reveal patterning in the use and reuse of beams incorporated in pit structures.

[11] POSSIBILITIES AND PITFALLS: SITE DATING USING ASIAN COINS IN WESTERN
NORTH AMERICA
Can a 400 year old Chinese code be useful in dating a California gold rush site? A new systematic
survey of Asian coins found at historic sites in four western states indicates that assemblage analysis
yields previously unrecognized possibilities for site dating. Information on the circulation of coins in
the countries of origin, combined with knowledge of importation practices in different historic periods
provides a profile of coins arriving during certain narrowly-defined time penods. Comparing coin
assemblages from sites to the profile can provide dating information. An example from 19th century
California is discussed.

[70] LATE CLASSIC LOWLAND MAYA CARPENTRY AND LAPIDARY CRAFT SPECIALTIES:
THE FUNCTIONAL EVIDENCE
While it is well-known from iconography and material culture that carpentry and lapidary craft
specialists were present in Late Classic Lowland Maya society, almost nothing is known of the tools
used in these specialties and the degree to which these tools differ from those used in other crafts as
well as household activities. Furthermore, there is little known of the spatial distribution of these
crafts and the implications of that distribution for understanding the control of production of these
commodities. This paper explores the functional evidence for these specialties as derived from high-
power microwear analysis of an assemblage of lithics from center and rural contexts in the central

[25] SOCIOPOLITICAL DIVISIONS AMONG THE LATE PREHISTORIC PUNAES OF COASTAL
ECUADOR

Archaeological research undertaken on La Puna Island, south costal Ecuador strongly suggests that |
the Punaes were organized into regional sociopolitical units. Evidence for this comes from ceramic
assemblages that differ geographically with respect to decoration and form. Material from western La
Puna is nearly identical to the La Libertad pottery of the Santa Elena Peninsula; pottery from the
south is remarkably like the Garbanzal ceramics of northern Peru. Evidence indicates that Garbanzal
belongs to the Integration Period of the Ecuadorian chronology. These discoveries shed light on the
structure of Punae society and the organization of the late prehistoric trading economies of coastal
Ecuador and Peru.

[62] PREHISTORIC TAINO INTERACTION WITH THE LESSER ANTILLES: THE VIEW FROM
MARTINIQUE, F.W.I.

Archaeologists have tended to look separately at the Greater and Lesser Antilles, even during late
prehistoric times when the Greater Antilles was a major center of cultural developments. Archaeologi-
cal manifestations clearly derived or inspired by the Greater Antillean Tainos recently were identified
in late prehistoric remains on Martinique. This evidence necessitates a re-examination of the alleged
isolationism by contributing data toward the formulation of an Antillean interaction sphere in which
the central location of Martinique was significant. Taino manifestations on Martinique are described,
processes responsible for this interaction are suggested, and implications for reconstructing Suazoid
culture and society are explored. |

Fertile valley and slope soils were cultivated by A.D. 500 in windward O'ahu, using irrigated, non-
irrigated, and combined technologies. Field complexes in Kane‘ohe, Maunawili, and Kawai Nui
apparently underwent major expansions after A.D. 1200, during a period of great sociocultural change

[49] CLIMATIC VARIATION AND CULTURAL DYNAMICS IN NORTHEASTERN NORTH
AMERICA |

The relationship between climatic change and cultural dynamics for the Late Woodland period
(A.D. 900-1650) in the eastern Great Lakes is investigated. Temperature 1s a critical climatic variable,

‘ particularly among groups, such as the [roquois, near the northern limit of maize horticulture.
Climatic fluctuations in temperature and precipitation identified as the Little Climatic Optimum
(A.D. 900-1200) and the Little Ice Age (A.D, 1450-1850) occurred during this time period. Associations
between these climatic episodes and full scale adoption of horticulture, the appearance of large
villages, and the characteristic spacing arrangements of settlements and tribal groupings are examined.
Conditions are modeled using Geographic Information Systems. .

[05] THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS AND SETTLEMENT

PATTERNS IN THE LUKACHUKAI VALLEY

Bureau of Indian Affairs sponsored excavation and survey have documented three major settlement
patterns in the Lukachukai Valley of northeast Arizona. During the Basketmaker III Period, population
was dispersed throughout the region in small to medium sized habitation sites. The late Pueblo I-
early Pueblo Ill Period witnessed population aggregation in the lower part of the alluvial fan. In the
early Navajo Period, settlement was again dispersed in small units throughout the region. Changes
in settlement can be associated with different agricultural systems. A model relating population,
soils, settlement size, and site location is presented.

[54] SHIFTING SANDS: A NEW FOLSOM-MIDLAND CAMPSITE FROM THE MONAHANS
DUNES OF WESTERN TEXAS

Extensive remains of Folsom-Midland occupations have been revealed in a series of 5—8 meter deep
blowouts. Over 5000 lithic artifacts (including 500 tools) have been collected providing an important
assemblage for regional comparison. Both conservative and wasteful strategies of toolstone use are
evident which implicate evaluations of Folsom technological organization. This pattern of toolstone
use suggests situational needs often affect technological behavior. Therefore, dissecting the sequence
of tool using and manufacturing activities is critical for evaluating technological organization. Prelimi-
nary investigation of intra-site patterning indicates spatial differentiation of activities which is related
to the sequence of tool use.

[70] EXAMPLES OF TOOLS SHOWING CRAFT SPECIALIZATION ACTIVITIES IN THE
HARRAPPEAN OF PAKISTAN AND THE NEOLITHIC OF TURKEY

Enigmatic tool types found in two distinct cultural contexts, flint blades with oddly-distributed
“gloss” and heavily-abraded dentate obsidian tools, have been commonly assumed to be “sickles”.
However, microwear analysis of tools of these types from Nausharo (Harrappean, Pakistan) and Cafer
Huyuk (Neolithic, Turkey) revealed odd “mechanical-appearing” microwear traces which experiments
showed correspond most closely to the tools edges having been pressed and pivoted against particular
lithic objects (found in the same levels as the tools) in order to shape them while they were turned
on 2 wheel. In this manner, at Nausharo, humid ceramics were shaved and burnished and at Cafer

Huyuk, grooves and ridges were made on stone bracelets.

DYNAMICS IN THE NORTHERN RIO GRANDE }

. Archaeologist have long recognized the existence of extensive gravel and cobble agricultural com-
plexes in the higher latitudes and elevations of the north Rio Grande. These sites, however,
represent only a portion of the agricultural technologies usa by Anasazi farmers for coping with
unpredictable, localized environmental perturbations, In addition, the periodic large-scale occupation
of high plateaus and narrow northern valleys for diverse farming practices manifest a long-term
regional strategy to ease, whenever possible, population pressures along the Rio Grande floodplain.
The economic, social, and ideological implications of the agricultural complexes are considered in
terms of these local and regional adaptive strategies.

It is difficult to assess the relative importance of technical and non-technical factors in inferring
modes of technological decision-making in prehistory. Examination of pottery production and use
technologies among the Kalinga using both ethnoarchaeological material and laboratory analysis
demonstrates the importance of not only technical (physical properties or functional), but also behav-
ioral or social aspects of technological choices. Kalinga potters may select clays for physical properties,
or their proximity; Kalinga consumers may select pots for functional superiority, or for reasons of
village allegiance. Explaining the resulting pattern in the material record requires attention to both
technical and behavioral aspects of the pottery technology.

Site destruction, vandalism, illegal removal of artifacts, and other depredation that results in
deterioration of archacological resources threaten the very existence of our cultural heritage. The
innate fascination of people for the past can make them natural allies in preservation, if they can be
educated and convinced of its importance. Preserving the resources of history and prehistory for
eventual study may depend, ultimately, on the willingness and ability of archaeologists to reach out

the long term trends of figurine use—a more stable conclusion can be formulated. The preferred
explanation is grounded on an understanding of societies’ need to establish links across the physical
gap between the living and the dead. Based on the results of this research, a new approach can be
applied to the other ‘ritual cult’ items from the same periods and cultures.

have collapsed. Evidence from the organization of domestic architecture and other sources suggest
that fundamental differences in social organization between the two regions may have been a factor

past and present a theoretical position will be mapped in relation to the genealogies of morals and

Beginning with the Lower Pleistocene sequence at ‘Obeidiya and continuing through ephemeral
. Middle Paleolithic occurrences and Upper Paleolithic sites, lakes apparently served as “permanent”
sources of water, while their shorelines and adjacent plains provided suitable habitats for higher
frequencies of mammals. Only the Natufian culture provides ample evidence for fishing and trapping
water-fowl, a strategy later employed by the Early Neolithic farmers who were also intensive and
extensive hunters and gatherers.

which people once lived out their lives. The paper will take what is normally regarded as a large scale
phenomenon, the ‘beaker network’ of late Neolithic Europe, in an attempt to show how this may
have arisen through such local strategies of day-to-day life.

Archacometric methods are applied to Haug, Norway addressing the questions; what composes the
strata of a site; what was the mechanism of transport; from where are the strata derived; and how are
they altered by cultural activities. The techniques include; size, shape and texture analysis of sediment
particles; chemical composition using Inductive Coupled Plasma Spectrometry (ICAP}, and C13-Cl4
isotopic analysis. Columnar sampling allows inspection of the sediment between strata throughout

[78] SUFFERING THE FOOL: OBSERVATIONS ON RESEARCH DESIGNS AND CONTRACT
ARCHAEOLOGY

Although research designs (RD) are habitually prepared for archaeological projects conducted under
Section 106 of the National Historic Preservation Act, too often the utility of such documents is
compromised by unclear or missing linkages between method, theory, and the scope of work. This
paper examines the role of RDs from the perspective of the private contractor, focusing on: the scale
of the RD versus objectives and potential of the project, the quality of the RD as a measure of
anticipated performance, the good and bad of programmatic treatment plans, and the process of
reviewing RD implementation.

138] ADAPTIVE VARIATION IN THE NORTH-GENTRAL MOJAVE DESERT

One of the more barren, inhospitable areas of North America for most or all of the Holocene, the
north-central Mojave Desert nonetheless contains a remarkably diverse archaeological record that
reveals major adjustments in cultural adaptation since the end of the Pleistocene. Diachronic continu-
ity in paleoenvironmental circumstances across the region suggests that shifts in patterns of resource
exploitation, settlement structure, raw material acquisition, and residential mobility can be attributed
largely to factors other than gross environmental change. Recent research, emphasizing methodologi-
cal approaches that identify and control for the complexities of site formation, provides a basis for
exploring the dynamics of regional adaptive variability over time. \

[11] SPATIAL ANALYSIS OF APACHE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION
The relationships shared by individuals within a community are reflected in the organization of
: their residential units. Social units serve varied purposes and we can therefore expect those units to
change differently in response to external pressures. This can be observed archaeologically. The
spacing of wickiups within eight Apache camps in central Anzona are studied and changes in the
configurations of the gowa, gota, and itagota are recognized and tracked from 1890 to 1940. Changes
in these relationships are correlated with documented changes in Apache social organization caused
by participation in the American capital economy.

174] LOCATIONAL SHIFTS IN SONORAN DESERT SUBSISTENCE
By the Classic Period (ca. AD 1100), the Hohokam in the Sonoran desert in southern Arizona had
increasingly expanded production on marginal land away from major watercourses. Two existing
technologies figured in this expansion. New evidence has revealed that rreservoirs were perennial
water sources and were deployed at a number of desert-based villages. Runoff agricultural complexes
were also expanded on poorly watered valley slopes. Implications of these changes for settlement and
subsistence patterns are evaluated. Models of landuse expansion from the Tucson Basin are examined
using data from the broader Hohokam tradition.

[07] LITHIC RAW MATERIAL PROCUREMENT AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO LATE
PLEISTOCENE-EARLY HOLOCENE POPULATION MOBILITY IN THE CENTRAL GREAT
BASIN
Surprisingly little is known about the adaptive strategies practiced by late Pleistocene-early Holo-
cene human populations in the Great Basin. While we believe these populations were generalists,
| utilizing resources associated with remnant pluvial lakes, we know nothing of the ranges within
which they waveled or the degree of mobility they practiced. Using data generated over the past
four years in Butte Valley, eastern Nevada, we consider these questions. In particular, we employ
information from obsidian source and hydration studies to examine lithic raw material procurement
and its role in structuring patterns of mobility among early Great Basin inhabitants.

[55] COPING WITH STRESS: LATE QUATERNARY ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE NEAR EASTERN
DESERTS
Environmental changes in the semi-desertic belt of the Near East had various impacts on the
settlement patterns of prehistoric foragers during the Upper Pleistocene-Early Holocene. The results
of archaeological surveys and excavations analyzed in the light of current models concerning the
behavior of opportunistic scavengers and hunter-gatherers indicate that several options existed at
each situation. The outcome of the decisions made by different groups is reflected in the changes in
settlement pattern, the emergence of new types of sites and disappearance of certain entities. Desertic
environments seem to have been excluded by Mousterian humans, but somewhat more frequently
exploited during the Upper Paleolithic. Epi-Paleolithic groups were better equipped but faced some
harsh and rapid environmental changes.

“NEW LANDS”

The Navajo and Zuni Archaeology programs are involved in extensive and long-term CRM on the
“New Lands” and are determined to conduct the work in a coordinated, comprehensive, research-
eriented manner. This demands that the disparate projects within this area be organized under a
unified, re-existing research design, that research somehow be made relevant to management objec-
tives, and that other sources of support for research be pursued. We believe all these demands are
being met on the “New Lands.” This paper identifies means to ensure realization of our long term
research goals in this enormous project area.

RANGE

Intercept-hunting structures above timberline in the Front Range vary from simple blinds along
game trails to elaborate systems of U-shaped rock walls and stone-rimmed shelters. Each of >50
recorded drive sites represents a unique solution to local problems and opportunities; all share the
use of natural or man-made barriers to move large-game animals from tundra grasslands to constricted
kill areas where hunters were hidden in ambush. Radiocarbon and lichenometric dates range from
5800 to 360 yr BP. The drive systems reflect communal hunting in late summer and fall by people
sho wintered at lower clevations.

The identification and explanation of Precolumbian community patterning has been a long-term

of European contact. Site organizational patterns have long been recognized in terms of ceremonial
precincts, central plazas, ritual community areas, etc. Patterns indicative of community social organi-

difficult to identify and interpret. This paper starts from easily identifiable spatial patterns of architec-

at hypotheses concerning the social organization of the community.

Archaeological studies have attempted to account for ethnic composition and differential access to

literacy resources for different ethnic groups in an urban population. Refuse from two ethnic groups
(two Mexican-American neighborhood and one Anglo-American neighborhood) are examined for
literacy-related items. Differences in literacy materials for ethnic and sociometric defined groups are
séentified and explanations for these differences are suggested.

, | 64 Bettison, Cynthia
superseded an earlier pattern of land-use centering on short-term ungulate procurement. Summering
alpine villagers could not have accumulated essential winter stores and probably relied on fall pinyon
crops; trade in exotic items may have facilities access to productive groves. Alpine villages reflect
i increasing pressure on local resources linked to the spread of Numic-speaking peoples. Access to
European technology and population decline eliminated that pressure, terminating the alpine village
| pattern before it could be documented ethnographically.

ARIZONA
A crucial aspect of cultural adaptation is the explicit spatial relationship that exists between the
distribution of prehistoric populations and the various food resources available to them at any given
time. This paper presents the results of an examination of this spatial relationship in the Lower Zuni
River Valley of east-central Arizona. The analysis was conducted by reconstructing the environmental
conditions of the study area between AD 900 and AD 1400. The effects of the changing environmental!
conditions on the distribution of potential prehistoric food resources (specifically agricultural fields)
was reconstructed for different time periods. A model of settlement location was applied to the data
to produce expected settlement distributions for cach time period. The expected distributions are
then compared with the actual archaeological data to determine to what extent paleoenvironmental!
conditions impacted prehistoric settlement locations.

The Cambridge University Archaeological Expedition to Iran (1969), led by the late Professor C.M.B.

Work on the results of the excavation was undertaken by the author. The lithic assemblage has been
classified as Mousterian, perhaps even “Zagros Mousterian’’. The supporting palynological evidence
suggests an hitherto unknown interstadial period in the region at about 60—70,000 B.P. This paper

assemblage with other similar sites in the region.

Variation is seen at the broad regional level between the north, central and south coast and between

In contrast to other classes of artifacts, groundstone tools have received relatively little attention
from Mesoamerican archaeologists. Yet, these unglamorous tools are important components in many
different kinds of production activities, and, therefore, the study of these tools should provide helpful
data with which to examine issues involving craft production and the organization ot prehistoric
economies. At Otumba, groundstone tools were manufactured from locally available materials and
subsequently used in the production of food, cloth, and other goods.

In small-scale societies, ritual feasts are often an important arena for status competition and social

samples from mound and village contexts at the prehistoric Lubbub Creek site in Alabama are
compared. There are no significant differences in the proportions of decorated types or vessel shapes.
However, the mound has a more restricted range of vessel sizes and mound vessels are significantly
larger than village vessels. These results suggest that mound activities included large-group feasts
and perhaps storage.

{64] CIVIC SELF-DEFINITION IN THE AZTEC WORLD

Throughout Mesoamerica in the several hundred years before and after the Spanish invasion, Indian

termed lienzos. These maps or diagrams of a community and its communal lands functioned in the
Colonial period as land titles. This paper argues that, more importantly, the lienzos served to convey
community identity in space and time, locating a community centrally in a conceptualized geography
and establishing it temporally within a deep historical continuum.

[25] DIVERGENT EVOLUTION ON THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN (FUEGO-PATAGONIA)?

The Strait of Magellan, which today separates Patagonia from Tierra del Fuego, is a relatively recent
phenomenon, dated approximately 8,000 yrs. B.P. When the connection between the Atlantic and
Pacific oceans was instaured, human populations with a terrestrial adaptation were already inhabiting
the region, and segments of those populations became isolated on Tierra del Fuego, where they were
exposed to different sets of selective pressures. This situation may account for differences in mobility,
hunting strategics, and technology observed historically in groups from Fuego-Patagonia. Recently
excavated materials are revised under this new framework, in order to assess the case for divergent
evolution.

visibility and preservation in accounting for differences in Neolithic site density in the region. Thus,
along with cases from the Americas and elsewhere, research on the central plains of eastern China
emphasizes the need to understand depositional regimes before attempting to construct models of
prehistoric settlement patterns.

they have done so without sufficient caution. Greater chemical variability exists among some subunits
than recognized, and specimen size has been found to cause a dispersive influence over quantitative
output. XRF methods generally are of good quality, but they are not equal to powdered-specimen
analyses. XRF research must be evaluated in light of those technical limitations.

\63] STABLE CARBON ISOTOPES AND HUMAN DIET IN TRANS-PECOS TEXAS

The distribution of d13C values from human remains in Trans-Pecos Texas demonstrate two dietary
populations. d13C values from one well defined population reflect the heavy use of C4 or CAM plants,
and the second group depended more heavily on C3 plants but in varying quantities. However, detailed
paleodietary studies in the region have identified only a single adaptation specializing in CAM plant
exploitation. The anomalous carbon isotope ratios force a reconsideration of hunter-forager territorial
models proposed for the Lower Pecos region, and highlight the need to conduct more research on

[16] THE PASSAGE OF ARMS: VOTIVE DEPOSITS AS AN INDEX OF POLITICAL CHANGE
The destruction of wealth is one of those features of prehistoric Europe that have a very long history,
Sacrifices and votive offerings, often associated with watery locations, took place over at least 4000
years, but the appearance of continuity is only superficial as these practices were constantly modified
tw suit the political circumstances of the time. That is why the changing nature of votive offerings
can provide valuable indications of broader social processes, This paper illustrates this by considering
two important transitions that took place in later European prehistory; the change from bronze to
iran and the development of a market economy among native societies under the influence of Rome.

ADAPTATIONS IN THE AFAR RIFT OF ETHIOPIA
This paper outlines a predictive model of how prehistoric hunter/gatherer populations of the

The subject matter (imagery) of prehistoric visual arts of the American southwest is examined from

by context but images are only one of many factors contributing to the physical qualities of made
objects. Others include technology, media, social context, and artistic decisions which create formal
modes of organization. Each factor is potentially independent of all others and must be interpreted if
analysis of artistic content is to go beyond the simple naming of images.

[86] LATER PLEISTOCENE FISHING ECONOMIES OF CENTRAL AFRICA

Recent discoveries in the Semliki Valley of eastern Zaire have indicated that fishing was an
important component of human economic behavior there during much of the Later Pleistocene.

Faunal remains from four excavated sites attest to a varicty of fishing strategies, as well as to the

early presence of sophisticated fishing technology (bone harpoons) in a Middle Stone Age context. In

the Old World, lacustrine adaptations have often been considered as terminal Pleistocene/Holocene

lifeways which allowed more sedentary settlement patterns and were thus direct precursors of neo-

lithic economies. The Semliki evidence suggests instead that lacustrine adaptations have a much

older history and may have been important in the ongin and spread of anatomically modern human.

reanalysis of the grave lots. The identification of time sensitive artifacts has clarified the structure of
the domain of disposal of the dead. This advance in understanding has brought to light hitherto hidden
cultural and historical complexities. From this analysis and other sources of information, it appears
that (1) the site shifted direction of dominant cultural interaction twice in its history, and (2) the
artifact-rich graves of the Spiro Phase owe their mass of wealth to grave robbery of earlier phases.

64] THE LIP PLUGS OF XALTOCAN: SYMBOLS IN ACTION AND SYMBOLS IN PRACTICE

Fifty-five obsidian lip plugs were recovered from Middle and Late Postclassic contexts at Xaltocan,
Mexico. Ethnohistorical documents suggest that obsidian lip plugs served as ethnic markers distin-
guishing the Otomi from other ethnic groups in the Valley of Mexico. Xaltocan’s lip plugs are analyzed
within the paradigms of Marxist archaeology and contextual archaeology. Several issues are examined.
What archacological evidence would enable us to identify these lip plugs as ethnic markers in the
absence of documentary evidence? How can we establish their meaning? How can we establish their
function? How does this relate to broader issues of social transformation?

[)6] THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MAJOR te IN IRON AGE SOCIETY

Although large fortified settlements appeared in Temperate Europe towards the end of the Bronze
Age, they attained the status of capitals of civitates very gradually. Some show clear evidence of
intemal planning, but lack indications of public buildings, The emergence of Hallstatt-period citadels
seems to have derived from the power of individual aristocrats. Contrastingly, political power in
Celtic Italy was retained by a rural-based upper class. wih agricultural stores and burgeoning artisanal
sectors enclosed by monumental walls of traditional type, oppida were the first centers to witness
power struggles amongst aristocrats, tyrants, entrepreneurs, and representatives of the new political
order.

05] LATE ARCHAIC EXPANSION LN THE UPPER GLEN CANYON REGION,
SOUTHEASTERN UTAH ‘

Recent survey and testing of open sites in the upper Glen Canyon area indicates a notable increase
sn occupation during the Late Archaic period. Paleoenvironmental research on the Colorado Plateau
and Great Basin, focused primarily on plant macrofossils, suggest that this increase may have been
unfluenced by more favorable conditions in upland areas, including the expansion of the pinyon zone.
14 hearth dates imply that a hunter-gatherer strategy persisted in the area as late as ca. AD 400,
substantially later than the adoption of agriculture in Anasazi areas to the south and east.

[73] ARCHITECTURE AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION AT WUPATKI PUEBLO

Wupatki Ruin is a 12th century pueblo located in the Wupatki Basin of northern Arizona. A
reanalysis of original excavation data from this site was performed to suggest the nature of social
organization present. The analysis uses architectural features to infer use of specific rooms. Interactive
variables include room size, story, location, number, and kind of wall openings, and floor features.
Three basic room functions are recognized: habitation, storage, and ceremonial. Population estimates
are suggested from room size, and household boundaries are determined by room use and wall
openings.

BUTCHERING PATTERNS

Package size differences in various prey species may determine different butchering tactics by
hunters and gatherers. These variable carcass reduction tactics are also influenced by season, group
size, transport, and storage contingencies, Patterns derived from observations of anatomical element
representation, butchering marks, and breakage patterns on Bison bison and Rangifer tarandus are
presented to demonstrate facets of differential processing according to prey size. Variability in butcher-
ing tactics can be demonstrated by analysis of materials from Great Plains Protohistoric and European
Upper Paleolithic sites and compared to ethnoarchaeological control situations.

[75] THE BIOLOGICAL CORRELATES OF CULTURAL ADAPTATION IN THE ARKANSAS

RIVER BASIN

A bioarchaeological synthesis, including $44 individuals representing the Woodland and Mississippi
periods, has been conducted in the Arkansas Basin. Bioarchaeological evidence indicates: 1. no skeletal
group before the Fort Coffee phase exhibits caries rates indicating maize agriculture; 2, upland
populations consistently show greater utilization of carbohydrates than lowland groups; 3. the fre-
quency of skeletal infections also fluctuates by geographic region. The patterning of subsistence-
related data and paleoepidemiological indicators shows consistent differentiation between upland and
lowland populations, suggesting that ecological variability had a profound impact on prehistoric
inhabitants of the Arkansas drainage.

‘ [07] UPLAND MODOC VILLAGE SITES ASSOCIATED WITH WETLANDS

Research near Gerber Reservoir, south-central Oregon, has concentrated on upland Modoc sites. A
transhumant pattern of movement from spring throughout fall is implied in the ethnographic litera-
ture, however, a pattern of logistic mobility from a strategic location seems more likely. Fifteen
village sites are clustered around an open basin that was an extensive wetland with small ponds
providing habitat for fish and wildlife. Bones of fish and of waterfowl, and freshwater mussel shells
have been recovered and show the use of wetland resources. The degree of sedentism was determined
by the nature and distribution of upland wetland resources and the logistical strategy.

[63] BARIUM AS A PALEODIETARY INDICATOR

Barium levels in bone, like strontium levels, reflect dietary inputs and indicate trophic level. Barium
in the terrestrial environment is approximately as abundant as strontium, but barium in seawater is
less than strontium by several orders of magnitude. Thus the ratio of barium to strontium in bone is
a sensitive indicator of the relative contributions of marine and terrestrial dietary components. Trace-
element data from hundreds of archaeological samples from more than a dozen sites confirm that this
dietary sensitivity is preserved in fossil bone.

(20] FACTORS INFLUENCING EARLY HOHOKAM VILLAGE FORMATION IN THE PHOENIX

BASIN, ARIZONA

Current models of early Hohokam settlement and village formation stress a protracted and gradual
transition from highly mobile, hunter-gatherer to sedentary, agrarian land-use systems, However,
mew evidence is emerging which suggests that the transition was quite rapid and that sizable villages
exhibiting internal segmentation and community integrative features were forming as early as A.D.
300. This paper reviews the new evidence and identifies a number of factors that may have influenced
the relatively abrupt appearance of sedentary farming communities in the riverine environments of
the Sonoran Desert.

[$1] THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE MARGINAL: QHE ZAGROS PALEOLITHIC

In recent years, work in cool-temperate latitudes has investigated the fragility of human presence
and highlighted the subtle interplay of factors influencing Paleolithic habitation and its viability in
environmentally unstable or extreme areas. These may be marginal (though productive, intermit-
tently) in the longer-term view, but are by no means peripheral for archaeologist. With evidence of
eecupation at high altitude (cf. Houmian ca. 2000m in tile Middle Paleolithic), Zagros prehistory was
a5 open to constraints and opportunities as were Tasmania, southern England, or the European Alps.
Does available evidence mirror events elsewhere, and what avenues of future research are suggested?

The Spanish conquest of Central America differed widely according to whether or not indigenous
societies were participants in the Mesoamerican cultural tradition, and whether the resources of a
given area were of economic interest to the Spaniards. These two factors are explored through a
comparison of the conquests of Guatemala and Costa Rica, two areas known to differ both ‘in
indigenous culture and economic attraction for the Spaniards. To aid the assessment of these two

This paper examines architectural variability within the residential platform/household groups at

quantity of several architectural features are monitored for their patterns of variation. A rank order
of labor investment is achieved, and a social status hierarchy is presented for the residential area of
Sayil (Terminal Classic A.D. 800-1000). This discussion is placed in the context of Maya land tenure
systems. It is argued that large, wealthy households were ‘first founder’ families in the Sayil valley
and thus could effectively control and monopolize land and other productive resources including
labor, for their own advantages.

The National Forests of New Mexico and Arizona have recently implemented a program of cultural

that will provide a wide range of opportunities for the public to gain an understanding and appreciation
aot only of archaeological resources but of the goals and relevance of archacology itself. Citing specific
examples, an argument is presented that interpretation should not be merely a resource management
exercise. Successful public interpretation is both dependent on the supportive of scientific investiga-
tions to identify and explain the events and processes that shaped the past.

{69} SOCIAL FACTORS IN THE MIDDLE TO LATE WOODLAND TRANSITION IN
WESTCENTRAL ILLINOIS
In westcental Illinois, the Middle to Late Woodland transition is marked by the disappearance of
elaborate mounds and regional exchange, expansion and homogenization of ceramic style zones, and
smaller housefloors and resource territories. Coevolutionary models suggest a process of “tribaliza-
tion”, not a “decline of Hopewell". Examination of diachronic settlement distributions of groups
aggregating in the Illinois Valley during the Middle Woodland period suggests that Hopewell and
Middle Woodland characteristics are the reflection of elite ‘lineage’ competition and interaction
during the aggregation. Their disappearance or modification reflects subsequent solidification of
regional kinship networks (‘‘tribalization’”’), which replaced the elite-based network(s).

Surface surveys and collections at Otumba (1987-1988) located barrio-like concentrations of debris
from figurine and lapidary workshops. Excavations in 1988 and 1989 explored a figurine and a
lapidary workshop, each within a domestic residence, Figurine production was associated with the
manufacture of minor clay artifacts (marbles, ae censers). Lapidary output included ecarspools,
and labrets, of local and imported obsidian and rock crystal, points and blades of obsidian and chert,
and lapidary tools of obsidian, chert and basalt. This wide range of products from household contexts
indicates a broad production strategy.
Charlton, Thomas H. (lowa) ‘
[50] ECONOMICS AND POLITICS: THE CASE OF AZTEC OTUMBA
Otumba reached its political and economic apogec during the Late Horizon (ca. 1400-1520). Archaeo-
logical evidence of these interrelated developments is found in the construction sequence within the
nucleated core of TA-80, the elaboration and intensification of floodwater irrigation in the middle
valley alluvial plain, the extent and volume of specialized craft production at TA-80 and immediately
adjacent sites (groundstone, obsidian core-blade production, fiber spinning, figurine molding, and
lapidary work), and the distribution of ceramics within Otumba and its dependent sites. These data
confirm a Late Horizon pattern of regional variability in city-state economic and political development
in the basin of Mexico.

[32] CLIMATIC COOLING AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLLECTOR STRATEGIES ON
COLUMBIA PLATEAU
Studies of adaptive strategies among ethnographic hunter-gatherers indicate that logistically
mobile, storage-based “collector” strategies characterize northern latitudes, whereas nonstoring, resi-
dentially mobile “forager” strategies typify warmer regions. Between 6000 and 3000 yr B.P. on the
Columbia Plateau a highly-residentially mobile foraging adaptation is replaced first by periodically-
sedentary foraging, then by archetypical, logistically-mobile, storage-based, collecting. Paleoecologi-
cal data is examined in detail for a possible climatic trigger, with special attention to the resource
productivity and seasonality. Results show that increasing moisture ca 5000 yr B.P. improved produc-
tivity of local food resources, then neoglacial cooling restricted resource accessibility, stimulating
reduced mobility and, finally, storage-based collector adaptations.

[26] INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
The Society for American Archaeology has become increasingly alarmed at the rate the archeological
resource base of this country is diminishing due to vandalism, looting and erosion. If we cannot
successfully combat this problem, we will be reduced to pursuing our profession from arm-chairs or
in museum basements. Since we are so few, it is imperative that we pursue Cooperative ventures with
other interested groups, or we will not be successful in saving the past for the benefit of future
archaeologists and the public. The plenary session's participants will discuss various perspectives on
developing successful coalitions with other organizations and the need for educating the American
public on the value of protecting our cultural heritage.

Excavations at the Wari site of Pikillacta have revealed six examples of a building type whose

which open onto a spacious courtyard. Upon a building’s completion, sumptuous offerings—including
human interments, copper objects, and Spondylus shells—were placed near its four rounded interior

of symbols are recognized: 1) personal symbols whose meaning may have been known only to their
owner, 2) symbols whose meaning was known to Hopewell lineages or clans; and 3) standardized
symbols whose meaning was known to all members of Hopewell society.

[29] THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTAL SPACE IN EARLY ANGLO-SAXON ENGLAND: THE
ZOOARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE

This paper will examine the use of environment by the early Anglo-Saxon (Sth-7th century A.D.)
settlers in eastern England. The Breckland region in East Anglia, which was heavily settled in early
Saxon times, included a range of environmental zones—river bottoms, terraces, slopes, and uplands—
which could be used for different subsistence activities. The analysis will be based primarily on
zooarchaeological data which provides evidence for use of the different environmental zones for
animal husbandry and hunting. The faunal data are drawn primarily from the extensive excavations
at the early Anglo-Saxon settlement distributions and these ecological zones will also be considered.

[02] PALYNOLOGICAL RESEARCH AT CERROS, BELIZE

Archaeological pollen samples collected from sealed midden deposits at Cerros, a Late preclassic
Maya community, were used to reconstruct vegetational history of the site, Quantitative studies
of present-day plant associations and modern pollen analog samples were used to calibrate the
archaeological pollen data. If the archaeological and modern pollen assemblages were similar in their
pollen composition and proportions, it was concluded that they were produced by similar types of
plant associations. The pollen data were also integrated with the Cerros archaeobotanical assemblage
to provide a more complete record of the inhabitants’ utilization of wild plants and culrgens.

[74] MODELING THE EVOLUTION OF NORTHWEST COAST ECONOMIC DECISION-

MAKING: A 9,000-YEAR COMPUTER SIMULATION ’

Using computer simulation techniques we model economic patterns over 9,000 years along the
southern Northwest Coast of North America. Three main points are considered: (1) exponential
human population growth, (2) reconstruction of resource characteristics and behaviors, and (3) human
economic decision-making patterns. We project an exponential population growth and estimate that
post-glacial coastal regions would become “packed” at a very low population level by 4,000 BP, when
resource overexploitation begins in these circumscribed territories. Prior to 4,000 BP, economic
decision-making emphasized low-cost aggregations of populations, following 4,000 BP, resource pres-
sures promoted secure-income goals. The archaeological phases/culture types associated with ethnic
shifts over the past 9,000 years are reconsidered as economic plateaus seperated by short periods of
rapid economic change.

[44] PROTOHISTORIC ANASAZI KIVA MURALS: VARIATION AS A REFLECTION OF
DIFFERING SOCIAL CONTEXTS
Kiva paintings recovered from several protohistoric Anasazi sites in Arizona and New Mexico
exhibit considerable iconographic variation. Analysis of depictions of life forms and artifacts in the
murals from the various sites shows a strong divergence in subject matter represented. Subjects
occurring repeatedly at one site are often absent at others, While variation may be attributed in part
to temporal change, iconographic differences in the paintings from contemporancous sites suggest
that kiva murals reflect the values of particular socio-economic-religious groups. Kiva mural art
flourished over a wide arca between 1300 and 1600, bur the inconsistent iconography suggests
development in response to local needs rather than a pan-Anasazi phenomenon.

[44] CONVERGING TRADITIONS: SALADO POLYCHROME CERAMICS IN SOUTHWESTERN
PREHISTORY
Found over most of the Greater Southwest in the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries, the Salado
polychromes were the most widespread pottery types manufactured in the Southwest. The reasons
for this widespread adoption of a single pottery technology and style are explored by examining over
800 whole vessels from 72 sites. In attempting to assess the meaning behind designs, associations
between motifs, their placement on the vessels, and the continuum from highly representational
forms to highly abstract forms are investigated. Contexts in which specific designs occur are also
_ evaluated. Ultimately, the uniformity of the designs found over this broad area suggests greater
information exchange and interaction in the late prehistoric period.

[16] A CRITIQUE OF CULTURAL EVOLUTIONIST APPROACHES TO RANKED SOCIETY,
WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO CELTIC POLITIES
The task of integrating the social structure, ecology, and political economy of Celtic society in the
half-century before the Roman conquest, while not new, is all the more demanding after nearly a
century of analysis by cultural evolutionists. By disassembling the fabric of societies into autonomous
units under the purview of specialists, these researchers have masked their fundamental connection.
Perhaps most damaging has been cultural evolutionists’ importation of mechanical models of social
stratification from engineering and business, effectively obviating the role of individuals. lronically,
such predominantly hierarchical models have been replaced in those fields by more flexible and
inherently more complex heterarchical structures. Static, hierarchical models embedded in the cul-
tural evolutionist rhetoric of chiefdom and state obscure the dynamic social relations among and
within Celtic polities for which written accounts and archaeology give us evidence. I offer a scheme
by which many of the shortcomings of current analyses may be avoided and integrative, heterarchical,
multi-scalar, processual models might be offered in their place.

[04] THE RETURN TO SALVAGE ARCHAEOLOGY

Historic preservation generally has replaced salvage archaeology for good reasons, but the process
is imperfect, and requires vigilant attention. Archaeology has suffered from the failure of historic
preservation programs to critically or effectively evaluate the premise that "archaeological data
recovery’ is equivalent to site preservation, or meets the data requirements of modern archaeological
research. Recent experiences in New York State suggest not only that significant archaeological sites
continue to be endangered, but data recovery may easily replicate the worst conditions of salvage
archacology, including insufficient lead time to complete fieldwork, and lack of accountability for
curation, research performance, or reporting.

Cobble strata at Neolithic ‘Ain Ghazal, Wadi Shu’eib, and Abu Thawwab suggest debris flows

preadaptation to agriculture, which together with summer rainfall, began in the Levant about 10,000

‘ BP. Population and wealth increased rapidly. But by about 8,000 B.P., summer rainfall ceased and
together with overgrazing and deforestation forced separation of herding and cropping lifeways,
reduction in wealth, and a shift of intensive agriculture to the river floodplains of Mesopotamia and

POLITIES

Settlement attributes are compared for two neighboring Late Classic Maya capitals, Tenam Rosario
and Ojo de Agua, to assess political centralization within their polities. Several measures of political
centralization are used: whether or not the capital is constituted as a political microcosm of its
hinterland, the degrees to which elite and commoner settlement are concentrated into the capital,
the degree to which settlement is drawn away from boundaries. Results suggest that political central-
ization was achieved in different ways for each polity, a pattern which is provisionally accounted for
by culture-historical factors.

that can be gained from sites that represent the consumer end of the tool production/exchange/use

from Colha-area cherts. Formal tools such as oval bifaces and stemmed macroblades were used as
axes and multi-purpose cutting implements, respectively. Fragments were recycled into tools for

evidence of their range of functional variability and technological innovation at a site down the line

with the segmentary construct, it suggests that they had segmentary structures and increased in
number and decreased in size through time as might be expected of a segmentary system under the
appropriate conditions. They also followed a developmental trajectory that can best be explained by
segmentary processes. Settlement patterns, ceramic spheres, and artistic traditions likewise point to
segimentary organization.

The catastrophic loss of 90 percent or more of local population in consequence of human disease

possibility of major depopulation in the 16th century is admitted. Interpretive approaches that depend

analyzed from each stand to defirie a regional climatic signal. Results of analyses provide a signature
for comparison with archaeological wood samples and identification of potential source areas.

[75] LOOK TO THE SOUTHERN HILLS; LATE PREHISTORIC RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
THE ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY AND OUACHITA MOUNTAINS OF ARKANSAS
Research at the famed Spiro Site and other settlements in the Arkansas River Valley in Oklahoma
sought relationships between this region and far flung cultural centers such as Caddo heartland in
the Red River Valley and paramount mound centers further east. Research on mound centers in the
Ozarks has addressed relationships between the Spiro area and the mountains to the north. Recent
information from the Ouachita Mountains southeast of Spiro, however, shows similarities between
these two areas in the late prehistoric period and suggests another direction, literally, for investigation
of the transformation and eventual decline of Arkansas Valley societies.

[22] AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE IN OMAN AND REGIONAL HUMAN
ADAPTATIONS
Archacological survey in the Ja‘alan region of Oman reveals past communities adapted to both
coastal and interior conditions, At different times these communities combined hunting-gathering,
maritime foraging, pastoralism and farming by seasonal schedules and/or group specialization and
exchange to structure a flexible adaptation to this arid landscape. These adaptive responses differen-
cially structured the region according to natural (topography, water, soils, vegetation, etc.) and cultural
(subsistence strategies, extralocal political forces, interregional exchange, etc.) conditions. This paper
presents a model of changing subsistence strategies and their regional articulation from the early
Holocene to recent times.

[31] SITUATING THE PRODUCTION AND EXCHANGE OF STONE TOOLS IN THE BRITISH
NEOLITHIC
The view that technology is more open to ‘ahistorical’ forms of analysis (because it is concerned
with the pragmatics of day-to-day existence) continues to be put forward despite recent suggestions
that it is precisely at these levels that some of the most basic categories of society may be reproduced.
These problems are approached via a discussion of the economics of stone axes during the Neolithic
in Britain. {t is possible to identify a series of spatial and temporal thresholds across which these
artifacts took quite different roles in social practices; they do not simply reflect the appearance and
spread of a particular subsistence regime.

[39] ARCHAEOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF VARIABILITY IN THE ECONOMIC ANATOMY
OF BISON BISON
Analyses of four modern bison carcasses provide data on variability in the relative yields of meat
and fat in this animal. These data suggest that age and sex play major roles in determining relative
yields, and that the differences are large enough to potentially influence hunter selection decisions.
These decisions are made at three levels before and after the kill. The relative yields of different herd
types, carcasses, and carcass units are important factors influencing selection. Three carcass unit
utility model types, based upon caloric yields of meat and/or fat, provide options for the analysis of
archaeological bone assemblages.

[74] PREHISTORIC AGRICULTURAL INTENSIFICATION: A PERSPECTIVE FROM THE
ANDEAN HIGHLANDS
Prehistoric raised field agriculture in the Americas is commonly considered to have developed as
a response to population pressure, as proposed in Boscrup’s model of agricultural intensification.
Archaeological survey and excavation provide evidence that raised field technology developed early
in the Lake Titicaca Basin of Peru (ca. 1000 BC) in the absence of population stress. Experimental
archaeological investigation based on the reconstruction and use of abandoned raised fields indicates
that this agriculture is very efficient. It is argued in this paper that raised field agriculture was an
early option chosen by wetland agriculturalists for the expansion of lacustrine-oriented economies.

[34] OVERVIEW OF NATIVE ALASKAN DISPERSAL IN THE NORTH PACIFIC
One by-product of the arrival of the Russian-Anferican Company to the North Pacific was the
forcible dispersal of a large number of skilled Alaskan hunters from the Aleutian Islands, Kodiak and
the Kenai Peninsula to the various outposts of the Company. These people were taken to places as
diverse as Baja California, the Channel Islands near Santa Barbara, the Farralones, Fort Ross, Southeast
Alaska, and the Kurile Islands north of Japan. Although normally used as hunters, they were often
involved in violent battle with peoples they encountered who objected to their apparent poaching.

We examine the use of linguistic and textual models for explaining material culture variability. As
we see it, there are three levels of explanation: material conditions, meaning, and agency. We suggest
that: 1) linguistic and textual models are primarily designed to get at meaning; 2) both mental
constructs and material conditions play an active role in creating material culture variability; 3) it is
through agency that these two realms are mediated and played out; 4) explanation at the level of
agency should be the ultimate objective of archaeology; and 5} this objective is best achieved through
coordinating analytical models and interpretations of both meaning and material conditions.

133] OBSIDIAN HYDRATION RATES AS A FUNCTION OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY
We have determined that the hydration rate of obsidian under surficial conditions is a function of
relative humidity (rH), Relative humidity measurements of soil at various sites, integrated over a one
wear time-span, show that the soil rH is approximately 100% at depths greater than about 10cm.
Obsidian samples that hydrated on the surface are exposed to a higher effective temperature than
those that were buried. However the effect on the rate of hydration of the lower rH of the surface
samples tends to compensate for the increased rate due to the higher temperature experienced by
these samples. This explains why surface samples seldom show thicker hydration than those buried
on the soil at the same site.

In recent years the Upper Paleolithic of Western Europe has ceased to be the center of the Late
Pleistocene world and has instead become a case study of apparently complex societies at its periphery.
But even here the regional evidence for settlement and adaptation is partial when compared with
either the Russian or North American Plains. The most striking features are the lack of sedentism
and systematic large scale procurement of herd animals. Without the evidence for winter villages and
bison jumps, the West European evidence poses interpretative difficulties when compared with these
other regions. These problems need to be considered before judgments are made about vicariant social
process which designates some chosen parts of the Paleolithic World as complex.

paleoenvironments, settlement and subsistence through the Late Quaternary and the early Holocene.
This paper evaluates the results from these highly contrasting areas and relates them to the broader
regional picture.

{01] STRATEGIES FOR SURVIVAL AMONG THE INDIANS OF COLONIAL SOCONUSCO
The Indians of colonial Soconusco were exposed to many of the same Spanish institutions and
policies that affected Indians throughout the Spanish colonies. As in other regions, population loss
was extremely high following the introduction of new diseases. Unlike the native populations of
many other areas, however, the Indians of colonial Soconusco produced cacao, a valuable world
market commodity, resulting in their development of unique adaptive strategies. In this paper I

[05] INVESTIGATION OF BASALTIC ASH RIDGE-AND-MOUND AGRICULTURAL FIELDS
DISCOVERED BY REMOTE SENSING IN NORTH-CENTRAL ARIZONA
During the 12th and 13th centuries A.D., the Sinagua of north-central Arizona both intensified and
diversified their agricultural production strategies. The extent to which this occurred is only now
becoming evident. Discovery of certain field systems has depended upon the remote sensing technique
of thermal infrared imaging. Most recently disclosed are large ridges and mounds of basaltic ash that
were created within areas from 2 km2 to 35 km2. These dry farming plots have no parallel in
ethnographic accounts from the southwest. Results from investigations of these field systems are
reported, and the use of single- and multi-band thermal infrared images for their identification is
discussed.

The transition from complex chiefdoms to the primitive state occurred later in Ireland than else-

province of Thomond, the historical sources allow the discrimination of the following levels of socio-

(55] CHALCOLITHIC FARMER-HERDERS IN THEIR ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT IN THE
NORTHERN NEGEV
Based on new studies, climatic conditions during the Chalcolithic Period in the Negev were
considerably different from today. Humid conditions were the result of rain and dust storms of
southern origin and were common in the fall and the spring. The calibrated dates for the sites are ca.
5,000-3,500 B.C. Archaeological evidence indicates that successful farming and herding communities
exploited the northern Negev, while the marginal belt, in the foothills, were used as pastures by
herders who were based in permanent small villages.

[14] SETTLEMENT PATTERNS AND THE SEASONAL USE %t PIT STRUCTURES
Ethnographic data from Siberia indicate that the use of both pit Structures and other kinds of houses
wary predictably. Specifically, pit structures are used instead of other habitations in instances where
the food on which a group depends is present in bulk quantities that must be quickly prepared and
stored. Pit structure use therefore depends in part on the composition of the environment in terms
of seasonally available food. The seasonality of food leads to seasogfality of pit structure use. These
conclusions are applied to prehistoric pit structure settlement patterns in southeastern Anzona, an
grea with large pit structure sites.

A shift toward specialized forms of domestic animal management has long been suggested as a
major economic trend for Neolithic Europe. This paper presents the results of analyses of 59 faunal
assemblages from early and late Neolithic contexts throughout central Europe. An investigation of
taxonomic diversity is combined with observations on the relative abundances of major taxa and their
age and sex profiles. Results of these faunal analyses confirm a trend toward the manipulation of
domestic animals for different economic purposes. This trend is related to a general intensification
of agricultural practices by the fourth millennium B.C.

religious pilgrimages, and so on) leads to local development and/or “‘transculturation,” while strong
interaction (e.g. warfare) leads to more rapid acculturation. This distinction will be examined in light
of interaction spheres in the historic and protohistoric Caribbean. Attention will be given to both
strong and weak interaction among aboriginal groups, aborigines and Europeans, and peoples of |

include Sacramento perch, tule perch, hitch, stickleback and prickly sculpin. These remains indicate
the exploitation of slow-moving marshy waters among vegetation much like that which still exists
near the site today. Today, Elkhorn Slough in Monterey County, California, is a marine estuary, Most
of the fish remains recovered during excavation of an archaeological site there (CA-Mnt-229) are from
freshwater species which inhabit slow moving, marshy waters. These results help document the local

sedimentological analyses of the deposits essentially provide descriptive information, the palacocli-

lack of climatic influence on depositional and post-depositional processes, or the effect of non-climatic
factors, such as anthropogenic and biogenic sedimentation and transformation of the deposits.

in La Mixtequilla were commonly occupied over very long periods of time, and were large enough to
accommodate several structures. A major force in the formation of domestic mounds was the periodic
destruction of wattle and daub houses, the primary residential construction type. Mounds grew
through a combination of deliberate buildup and expansion using refuse and fill, and accretion due to
the decomposition of daub houses and the erosion of artifacts.

Although the late pre-Roman Iron Age in NW Europe was 4 period of obvious archaeological

processes must be isolated and their particular causation specified, and greater emphasis placed on

examines several models for the appearance of pottery in the prehistoric economies of the Eastern
Woodlands of North America. These models posit a range of causal factors, including changes in
subsistence resources, storage, food preparation, and water use. The archaeological data traditionally
used to support these models are evaluated, as are those for changes in the organization of procurement
. and production, settlement patterning, etc., which have been postulated as consequences of applying
the new technology.

[32] PREHISTORIC CULTURAL COMPLEXITY AND CORPORATE GROUPS ALONG THE
MIDFRASER RIVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA
The Lillooet locality along the Fraser River in Interior British Columbia witnessed a remarkable
development of cultural complexity from 2,000—1,000 B.P. Ideal salmon procurement and preservation
conditions as well as geographic constraints on trade routes contributed to the unusual size of villages,
residential corporate groups, and socioeconomic differentiation, High status items were similar in
the Interior Plateau of British Columbia and Washington and may represent selective but widespread
interaction between high-ranking individuals from different communities. This exchange pattern fits
the concept of an interactions sphere and can be termed the Interior Plateau Interaction Sphere.

[58] SYMBOLIC SHELTERS: DOMESTIC AND RITUAL ARCHITECTURE IN THE AMERICAN
SOUTHWEST

Architecture creates both paces and barriers and thus can unite as well as divide social groups. The
relationship between architecture, social integration, and ritual is examined in Pueblo societies of
the North American Southwest. Ethnographic kivas provide shelter and symbolic context for ritual
and provide focus for social groups. In contrast, domestic architecture often divides social groups.

Prehistoric pit structures were both ritual and domestic places, and interpretations of these structures

as kivas is the subject of recent debate. This problem is addressed by considering the role of pit

structures in social integration, using data from the northern Southwest.

ORGANIZATION AND THE SYMBOLIC DIMENSIONS OF THE LUO HOMESTEAD

The spatial organization of Luo settlements is determined by strict ritual regulations and a shared

layouts of homesteads, however, evince considerable variation. This apparent inconsistency is
explained by the fact that settlements are a dynamic form of material culture in continual transforma-

[55] SETTLEMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE DURING THE EARLY BRONZE AND IRON
AGES IN THE BEER-SHEBA VALLEY, ISRAEL
Semi-arid climatic conditions of the Beer-sheba Valley prevented the erection of permanent settle-

population are found only during two phases: Early Bronze Age fl (ca. 2900-2600 B.C.E.) and Iron Age
I (ca. 1200-1000 B.C-E.). It is argued that the main explanation of this phenomenon is the possibility,
during these short periods, of carrying out dry-farming, due to milder climatic conditions. This claim
is supported by the long gaps in sedentary occupation in the Valley, by the civilian-agriculturalist
character of the settlements (house plans and storage facilities), and by the paleobotanical and zooar-
chaeological data.

[23] MESOAMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY AND THE CHICAGO WORLD'S FAIR
The World’s Columbian Exposition of 1893 in Chicago not only celebrated four centuries of indus-

comparison, the occasion also aroused interest in aboriginal peoples throughout the Americas, thereby
presenting an opportunity to display the current status of anthropological and archaeological knowl-

131] THE ROLE OF INTERPRETIVE PREHISTORY
Most post-processual archaeology has refrained from fully interpretive accounts; they continue to
rely heavily on externally imposed theories and guidelines, broader schemes. The chanced data
eemain secondary to a wider strategic, theoretical or political purpose. As a result post-processual
archacologies have rarely broken out of the privileged institutional framework within which they
work and their theoretical posturing has revitalized older structures of domination. An interpretive
prehistory, as opposed to an anthropological archaeology, is defined, and its potential for transforming
the relations of production of academic knowledge is discussed. The importance of debate through
rather than over the data is emphasized.

(05) ARCHAIC MOBILITY STRATEGIES IN NORTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO:

IMPLICATIONS FOR THE ADOPTION OF AGRICULTURE

Although several useful models have been developed to describe Archaic settlement systems in
northwestern New Mexico, research has been hampered by a lack of data from upland settings and
by the synchronic focus inherent in ecological studies. In this paper, ethnographic data on the size of
hunter-gatherer annual ranges are compared with the distribution of nonlocal lithic materials at
Archaic sites in the San Juan Basin to provide a chronologically-sensitive index of regional population
movements. When this information and chronometric indices of occupational intensity are examined,
changes in mobility strategies are evident in response to fluctuating environm ental conditions,
demographic pressure, and to the introduction of cultigens.

[07] THE ROLE OF LAKE EDGE RESOURCES IN HUNTER-GATHERER SUBSISTENCE:
FAUNAL EVIDENCE FROM THE EASTERN GREAT BASIN
Lacustral systems in the Great Basin and elsewhere were attractive to hunter-gatherers due to the

ring the edge of the lake, suggesting the importance of these wetland resources to prehistoric peoples.
This paper presents faunal evidence from test excavations at several of these sites. In addition to

[86] LAKESIDE ADAPTATIONS IN THE SOUTH GERMAN MESOLITHIC
The role of lakes in human adaptations in temperate and boreal forests is marked by pronounced
variability. This variability, together with the dynamic depositional environments of lake edges,
complicates archaeological interpretations of prehistoric lacustrine adaptations. Recent work on the
Paleolithic and Mesolithic of the Federsee, a south German lake, will] be used to explore this vanability
and to place this lake into the broader context of late- and postglacial subsistence and settlement |
patterns in this area.

[09] THE INTERFACE OF FORMATIVE CERAMIC TRADITIONS IN HONDURAS: THE
PERSPECTIVE FROM YARUMELA
Early Honduran ceramics, viewed from the perspective of Yarumela, offer an opportunity for the
analysis of an interface amongst various New World Formative ceramic traditions. Three components
are especially prominent in this interface: 1} a local stone-vessel carving tradition, revealing the
indigenous origin of the famed Ulua carved marble bowls and vases of the Late Classic; 2) the intrusion
of an ultimately South American Tropical Forest derived ceramic tradition; and 3) Mesoamerican
influences from the Olmec and Tilatilco style ceramic complexes.

[71] FOOD AS METAPHOR IN THE FOOD-SYSTEMS OF THREE MISSISSIPPIAN CULTURES
The plant remains recovered from archacological sites reflect not only prehistoric diet but food-
systems enmeshing matenial, social, and religious dimensions. For the Mississippian period of the
Eastern Woodlands, paleoethnobotanical analyses are delineating areal differences in aspects of the
food systems not attributable to environmental constraints. The pattern of the Cahokia area, for
example, exhibits conservatism in the crops grown, while the Ohio Valley Fort Ancient people
adopted a mode of eating quite different from their predecessors. | examine the food-systems of three
Mississippian cultural areas: Cahokia, Moundville, and the Ohio Valley. I consider the variation in
ways of eating in relation to cultural and political differences, as well as similarities that reflect
“Mississippian” values shared by the people of the three cultural areas.

|31] TECHNICAL AND SOCIAL SYSTEMS IN ENGLAND: 1400-1700 AD
{t is argued that there is no such thing as ‘technology’; rather, technical systems are one aspect of
the social structure and cultural logic of a society. This is Ulustrated by considering timber-framed
architecture in England, AD 1400-1700. The craft tradition both transforms itself and weakens
through time, as distinctions between the surface and essence of a building, its construction and the
meanings it carries, and the craft process and final product develop. These changes are closely related
to changes in spatial organization and factors affecting changing contemporary views of the house
and household, such as the rise of individualism and a capitalist world view.

[33] SYMBOLIC AND SPATIAL ASPECTS OF PREHISTORIC IRISH PETROGLYPHS
Irish petroglyph sites (c. 2500-1500 b,c.) show a different distribution pattern from other contempo-
rary ritual sites, particularly burials. Variation in contemporary bufial types can be used to indicate
regional levels of cultural affiliation. Irish petroglyphs show no such regional groupings, instead
indicating a level of uniformity which is “pan-Irish” in extent. Petroglyphs thus cross these regional
boundaries, providing a level of cultural affiliation which encompasses them. Such a pan-Irish level
of affiliation has not been argued for this period, and may have facilitated the movement of people
across local cultural boundaries.

There is a qualitative gap between what we archaeologists do and what the public thinks we do.
Many archaeologists fail to recognize that the public is the primary audience to which we should be
responsible. Thus, our profession is little more than a small, esoteric, self-perpetuating community
of scholars with virtually no contact with or care about its true constituency. We convince ourselves
that what we do is somehow anthropologically relevant and thus need not be justified in any other
context. In order to save the past for the future, we must save it for someone other than ourselves.

] MIDDEN EXCAVATIONS AT PIKILLACTA, PERU, 1989
Excavations were conducted in a midden located outside one of the main perimeter walls of the
site of Pikillacta. Artifacts recovered include locally manufactured ceramics in both Wari and non-
Wari styles and probable imported ceramics. The excavations also revealed living flours and terraces.
Some of this material predates the major structures and may have been left by construction crews.
Analysis of the artifacts recovered should help to date the construction of the site more precisely. It
should also yield information on interaction between regions of Peru at the time of the Wari empire
and on the impact of the Wari occupation on the local population.

Arkansas River drainage centers to the southwest. House wall trench architecture, a Huntsville
diagnostic, is also noted at Spiro in the Arkansas drainage but not at Loftin, downstream from
Huntsville. Within the context of the two drainage systems, these centers may represent one of
two alternative settlement strategies by complex agrarian societies: (1) progressive, northeastward

of individual communities during Harlan and subsequent Spiro phases.

The Northern Caribbean is a geopolitical region centered in Hispaniola and encompassing a Jamai-

expansion and concurrent development of chiefdoms by the Tainos. Taino chiefdoms employed
the principles of matrilineal descent and avunculocal residence. Archaeological and ethnohistoric
evidence for the Bahamas reveals differences in the scale of interaction along networks employed in
the sociopolitical manipulation of kinship: warfare, marriage, ceremonial reciprocity, and commercial
transactions. It is argued that the network emphasized reflects differences in sociopolitical integration
and in the degree of autonomy from the geopolitical core.

This paper provides an overview of current research on the prehistoric use of wetlands in the Great

drawn from evolutionary ecology, current research focuses on the effect wetlands have on settlement
strategies and storage strategies; in particular, the use of wetlands in a desert environment alters
current understanding of the origin of sedentism among hunter-gatherers. This paper argues that

[69] THE TIMING AND CONSEQUENCES OF THE INTRODUCTION OF MAIZE:
AGRICULTURE IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
Archaeologist in the Lower Mississippi Valley have generally assumed that corn, beans, and squash
provided the subsistence stability and the surpluses necessary for the development of the complex,
stratified polities which exist during the Coles Creck period. Recent research indicates that maize
was probably not an important part of the diet until after this period. Therefore, the introduction of
maize-based agriculture had little impact on the formation of chiefdoms in Coles Creek culture. In
this regard Coles Creek is very different from early Mississippian; it is a distinct adaptation to the
highly productive environment of the Lower Mississippi Valley.

[79] A SURVEY OF PREHISTORIC LITHIC RESOURCE PROCUREMENT AREAS ALONG THE
MIDDLE SAN JUAN RIVER IN SOUTHEAST UTAH
For a number of years, archaeologists have noted the presence of distinctive chert, siltstone, and
quartzite lithic raw materials on sites in the four corners area. Recent survey work in the vicinity of
Aneth, Utah has documented prehistoric quarry sites in association with outcrops of the Morrison
and Burro Canyon geologic formations. This paper presents a survey of these sites with an emphasis
on procurement, extraction, and reduction strategies. Raw material types and context in geologic
formations are documented. Settlement patterns in relation to quarry locales are described and
possible explanations for the observed patterning are presented.

[01] CHANGE FOR SURVIVAL; THE CASE OF 16TH CENTURY INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS
OF NORTHEAST AND MIDEAST HONDURAS
The systematic conquest and colonizanon of Northeast and Mideast Honduras began in 1525 with
the Spanish colonial foundation of Trujillo. Attempts to conquer and subdue the native inhabitants
focused on the valleys of El Aguan, Agalteca, and Olancho, lasting until 1533. During these eight
years a series of factors contributed to critical changes in the indigenous sociopolitical structure.
Among these changes, population decline and modifications in the settlement pattern stand out. This
examination attempts to reconstruct the scenario in which these indigenous societies adopted an
effective survival strategy. However, this new, less cohesive strategy exposed the indigenous popula-
tion to “‘ladinization” and mestizaje.

[59] ANASAZI HUNTING STRATEGIES AS SEEN THROUGH PROJECTILE POINT
DISTRIBUTIONS
Few items of prehistoric Southwestern technology are as widely distributed as the business end of
the hunting kit, the stone projectile point. Primarily used as a weapon, complete and broken projectile
points occur as surface finds, in trash deposits, on feature and structure floors, and as cached goods.
Here we consider the pathways that distribute projectile points among these various archaeological
recovery contexts. An integrated model of hunting behavior resulting in projectile point use, discard,
and loss is used to interpret the distribution of projectile points from several regional research projects.

[80] CLIMATIC VARIABILITY AND POPULATION GROWTH AMONG THE VIRGIN
BRANCH ANASAZI
The prehistory of the northwestern region of the American Southwest is characterized by population
growth, agricultural intensification and specialization, sedentism, increased settlement aggregation,
, Lecount, Lisa and Melissa Hagstrum 117
and abandonment. Recent dendroclimatic research reveals that two major drought episodes, A.D.
1120 to 1150, contributed to significant changes in the adaptive strategies of the Anasazi. The first
event forced several adaptive shifts while the second caused regional abandonments. An extremely
favorable climatic interval, A.D. 1020 to 1110, may have allowed spring floodplain farming and
summer rainfall agriculture. This double cropping strategy may have promoted exponential popula-
tion growth. Our explanatory framework suggest that the preconditions of population growth and
increased dependence on agriculture set the various levels of sensitivity to extreme climatic events
and these were the three primary factors operating on the selective behavior of the Anasazi.

[34] MASSACRE OF THE MEDVEDEV PROMYSHLENNIEKS, 1764 AD
Discovery of the Russian victims of an Aleut massacre in the Chaluka village midden, Umnak

Kodiak where he had risked the same fate. Finding the skeletons and artifacts of Medvedev permits
examination of both sides of the dispute between Russian fur traders and the Aleut kayak hunters
who were required to hunt for them. The archaeological evidence confirms the Aleut oral tradition
and historical accounts. Basic contrast between the Russian and the Aleut ecosystem management

[05] EVIDENCE FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF CORN AND THE BOW AND ARROW INTO
NORTHEASTERN NEW MEXICO
Survey and excavations in Cerrososo Canyon near Cimmaron, New Mexico provided evidence that
the bow and arrow, corn and circular stone architecture were all introduced into Northeastern New
Mexico about A.D. 500. Radiocarbon dates in the A.D. 500’s were recovered from non-ceramic sites
with corn and stone architecture. Projectile points from these sites are small comer-notched arrow
points that provided obsidian hydration dates in the A.D. 500’s. Other Sites produced radiocarbon
dates in the A.D. 400’s and larger comer-notched atlatl dart points which provided obsidian hydration
dates in the A.D. 400s.

floral content of more than 200 flotation and macrofossil samples have been analyzed from households
of varying socioeconomic status and depositional history (ranging from Middle Preclassic circa 900

[32] WITH APOLOGIES TO V. GORDON CHILDE: NEW LIGHT ON THE MOST ANCIENT
PLATEAU
The Windust Phase, the Phillipi Phase, and related components represent a wide-spread foraging
people who occupied the southern Plateau from ca. 11,000 to 8000 yr B.P. The artifact inventory
from this period is well enough known that projectile point style and technology are sufficient for
assemblage assignment. On this basis, artifacts in the Bergen collection from Atlatl Valley near the
Dalles of the Columbia River represent Windust-Phillipi era burials containing stemmed projectile
points and oversized, elaborate “atlatl weights” as grave goods, These grave goods represent an artifact
elaboration found in many early Plateau assemblages, but one wonders why the most extreme
manifestation of this elaboration, even 9000 to 10,000 yr B.P., was at the Dalles.

Data from eight Late Postclassic sites in the Coatlan del Rio Valley of western Morelos are used to
assess hypotheses about economic organization in rural Aztec tribute provinces. Spatial analyses of
intensive, systematic surface collections define over 100 refuse disposal areas representing various
size household groups and extramural workshops distributed throughout the region. Quantitative
analyses of ceramic and lithic assemblages suggest a complex system of functional organization,
production, and consumption. Data from the Coatlan del Rio Valley, combined with results from
other recent Aztec period studies, indicate simple normative models of rural Aztec economic organiza-

[06] COMPETITION TO CONSOLIDATION: THE COPPER TO BRONZE AGE TRANSITION IN

The marked shifts in settlement and burial patterns, ceramic technology, and artifact variability
that characterize the Copper to Bronze Age transition in Portugal have traditionally been interpreted
as culturally ‘regressive’. It can be argued, however, that this idea had as much to do with the ayailable
data as the ideological context in which archaeological research in Portugal was carried out, A’recent
investigation of subsistence and settlement patterns with a reassessment of the earlier data suggests
that the Bronze Age was, in fact, a period of regional integration assgciated with increased social
complexity, and a formative stage in the development of later Iron Age chiefdoms.

THE HOHOKAM WHOLE VESSEL STUDY

An analysis of an assemblage of prehistoric whole vessels reveals insights into the general study of
vessel function and the possible uses of prehistoric vessels. Simple ratios of measurements are used
to divide vessels into broad functional groups which were found to heavily overlap each other. Such
overlap may suggest vessels were engineered to serve multiple rather than single functions. Other
attributes, including upper vessel shape, aperture, and traces of use-wear are used to suggest that
many Red-on-buff vessels were used to store and transport liquids, Finally, functions for assemblages
of decorated vessels are proposed and compared at a regional scale to suggest mechanisms of exchange.

{22} A PRELIMINARY LITHIC ANALYSIS OF EARLY AND MIDDLE BRONZE AGE

INDUSTRIES FROM TWO VILLAGE SITES IN THE LEVANT

Bronze Age village life during the late third to early second millennia B.C. in the Levant has been
characterized by a change from non-sedentary pastoralism to urban sedentary agriculture. Recent
research, however, suggests similar economic activities and sedentism occurred throughout this
period concurrent with marked changes in ceramics and settlement patterns. The lithic industries
from the sites of Tell el-Hayyat and Tell Abu en-Ni’aj, Jordan indicate a change from blade industries
to an ad hoc flake technology. The disappearance of blades may result from changes in the organization
of technology with the advent of urbanism.

tite is least soluble) to 13.0. Both bones and solutions were subjected to analysis to examine changes |

in elemental concentrations. Bone preservation is influenced by the dissolution of hydroxyapatite at

pH measurements above 7.9,

Settled communities are concentrated along the Muddy and Virgin Rivers at the eastern edge of the

make it unlikely that Anasazi food procurement groups exploited locales 30 km and more from
habitation sites. Either a biseasonal pattern of habitation or attempts to colonize adjacent areas still
point to a restricted Anasazi presence in the desert. Alternatively, the distribution of sherds may

There were many episodes of overt Indian resistance in the colonial Audiencia of Guatemala. The

Excavations at El Duende, a small, Late Classic mound group in the foothills of the Copan Valley,
Honduras, have revealed obsidian densities as high as 8900 gms/m3 over much of the site. Evaluation
of the obsidian, other artifacts from the site, and the architectural remains indicate that El Duende
served as a specialized workshop providing commodities for exchange with the occupants of the
Copan Valley. Site location, artifact assemblages, and architectural quality demonstrate the low
socioeconomic status of El] Duende’s occupants. Specialized production at El Duende is interpreted

as a means of supplementing marginal agricultural production through commodity exchange.

[27] REFLECTIONS ON THE ETHICS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATION

A number of rather complex issues involving ethics in archaeological excavation have been pre-
viously addressed by Lipe (1974) and Plog (1984). Both authors have rightly stressed a need for
justification of excavation within the framework of conservation archaeology, a basic tenet being the
assumption that it is both feasible and desirable to conserve and protect archaeological sites for the
future. The relative merits of research needs and cata ethic approach to excavation are herein
weighed against the realities of site loss, and the unfortunate necessity and prospects of “resaving”’
archacological sites indefinitely into the future. Other ethical considerations that to some degree
transcend the single-mindedness of archaeological research, such as the archaeologist’s responsibilit-
ies to landowners and the public-at-large, are also addresseg.

the early to late portions of the Pueblo fl period (ca. AD 950 to 1150). Examination of the architectural
characteristics suggest that classes of pitstructures can be identified on the basis of the complexity
of associated architectural features (e.g., the presence or absence of a southern recess, pilasters, bench,
floor vaults, and miscellaneous other features), In addition, variability in pitstructure morphology is
identified between the early and late Pueblo II periods.

[46] INTERDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH: THE CRITICAL EDGE
Advantages and hazards of interdisciplinary research are exemplified, drawing from the history of
American archaeology and my own experiences. Interdisciplinary research can be successful in CRM
settings provided that managers, archaeologists, and administrators understand and are committed
to the total program, including publication and curation. Interdisciplinary research in university
settings requires leadership, stable funding, and institutional support, but participation in long-term
projects can be disadvantageous to young scholars who must demonstrate productivity in the form
of multiple publications. We should better inform our university colleagues, administrators, and the
general public about the advantages of interdisciplinary research.

[54] “FOLSOM-MIDLAND" SITES OF THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS
Past and recent investigations conducted in the Southern High Plains have revealed the existance
of cight Folsom-Midland sites. The majority of these have been found eroding from Holocene dunes
associated with Pleistocene playas. Asa result, we are faced with serious limitations in our understand-
ing of the temporal and spatial relationsip of Folsom-Midland assemblages, However, the distribution
of sites and analysis done on the Midland type site collection yield some insights into the age and
association of these two types. Notably, this preliminary research does not provide any conclusive
evidence distinguishing Folsom and Midland as two separate complexes.

[66] DOCUMENTATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIAL AT THE GETTY CENTER
The photographic archive of the Getty Center maintains visual collections in support of advanced
study in a broad range of cultural areas with particular focus on the western European tradition
and special interest in classical archaeology. The supporting database system, which records basic
descriptive information for the archaeological objects and monuments, is essential to the management
of the large collection of images, and greatly facilitates scholarly access to these materials. As the
database grows, and the possibilities for data sharing and exchange increase, we face scrious questions
about our control of the dissemination and ultimate use of our information.

ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT
The contribution to the project of the archaeometric techniques discussed in previous papers in the

[74] DIETARY CHANGE IN THE UPLAND SOUTHWEST: THE COMING OF AGRICULTURE
From AD 200-1270, subsistence at Cedar Mesa, Utah, was based on rainfall! dry-farming of maize,
with other domesticates and wild resources serving as supplements. This paper shows that, during
the period AD 200-1270, this adaptation was widespread on the Colorado Plateau, even though
another form of agriculture, flood-water farming, was being practiced elsewhere contemporaneously
and had been practiced earlier at Cedar Mesa. These twon agricultural adaptations are also contrasted
with late plateau Archaic subsistence patterns. Evidence for an Archaic-Anasazi transition and for a
San Pedro migration to explain the development of agriculture in the western Colorado Plateau will
be examined.

[59] FACTORS CONDITIONING VARIATION IN SITE AREA IN THE AMERICAN
SOUTHWEST
; Site area, the distance over which artifacts are dispersed, plays a critical role in interpretive schemes
which use survey data. Large sites, thought to result from population aggregation, are the focus of
interpretation, with smaller sites and facilities being peripheral. Yet, the factors which cause differ-
efices in site area are not understood. While population differences influence site area, several factors,
imeluding the nature of the environment and the overall adaptation, are also involved. Comparisons
: trom several well surveyed environments in the Southwest demonstrate marked differences in site
area. Factors which may account for these differences are considered.

[59] AGRICULTURAL SITES IN AN EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT
The regional distribution and diversity of agricultural features and facilities is commonly used to
characterize functional-adaptational systems but such analyses frequently provide only a description
; of the system in terms of modal patterns. When agricultural systems are observed to have changed,
2 monocausal explanation is usually offered. Descriptions of how an agricultural system functioned
or changed does not help us understand why the system came to assume its configuration. However,
by giving increased attention to the variability within an agricultural system, there is opportunity to
measure the most effective response through time and isolate the selective processes that led to new
patterns. Data from northem New mexico is viewed in this framework.

The “combatting the problem” workshop dealt with four basic issues in archaeological resource
protection: site vulnerability to looting and vandalism; federal laws and regulations protecting archaco-

Longitudinal models of household development are discussed with particular attention to the social

size are symptomatic of a socially heterogeneous unit with a long occupation history. A household
developmental growth model is applied to the Terminal Classic Maya settlement data trom Sayil,
Yucatan. Different sectors of the city are found to yield residential clusters of comparable size and
architectural elaboration and may represent “neighborhoods” in different developmental phases.

Interpreting the past in the coastal forests of the Alaska Region presents unique opportunities as
well as challenges. The Tongas and Chugach National Forests have implemented educational outreach
programs which attempt to share the rich cultural heritage of Alaska both with members of local
communities as well as seasonal visitors. Partnerships have been formed with historical societies,
native organizations, universities, public schools, and museums to open a “porthole on the past.”’
This paper presents examples of the Alaska Region's cultural resource outreach and partnership
program and suggests that big productions are not necessarily best.

Investigations of prehistoric hunter-gatherer resource exploitation have been inhibited by method-

conflicting predictions as which parameters will exhibit variation and how these will differ from a

addressed in an analysis of resource use by early Paleoeskimo populations in the Canadian High

[58] CERROS DE TRINCHERAS AND THE CULTURAL LANDSCAPE OF NORTHERN
SONORA, MEXICO
The most prominent sites in northern Sonora and southern Arizona are the Cerros de Trincheras.
These are isolated volcanic hills that are covered with stone terraces and often topped with stone
enclosures, house remains, and compounds. Excavations in the Tucson basin suggest that these sites
were terraced villages. The Cerros de Trincheras of Sonora are usually larger and more complex than
those in Arizona. This paper examines how the creation of these sites would have transformed the
cultural landscape of northern Sonora and discusses the possible economic and symbolic role of these
sites in the late prehistory of northern Sonora.

as well as niches and specific floor areas for the storag of artifacts and food. Walkways were kept
clear and trash was disposed of in specific areas.

Agriculturalists incorporate numerous mobility strategies into their subsistence-settlement sys-

cycle to tend fields in various communities, unlike other groups of agriculturalists who occupy
fieldhouses for shorter periods of time. Many factors influence Tarahumara residential mobility
strategies, including social organization and labor networks, and the distribution and availability
of agricultural land. The Tarahumara settlement system is discussed in terms of these factors.
Archaeological implications of this site use is then explored through ethnoarchaeological observation
on how Tarahumara residences are equipped and maintained.

Ethnographic studies of agricultural societies in the Southwest have provided insights into the use

expressions of these land-use pattems provide a better understanding of the behavior and organization
of the occupants of larger aggregated communities. The data from these sites and their placement on
the landscape provide a more productive avenue toward the explanation of subsistence regimes and
agricultural investment. Remains recovered from aggregated sites are best explained only if the whole
behavioral landscape is studied, Faunal remains recovered from Tijeras pueblo and Rowe pueblo, and
information from small sites surrounding these communities are used to illustrate this point.

Phytoliths were analyzed from Neolithic sites from the Upper Galilee to Southern Sinai. Results
show that Pre-Pottery Neolithic B campsites in Southern Sinai have no cereal remains, but the
presence of phytoliths from other grass husks suggests that wild grasses were being exploited and that
eccupation was seasonal in the spring. Sites of the same period in the Galilee do contain cereal husk
phytoliths, but the low number of silica skeletons, as opposed to single cell phytoliths, suggests that
wet land farming did not begin until the Pottery ey c, at which time silica skeletons are abundant.

to a better knowledge of the Middle Paleolithic there. The new discoveries in Anatolia as well as new

suggest that two traditions might have been present during the Middle Paleolithic; one similar to the
Zagros industries, and the other to the Levantine ones. The understanding of the way these traditions
developed and spread in Turkey is fundamental for the comprehension of human migrations in the

The Maya site of Colha, Belize has been identified as a major center for the production of stone

wasteful of raw material while the other provides a more conservative use of chert. The workshops
are located on adjacent mounds and both date to the same period. These strategies reflect different
responses to the development of Colha as a specialized center for stone tool production.

Analysis of the abundant human remains from the early agricultural village of Abu Hureyra 2 in

of the inhabitants. The mode of burial varied according to the age and sex of the individual. Many
were buried under house floors after exposure of the corpse, and some had their skulls removed.
Comparison with other sites in the Levant and Anatolia suggest that elements of the ideology
underlying such practices were current over a wide area of western Asia during the early Neolithic.

The construction of water control systems is usually considered to be evidence of stress on prehis-

indicative of local ecological conditions and the specific resources that were under stress. Studies of
Southwestern water control systems demonstrate that prehistoric farming was not as ecologically
sound as tradition holds. When the development of Anasazi water control devices is viewed diachroni-
cally, it can be seen that they understood the process of environmental! deterioration and attempted
to counter it both before and after it was initiated.

period. The degree of ceramic specialization is assumed to correlate with the degree of standardization,
which is measured using both rim form and line width measurements. It is expected that the later
glazes will show greater standardization, as the Galisteo Basin became the predominant producer of
glazes during the mid-sixteenth century.

[51] PREHISPANIC IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AT HIERVE EL AGUA, OAXACA, MEXICO

A reinvestigation of Hierve el Agua, located in the upper piedmont zone at the southern end of the
Valley of Oaxaca, has reaffirmed the original interpretation by Neely that the terraces and canal
system, which largely comprise the site, functioned for irrigation agriculture from the Formative
Period well into the Post-Classic Period, This paper will discuss the system's technology, as well as the
diatom and hydrochemical analyses undertaken, to provide evidence that the alternative hypothesis
presented by Hewitt, Winter, and Peterson (1987), proposing that the terraces and canals functioned
for the production of comestible salts, is not viable.

[59] CHANGING LAND USE PATTERNS IN THE EASTERN MIMBRES REGION,
SOUTHWESTERN NEW MEXICO

The changing role of the eastern slope of the Black Range in regional land use patterning is examined
for the prehistoric agricultural occupation from AD 900 to 1300. Changes in regularity and continuity
of land use are assessed using characteristics of small site architecture and artifact assemblages across
a diversity of environmental and topographic features. These data together indicate that the eastern
slope of the Black Range served as an occasional hunting, gathering, and cultivating area into the
Classic Mimbres period (AD 1000-1150), but that land use by the Mimbres people shifted toward
more permanent occupation at spring sites after AD 1150.

[08] RESOURCE AVOIDANCE AND 106: MUST THEY GO HAND IN HAND?

Cultural resource management policies concerning linear surveys conducted in the New Lands and
elsewhere have been dominated by the sponsors’ invariant policy of completely avoiding potentially
significant cultural resources. This policy often proves burdensome to the sponsor given the density
of resources and the complexity of depositional events in the New Lands. Research objectives have
also been hampered by such a one dimensional treatment of cultural resources. Dealing with these
resources in greater depth would more adequately fulfill research objectives and provide a better

“informed base from which to evaluate and manage resources encountered in the future.

B.C.

Although Korean reconstructions of their culture history usually assert that Koreanness, or Korean |
ethnicity, begins with the Ye-Maek/Tungus peoples in the “Bronze Age," the earlier inhabitants
(’’Paleoasiatics”) of the Korean peninsula are seen as deriving from the same region. The mechanism
described is migration, not mere “influences” from Manchuria. This paper examines the archaeologi-
cal evidence in Lianong and Jilin provinces in the northeast of China, and considers |) whether the |
evidence suggests ethnic continuity, 2) whether it is reasonable to consider the inhabitants as either
“Chinese” or Korean,” and 3) to what extent there is continuity in styles which might indicate
ethnic identity.

[22] DOES THE CRAFTSPERSON KNOW BEST?: CERAMIC USE-LIFE STUDIES AND
INFORMANT ACCURACY

Ceramic use-life studies have the potential to increase our understanding of ceramic assemblage
formation, duration of site occupancy, and functional variability. Previous investigations of ceramic
use-life and its applications have been hindered through the forced use of informant estimates of
vessel ages as error-free data. Using unique information obtained by the Kalinga Ethnoarchacological
Project, this paper analyzes informant error and its effect on ceramic use-life estimates. In addition,
variables which increase informant error are identified, to create a profile of people likely to be more
accurate informants to be used by future investigators.

[33] NOTES ON THE X-RAY FLUORESCENCE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE RHYODOCITE

SOURCES OF THE TAOS PLATEAU, NEW MEXICO

Lithic sourcing studies have become increasingly common over the past few years covering a Variety
of raw materials from sedimentary rocks such as chert and jasper to volcanic rocks such as obsidian.
Analytical scope has varied, methods have varied due to the particular material being sourced and
the facilities available, from macroscopic visual appearance to X-ray fluorescence (XRF) and neutron
activation analysis. Less common are sourcing studies regarding minerals such as galena and turquoise
and other predominantly volcanic rock materials such as tephra. This study falls into this latter
category, detailing the XRF characterization of a series of rhyodacite (or alkalic dacite) sources of the
Taos Plateau and the sourcing of a sample of rhyodacite artifacts from three proximal Anasazi sites
of the Taos area of the Norther Rio Grande region, New Mexico. Artifact samples were selected
from the major town of Pot Creek Pueblo, Sagebrush Pueblo, and the Cerrita site all located within
= kilometer of one another along the Rio Grande del Rancho Valley 16km southwest of Taos.

Textiles played a multifaceted role in the Aztec economy, Recent archaeological investigations at
the Aztec city-state of Otumba confirm that magucy fiber production was an important part of the
local economy, and that it was organized differently than cotton fiber production, Small spindle
whorls used to make cotton thread are found at low frequencies in all parts of the Otumba site. The
large magucy spindle whorls, however, occur almost exclusively in workshops defined by dense
concentrations of whorls that are associated with spindle whorl molds with worn obsidian blades and
obsidian and basalt scrapers apparently used to process maguey pencas.

[37] RESEARCH ORIENTATIONS FOR PRESERVING ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROPERTIES AT

CORPS OF ENGINEERS’ WATER RESOURCES PROJECTS

Development of water resources projects assagiated with waterway, reservoir, and coastal settings
often leads to numerous and varied preservation conflicts during both construction and operation/
maintenance phases. Effective and long lasting in place preservation may require identification of
imnovative protection technologies or simply transfer of extant technology from another field.
Research is underway at the U.S. Army Engineer yecver Experiment Station to identify appro-
priate technologies for resource preservation and t6 develop management guidelines and strategies.
This paper reviews the nature of water resources impacts on the archacological record and provides

WEST INDIES

The aceramic sites in the Lesser Antilles represent thi§ area's longest dated occupation (e.z.,
Antigua: about 5000 BP to about 2000 BP}, yet these sites are some of the least studied. The Antiguan
sites provide evidence for the potential identification of different populations moving among the
islands. While most sites represent short-term occupation, others indicate recurrent use with date
ranges of up to 2000 years. Some of the lithic assemblages have obvious evidence of reuse. These
sites’ subsistence remains, locations, and assemblages are discussed in the context of aceramic
population movement as well as potential interaction with later ceramic bearing population.

[04] THE ABANDONED SHIPWRECK ACT: LEGALIZING CONFLICTING VALUES OR
PROTECTING CULTURAL RESOURCES
As a result of several court decisions in the 1970's, archaeologists began to lobby for effective
legislation to protect historic and archaeological shipwrecks situated in state waters. In 1987, Congress
finally promulgated the Abandoned Shipwreck Act which was enacted into law in early 1988. The
National Park Service has recently issued its proposed guidelines for the protection of these resources.
Within this context, it is appropriate to assess the legal ramifications this Act will have on the
activities of salvagers. This paper will focus on the ASA's effectiveness with respect to shipwrecks |

[71] MONTEZUMA’S DINNER RECONSIDERED
Lewis Henry Morgan's essay, “Montezuma’s Dinner,” an attack on Bancroft’s credulous use of
sixteenth-century Spanish sources to reconstruct a lavish court life in Aztec society, was itself an
egregious effort to bend historical data to the contours of evolutionary theory. Students of Aztec
society no longer doubt the wealth of the Aztec empire, but the significance of that wealth continues
to be glossed, much as by Morgan, in economic and evolutionary terms. A fresh look at Montezuma’s
dinner and the essay it inspired prompts a questioning of the prevailing materialist orientation of

[07] VILLAGES, WETLANDS ADAPTATIONS, AND SEDENTISM IN THE GREAT BASIN
Recent research has debated whether mobile hunter-gatherer groups would choose to become
sedentary, to stay near abundant resources, or whether sedentism was a settlement option forced
upon groups by external stresses, Settlement studies in the Lake Abert-Chewaucan Marsh Basin of
south-central Oregon suggest that stress-based explanatory theories are inadequate to account for the
presence of semi-sedentary pithouse villages in wetland settings. This study argues that reduced
mobility in response to resource abundance is fully congruent with recent theoretical constructs and
that explanations for sedentism are probably multi-causal in nature.

Solifluction played a significant role in the transformation of the Upper Paleolithic locality of
Solutre, France, into the archaeological deposits seen today. Located on a talus slope, the Late
Pleistocene horse kill site suffered from downslope migration of its deposits and heavy sediment
loading. The resulting effects include: disarticulation of associated elements, mixing of skeletal
remains from different individuals and of deposits of different ages, breakage and surface abrasion of
bones, and differential preservation of elements of thin versus thick cortical tissue. Analysis incorpo-

[81] NEW LIGHT ON THE ZAGROS UPPER PALEOLITHIC: THE BARADOSTIAN FROM
WARWASI ROCKSHELTER, IRAN
The Baradostian, defined over 30 years ago, has subsequently received little attention or turther
evaluation. Recent analysis of Baradostian chipped stone artifacts (n>14,000) from Warwasi offers
new insights. The original Solecki definition is amplified and refined. Microliths are an important
component, as well as burins. However, examination of the polyhedral (carinated) burins suggests
that these are single platform cores made on flakes/blades. The addition of these “burin-cores” to the
numerous cores, and the microlith frequency, suggest an intensive use of raw material. This may be
a Baradostian expression equivalent to the intensive resharpening of tools in the Mousterian.

[59] FIELD HOUSES, COMMUNITIES, AND LAND USE ON THE PAJARITO PLATEAU
The relationship between habitation sites and nonhabitation sites through time on the Paharito
Plateau are complex and changing. This paper examines agricultural land use on the Pajarito Plateau
by testing predictions for site locations based on climate, population density, and population aggrega- |
tion. It is proposed that when population density and aggregation are low habitation and field house
locations will respond to environmental factors such as precipitation and water tables. As population
density and aggregation increase, habitation locations should respond less to environmental variability
because of social constraints. Field house locations, however, should continue to respond to climatic
and environmental factors.

stature and occupation, American-born males were significantly taller than foreign-born males, As
in the Colonial period, the major factor responsible for stature differences seems to be nutritional.

comparisons contributes to a composite score for cach object examined, artifacts score higher than

[61] THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF OBSIDIAN TRADE WITHIN THE
TARASCAN STATE

With the emergence of the Tarascan state in the fourteenth century, a new economic core region
was formed in Mesoamerica. As more than 90% of the lighic tools used within this state were of
obsidian, it constituted a basic, or strategic, resource. Analysis of the procurement, distribution and
utilization of obsidian can therefore provide a significant means of understanding the way this recently
formed economic/political core interacted with zones to the ¢ast (central Mexico) and west (Nayarit/
falisco). This paper will report on the implications of obsidian trace element analysis of more than
200 artifacts from the Tarascan capital, Tzintzuntzan, and more than 50 artifacts from fortified sites
on the Tarascan/Aztec border.

SEASON
Excavations at Bahia Seca near the Casma Valley on the north Peruvian coast revealed that the site
was occupied from the end of the Cotton Preceramic (about 1800 B.C.) through most of the Initial
Period (1800-900 B.C.). Substantial U-shaped mound and its associated artifacts indicate that Bahia
Seca served as an administrative outpost of the complex inland site of Pampa de las Llamas-Moxeke.
Discovery of a circular structure with a ventilated hearth points to strong connections with the

This paper focuses on the diversity of Upper Paleolithic adaptations in European USSR and the
implications that this record has for cultural practices in Eastern Europe between 40,000 and 10,000
BP. It discusses data from the Upper Paleolithic site clusters along the Dnepr, Don (Kostenko-

[59] SEASONAL CIRCULATION AND DUAL RESIDENCE IN THE PUEBLOAN SOUTHWEST
Southwestern archaeologists have long recognized mobility as an important factor in explaining
the evolution of prehistoric agricultural systems. Changes in mobility are directly associated with
agricultural land use (intensification and extensification) and crop selection (diversification and spe-
cialization). Yet very few studies have adopted a theoretical approach addressing the adaptive signifi-
cance of mobility. This research focuses on one form of mobility, here termed seasonal agricultural
« circulation, which appears to have been widely distributed both in time and space throughout the
Puebloan Southwest. It makes use of circulation theory drawn from the social sciences, particularly
anthropology and geography. As a case study, patterns of seasonal agricultural circulation on the
Pajarito Plateau (A.D. 1150-1550) are examined.

Interdisciplinary research in Hawaii examines the interrelationships among geomorphic forms and
processes and Polynesian land use and settlement. The research considers how early Polynesian
manipulation of the landscape necessitated concomitant modification of their culture. I contend that
Polynesian agriculture deforested the slopes of wet windard valleys. The denuded slopes were exposed
to accelerated erosion and the transported materials were deposited on sand bars and dunes and in
lagoons and bays. The former marine ecosystems, therefore, evolved into today’s marshes and plains.
Results from the research are used to examine early Polynesian adjustments to these rapidly changing
environments.

FROM THE MISSOURI OZARKS
Caddoan and Mississippian presence in the Ozark Highlands was more significant than once
believed. However, the attenuated nature of occupations in the Missouri Ozarks suggest participation
only in the initial stages of the Mississippianization process stopping short of the same levels of
population aggregation, labor intensification, status differentiation, resource consumption, and cere-
monial complexity seen in the Arkansas and Mississippi alluvial valleys, Late prehistoric Ozarks
societies appear to have participated in regional systems in which they were technically equal but
socially peripheral and politically subordinate to the Caddoan and Mississippian centers whose
demands for surplus products they were constrained to meet.

A variety of community organizations are known for the ancient Andes, from dispersed settlements

witnessed the first construction of large architectural cogsplexes in Peru and it is generally assumed
that social complexity also began during this time. Thetvidence for settlement types, shifts from
jog-field zones to valleys, and the development of social complexity in association with monumental
centers will be reviewed in this paper. It will be demonstrated that many of the previous assumptions

The usual practice in examining cultural change is to assign artifact assemblages to internally

analysis of the structure of change over much smaller spatio-temporal units. In the Southeast, rapid
replacement of the spear by the bow and arrow in Late Woodland times has been assumed. To study
, 142 Raish, Carol
this change, projectile points from sites in northeast Mississippi were seriated and a master chronology
of assemblages constructed. Changes in point size, resharpening, and breakage over the sequence
showed that the shift may have begun in the Middle Woodland period.

[40] DOMESTIC ANIMALS AND STABILITY IN PRE-STATE FARMING SOCIETIES
This study focuses on the organization of pre-state agricultural subsistence systems as reflected in
their use of domesticated animal resources. Examination of 16 archaeological sequences from pre-
state farming groups in the Old and New Worlds identifies a pattern of significantly shorter sequence
duration for this period in the New World than in the Old World and Peru. One possible cause of this
difference in duration may be the contributions of domesticated animals to economic stability.
Ethnographic information is used to determine the contributions of animal domesticates. This study
suggests that subsistence-level farming economies with domesticated animals are more stable, in
terms of duration, than those without animals, which may lead to the shorter pre-state farming
periods of the New World.

[48] QUINCENTENARY RESEARCH IN PERSPECTIVE
Because the Columbian Quincentenary has stimulated considerable research in archaeology, his-

sions of the timing and nature of native population change? If research on the early contact period has
changed our perceptions, than how do we integrate this knowledge into the fabric of our disciplines? If
new knowledge has not changed our perceptions, then what reasons can be offered for this absence?
I provide gencral answers to these questions in this paper. In addition, the context of individuals

cross-validation of ancient and modern garbage studies covers a wide range of research concerns,
including, diet and health, patterns of food waste, hazardous waste in household refuse, demographic
reconstructions from refuse, archaeological formation processes, and household-level recycling and

[33] COPING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY: SOCIAL NETWORKS AND CERAMIC

Effective cultural responses to risk involve adoption of coping strategies of a nature and scale
sufficient to mitigate that risk. Here the structure of environmental variability is used as an indepen-
dent predictor of the structure of effective cultural response. A model of modern climatic variability
in central New Mexico is used to develop expectations regarding network formation and exchange
for prehistoric cultivators at the Kite Site (LA-38448), which dates from about A.D. 900-1100. The
climatic model provides the basis for identifying how social/cultural factors such as demography,
technological organization, and economic structure affect adoption of a given coping strategy.

from existing soil types. The model discriminates between 30 biotically distinct habitats and defines
specific suites of foraging strategies appropriate to each. The lesson of the exercise, currently being
tested for its archacological implications, is that the timing and intensity of exploitation of wetland
habitats largely are functions of what is and what is not available in the surrounding landscape.

Darwinian evolutionary theory provides archacologists with a framework for the scientific study

differential persistence, it is not a causal agent. The assertion of selection operating is not sufficient;
selective forces must be identified. Lately, we suggest that fitness must be specified in clearly
defined and measurable terms, Furthermore, we suggest a structure for research which facilitates the

Many recent interpretations of prehistoric Chacoan roads stress their roles as a regional transporta-

present evidence does not support the notion that most prehistoric roads are elements of a regionally
integrated road system, and there is little reason to believe that they were built to facilitate transporta-

it seems likely that their major role is in the realm of social organization. Ultimately the act of their

132] CHANGES IN HUMAN SEDENTISM, MOBILITY, AND SUBSISTENCE DURING THE

PLATEAU PITHOUSE TRADITION ON THE CANADIAN PLATEAU

The Plateau Pithouse Tradition (3500 to 200 yr B.P.) was an era of relative cultural and adaptive
stability during the late prehistoric period on the Canadian Plateau. However, within this lengthy and
reasonably consistent tradition of logistically-organized, semi-sedentary adaptations, three sequent
periods representing distinct variations on a generalized adaptive theme can be discerned, Using recent

(56] ABANDONMENT IN ZUNI FARMING VILLAGES

A group of villages on the Zuni reservation, used segsonally by farmers and herders, have been
virtually unoccupied (but not necessarily abandoned) for 40—SO0 years. Two studies, ten years apart,
have examined structures in these villages. This paper will consider a number of issues in relation to
abandonment, which is seen on a continuum ranging from full occupation to use of a structure for
stotage, as a raw material source, or a means to maintain q claim to land. We will also discuss the
measurable source, or a means to maintain a claim to laste, We will also discuss the measurable
eschitectural effects of lack of occupation, and what artifacts are left behind.

69] THE FUNCTION OF WOODLAND PLATFORM MOUNDS: THE VIEW FROM THE LEAKE

SITE

Archacologists suffer from an unfortunate lack of interpretable data when it comes to Woodland
platform mounds. In 1989, the University of Georgia excavated the mmnants of a Middle Woodland
platform mound at the Leake site on the Etowah River. Postmolds, numerous features, midden lenses,
faunal remains, and botanical data allow us to infer the activities performed on this mound and, from
these data, examine activities that did or did not take place on contemporary platform mounds in the
Piedmont. This approach will provide a better understanding of the reasons for variability in these
mounds.

$82] THE MIDDLE PRECLASSIC IN THE CAVERNS OF COPAN

In 1983, members of the Proyecto Arqueologico Copan, Phase I, revisited two caves north of Copan
initially explored by George Gordon in 1896. Skeletal analysis of the Middle Preclassic burials sampled
, 148 Ruppe’, Patricia A. and Carol B. Brandt
from one cave indicated that these individuals, mostly cremated burials, were in better health than
the Late Classic population, and that the burial population cross-cut age and sex groups. Pollen
analysis identified ritual offerings in the caves, both associated with and independent of burials. The
evidence implies that socio-political systems in Middle Preclassic Copan were relatively egalitarian,
but that some individuals may have been marked by achieved special status.

[05] SUBSISTENCE IN THE ZUNI RIVER VALLEY: THE ARCHAEOBOTANICAL DATA
A synthesis of archaeobotanical data from 18 archaeological sites in the Zuni River Valley reveals
an agricultural record that extends from the late Archaic to the late Historic periods. Current models
propose that population growth in the valley during the late prehistoric and historic periods should
result in agricultural intensification and subsistence change. An examination of the archacological
data, however, indicates that the relative importance of maize agriculture varies little among all time
periods. Even with the introduction of new cultigens and a cash economy in the late historic period,
gathering remained an important component of Zuni subsistence.

[25] PRECERAMIC THROUGH MOCHE SETTLEMENT PATTERN CHANGE IN THE
CHICAMA VALLEY, PERU
Using refinements in the architectural and ceramic chronologies made during the first season of
the Chicama Valley Settlement Survey, settlement pattern change from the Preceramic through
Moche Periods is evaluated. Construction of the irrigation systems and a shift to defensive site
locations during the Middle Formative suggest that competition over agricultural resources among
local polities was important in the development of complex society. A shift to undefended site
locations and major labor investments in ceremonial architecture indicate valley wide political
control and integration by the Late Formative or Early Moche Period.

It has been reinterpreted by Schwartz, Euler, Schroeder, Cartledge and others. Widespread intensive
surveys by Kaibab Forest archaeologists in the last 15 years have laid the basis for new interpretations.
Excavations by the MNA-NAU Field School show that regional expressions of Cohonina culture are

Recent ceramic analyses on collections from the N2007 project on Navajo Newlands indicate the

as being regionally restricted. In addition, significant quantities of this material were identified on
the near by Navajo Springs great house. The implications of this newly identified redware tradition

Recent coastal surveys in the central Canadian Arctic have provided evidence for extensive bowhead
whaling and secondary whale bone utilization by prehistoric Thule Eskimos (ca. A.D. 1000-1600).
Over 10,000 bowhead whale bone elements, representing a minimum of over 1025 individuals, are
incorporated within a variety of processing, caching, and residential sites. A behavioral framework is
presented to explain the distribution and abundance of bowhead elements within the various site

selection for future use; 5) dwelling construction and maintenance; 6) recycling of bone elements; 7)

[58] ALTERNATIVE VISIONS AND LANDSCAPES: ARCHAEOLOGY OF THE SHAKER SOCIAL
ORDER AND ITS BUILT ENVIRONMENT
The success of the Shaker movement was directly related to its ability to create distinct, replicable
communities incorporating the metaphor of the family. This ability enabled the Shakers to challenge
relations of power and domination within the institutions of mainstream society. Contradictions
between theories of power and gender were played out within male/female and secular/sacred arenas
of the Shakers’ spiritual and temporal world. Social tensions arising from the transformation of a
gender-balanced movement to one dominated by women are reflected in the Shaker built environment.

ARCHAEOLOGY, ETHNOHISTORY, AND THEORY FOR THE APALACHEE CHIEFDOM
Archaeological and ethnohistorical data from Apalachee, a Mississippian chiefdom in the southeast-
em U.S., have been interpreted as indicating that the Apalachee had a four-tiered settlement hierarchy
and three administrative levels above the household. These interpretations cast doubt on models of
chicfdom organization and the common practice of investigating political structure by equating
settlement hierarchies to administrative hierarchies. The Apalachee data are re-examined and alterna-

that caution be exercised when attempting to measure complex phenomena such as political and

[56] LOCAL ABANDONMENTS AND REGIONAL CONDITIONS IN THE NORTHERN
AMERICAN SOUTHWEST

The archaeological record of the American Southwest is replete with abandoned places that once
supported a vigorous population of horticulturalists under trying environmental conditions. These
same conditions are often suggested as a cause of the abandonments. Do the circumstances of structure
and site abandonment support this? Data from the Dolores Archaeological Program are used to
compare the abandonment histories pertaining to particular structures with models of external envi-
ronmental conditions and demographic shifts that redistributed people across the local landscape.
Architectural features, stratigraphic sequences, and the composition of artifact assemblages from
sealed deposits are used to evaluate abandonment circumstances and the fit between abandonment

FROM THE MAYA POSTCLASSIC PERIOD

There are three qualitatively distinct categories of craft production directed toward manufacturing

‘ Carbon-13 values of 13 soil profiles along an altitude transect between 1900 m and 3000 m were
measured at four intervals between the surface and 55 cm. The transect spans the C4 grassland to C3
forest transition zone. Currently forested sites above 2400 m and below 3000 m supported semi-open
grasslands during the middle Holocene. This demonstrates that the forest/grassland ecotone, currently
located below 2400 m, was higher than 2700 m during this time, Mid-Holocene dry phase hunter-
gatherer settlements also shifted to higher altitudes at this time, The soil carbon isotopic evidence
supports the model of ecotonal settlement preference for Holocene hunter-gatherers in the Central

In 1987-89 we carried out survey in the northern valleys of the Rio Grande de Nazca drainage. Our
complementary projects were designed to provide basic data on the full range of cultures that flour-
ished in this region in the prehispanic era. Within our total sample of approximately eight hundred
sites are several that shed important new light on Nasca-Wari interaction. On the basis of existing
radiocarbon measurements, iconography, economic shifts, changes in the pattern of trophy-head
taking, and change in settlement pattern we propose that Wari impacted Nasca during florescent

Nasca 5 period, rather than following Nasca 8 as the current dogma holds, This temporal realignment

necessitates consideration of a model of initial Nasca-Wari coexistence rather than immediate con-

quest and incorporation.

Recent excavations at major Neolithic centers in Jordan have changed our understandings of early
village life. Srudies at ‘Ain Ghazal and Wadi Shu’eib suggest an adaptive strategy distinct from that

Neolithic to Pottery Neolithic. These sites were abandoned after the Neolithic. A model of culturally
induced environmental degradation and subsequent pastoral exploitation of the eastern steppes, which
were unavailable to Neolithic peoples further west, has been proposed as one scenario to explain the
abandonment. The sites and the model are reviewed in this paper.

LAKE MARSHES

Between AD 1250-1350 in the marshes along the Great Salt Lake, Fremont agriculture/hunting
and gathering yielded to full time hunting and gathering which persisted through the Late Prehistoric
period. Declining precipitation represented by regressive lake levels negatively influenced agriculture
while doubling available marshland. In response, the adaptive strategy shifted from a central base
collector strategy featuring agriculture toward a collector strategy featuring smaller group size,
wncreased residential mobility, and decreased logistic mobility. Explanations for why agriculture failed
to return during later transgressive lake levels are explored as necessary to a full explanation of the
earlier transition.

{61] 1 SEE THEIR DUMP, BUT WHERE’S THE TOWN? THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUSTOS
WICKIUP SITE

The Bustos site near Ely, Nevada consists of five juniper log structures estimated to date between
A.D. 1750-1800. Few artifacts were found in and among the structures. However, large areas of dense
lithic debris, eight stone rings for pine nut storage, and other debris form a distinctive spatial pattern
around the structures. Stumps and a partially burned and chopped, but standing juniper accompanied
by a stone axe, testify as to the method of cutting logs. In one sense, only the people are missing and
the site is examined as an “ethnoarchaeological” situation to site structure studies.

[22] VARIATION AND COMMONALITY AMONG SALADO WARES IN CENTRAL ARIZONA

Salado ceramics (ca. AD 1300-1450) from the Roosevelt Lake area of central Anzona include diverse
examples of plain, corrugated, and decorated wares, This research seeks to define variation and
commonality within a full ceramic assemblage of Salado wares. The relationships among ceramic
production, function, and provenance are examined across wares, local and nonlocal products. Direct
physical property testing of these prehistoric samples is used to compare the suitability and durability
of different vessel classes for certain tasks. The associations of physical properties with vessel form,
production techniques, and materials is examined§

[33] A CRITICAL REVIEW OF OBSIDIAN HYDRATION SAMPLING STRATEGIES IN

CALIFORNIA AND THE GREAT BASIN

Obsidian hydration is a commonly used—and misused— dating technique in the wester United
States. Obsidian hydration sampling strategies generally have little or no relationship to research
questions and the results are used uncritically, which can seriously affect interpretation of site use
and function. Obsidian hydration is in fact a complicated process, and obsidian hydration sampling
designs need to take into account such variables as site formation processes, climatic variability,
technology, and prehistoric scavenging and reuse. Various sampling strategies and the conclusions
drawn with each are discussed, along with suggestions for sampling that consider the above-mentioned
variables.

A common occurrence on surveys in the Four Corners area is the recovery of morphologically early

continuity, scavenging and reworking, and curation. Recent surveys in the ‘New Lands” have shown
this pattern to be present. Data generally collected within a CRM framework are clearly insufficient
to address the problem; data needed, within an ideal research framework, include recovery of small

A recent regional study on the prehistoric towers from the Gallina area revealed that the prehistoric

data taken from tower sites was utilized to determine if the towers were built within line-of-sight.
This preliminary study.revealed that there exists a high occurrence of line-of-sight between “known”

cates a level of social networking transcending that which has been traditionally suggested by archaeol-
ogists.

[06] CONTEXTS OF INTERACTION AND STRUCTURAL MARXIST APPROACHES IN
ARCHAEOLOGY

Structural marxist approaches in archaeology are becoming quite popular. These approaches often
center around a concept of two levels of social structure; the top, often ideological, and the under or
social reality. But what is often referred to as the social reality 1s actually isolated in a specific context
of interaction. A common social! reality did not exist. Examples from the early Mediterranean indicate
that a more productive analysis would concentrate on the relationship of the contexts themselves
rather than on ambiguous notions of universal top and under structure.

[64] MATERIAL EXPRESSIONS OF WEALTH AND STATUS AT LATE POSTCLASSIC SITES IN
MORELOS, MEXICO

This paper analyzes domestic contexts at the Late Postclassic sites of Cuexcomate and Capilco in
Morelos, Mexico. Two domains of variation—the energetic and the visual—are considered in relation
to residential architecture and domestic artifacts. Elite residences are far more “costly” and visually
distinct than common houses, and while no domestic artifact classes are exclusively linked to the
elite, high-status households clearly had greater access to imported goods and status-communicating
serving ware. These results are consistent with both materialist/energetic models of wealth and
communication/information models of status, and indicate the value of both approaches to the study
of ancient patterns of social stratification.

[28] PALEORCOLOGY OF SOUTHWESTERN NORTH AMERICA: THE LAST 15,000 YEARS

During the Wisconsin Glacial Age floristic elements with affinities to present Great Basin steppe
occurred as far south as Michoacan, and southwest to at least the northem Chihuahuan Desert.
Complex readjustments of plant species’ ranges occurred at the end of the last glacial age, between
ca. 12,000 and 8,000 yr BP. The few paleoecological records conducted suggest aridity greater than
that of the present between ca. 7,500 and 5,500 yr BP. Subsequent increase in the mesophytic character
of vegetation throughout the region reached a climax between 2,000 and 1500 yr BP. The final phase
of modernization of southwestern ecosystems occurred over the last ca. 1000 years, with a modest
but notable decline in the importance of mesophytic plant species.

four or five centuries in Teotihuacan they retained a distinctive ethnic identity, reflected in the
persistence of Zapotec ceramic types (locally produced), ritual practices and architectural forms.
Four sequentially used tombs of Zapotec style were found. Possible explanations for this persistent

OF THE SOUTHERN DESERT AND SEMI DESERT REGIONS OF NORTH AMERICA

The earliest known remains of human populations occupying the southern deserts and peripheral

than 3,000 years. Most of these Archaic and Late Prehistoric skeletal remains have been recovered
from the Trans-Pecos, Lower Pecos and eastern margin of the Tamaulipan biotic province in Texas.
Structurally, these samples indicate the desert{populations were small and gracile peoples with
relatively long heads. The few dental descriptions present indicate a pattern characteristic of other
North American populations. Examination of an early Archaic assemblage from the Chihuhuan Desert
indicates that some of these peoples at least were healthy and well adapted to their environment.

Faunal remains from the Neolithic (seventh Millennium BC) village of Gritille, Turkey, are used
to formulate a model in which sedentism and risk aversion help account for the shift from hunting to
herding economy. I suggest that the development of sedentary agriculture during the eight millennium
caused scheduling conflicts with the hunting cycle, while creating new configurations of seasonal
uncertainty in subsistence. Gritille villagers apparently adapted to these constraints by abandoning
the summer hunt and shifting winter hunting to a “least effort’ strategy emphasizing seasonally
available game in the Euphrates Valley. Implications of these changes for animal domestication are

For archaeologists, interpretation of an artifact’s context is a reconstruction of its original position

on deposits rather than on individual objects, Associations and descriptions are used to reconstruct
what happened to the deposit since it was laid down, but the associations are used to reconstruct a
collective history of all the objects in the deposit. Although artifacts were manufactured and used,
and those additional interpretations are of interest, to interpret what happened to an artifact since its
abandonment requires considering it as part of a geological deposit.

Archaeological sites with associated barbed bone points, lithics, pottery, and abundant fish remains

sites show a greater subsistence reliance on fish and a greater diversity of taxa, reflecting more
familiarity with fish and lake ecology, Changes in the material culture assemblages reflect new

[55] PALEOCLIMATIC INDICATORS IN THE LATE QUATERNARY FAUNA OF THE LEVANT

The updated information on the Levantine late Pleistocene mammalian assemblages enables us to
trace the faunal turnover throughout the period, and correlate it with biotic and abiotic factors. :
The magnitude of the environmental changes were steep enough to affect the micromammalian '
communities, and the genetic construction of populations. It was not effective enough to cause an
overall faunal turnover of large mammals; their extinction during the Holocene is mainly anthropo-
genic. Significant microfaunal changes are recorded from the early Mousterian (late stage 5), stage 4
|=Tabun D), scarcely during the later Mousterian, but more suggestive in the Upper Paleolithic and
early Holocene.

[40] HAROLD J. COOK AND JESSE FIGGINS: A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON THE FOLSOM
DISCOVERY

The 1926 discovery of the Folsom site and its subsequent evaluation in North American archaeology
is well-known. This paper explores the level of intentionality in the search for evidence of Late
Pleistocene humans and the dynamic relationships of Harold J. Cook and Jesse Figgins which fueled
this search. Although Figgins and particularly Cook are sometimes regarded as amateurs who hap-
pened upon fluted point sites, archival records reveal a lengthy paleontological field program, sup-
ported by the Colorado Museum of Natural History, which carefully watched for early human

Collection of data from small-scale surveys such as fence lines and water tank locations often is

It has been common practice to verify architecturally based notions of the Chaco system using
selected ceramic traits attributed to Chaco rather than by independently defining regional systems
and then comparing the whole with roads and architecture, Understanding the similarities in ceramic
assemblages across the Anasazi area would shed considerable light on the place of Chaco in the

were the manifestations of the Chacoan system simply overlays on more enduring patterns of Anasazi

[82] SITE ABANDONMENT BEHAVIOR AMONG TRANSHUMANT AGRO-PASTORALISTS:;
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF SITE USE AND FUNCTION

Ethnoarchacological fieldwork among transhumant agro-pastoralists in SW Bolivia defined three
types of household abandonment: seasonal, intermittent, and permanent. Three segments form the
community settlement pattern: the pastoral, agricultural, and main village. The recycling of house-
hold assemblages following abandonment alters their pre-abandonment size, composition, and associa-
tional integrity. This paper discusses the effects of recycling on reconstruction of segment use and

. function. In addition, it explores the factors conditioning the recycling of different artifact classes
to define the expected post-abandonoment skewness in assemblage composition under the three
abandonment types.

[20] THE BEST OF BOTH WORLDS: HISTORIC, ECONOMIC, AND CLIMATIC FACTORS
RELATED TO EARLY VILLAGE FORMATION IN THE MIDDLE MISSOURI SUBAREA OF
THE PLAINS

The Northern Plains of North America were dominated by nomadic hunter-gatherers for 11,000
years until ca. A.D. 1000 when sedentary peoples of the Middle Missouri tradition (Plains Village
pattern} began to occupy the Middle Missouri subarea. These early village dwellers had dual subsis-
tence economies based on (1) simple agriculture and (2) hunting and gathering. The development of
the Middle Missouri tradition is complex and related to a combination of factors, including a prior
history of village life in the cast, the lure of bison with the potential to still practice agriculture, and
an improved local climate that facilitated the adaptive process.

[06] SAMPLE COMPARABILITY AND ASSEMBLAGE STRUCTURE AS INFERENTIAL TOOLS
Appearance of ditched camps, a major settlement of terminal neolithic western Europe, has been
variously related to increasing social differentiation. However, these sites comprise complex, crosscut-
tung building phases, giving samples of widely oe size and making difficult comparison of
assemblage structure across time. Measures of richnéss and evenness, compared with expected values
under three hypotheses of site use and duration, assess comparability of samples as these hypotheses
are tested. Results of lithic analysis indicate that scope of activity can be adressed with such samples,
whereas extra-regional procurement cannot. The consistent, broad-scale pattern of activity seen in
the Charente drainage of western France differs significantly from the intermittent, possibly ceremo-
nial use postulated for some sites in northern France and southern England.

PRESERVES

Preserving and managing archaeological sites on private land poses special problems and offer
unique opportunities for innovation, As development pressures increase in areas where sites are
prolific, the challenge facing the preservation planner is to preserve sites without hindering develop-
ment. That challenge can often be met by designating sites as open space. Sites can also be preserved
within golf courses and recreational areas. Protection and a management of private preserves can
become a community issue involving individual volunteers as well as home owner's associations.

06] STATUS AND SUBSISTENCE IN PRE-STATE AND EARLY STATE SOCIETY

The transition from chiefdom to state during the 3rd and 4th millennia BC in Southeast Turkey
was accompanied by changes in organization of subsistence production and patterns of consumption.
Spatial analysis of animal bones and agricultural tools from Kurban Hoyuk indicates that, as states
developed in the region, subsistence production became specialized on the non-elite household level.
Results of this study of subsistence artifacts are combined with evidence for changes in regional
settlement patterns and craft production, as well as epigraphic data, to examine relationships among
political control, tributary economy, and subsistence production. The emergence of specialized subsis-
tence economy is linked to changes in political and economic ties between centers and satellite
communities, and to changes in relationships between social classes in early complex societies.

Sinagua sites classifiable as villages first appeared in the Flagstaff area in the middle 1100s A.D.
Previous to that only hamlets, farmsteads, and seasonal sites are known. Possible factors affecting
the reorganization of Sinagua populations into small villages and their associated site clusters are
discussed. It is argued that the adoption of Hohokam-style ballcourts a century earlier led to increased
, Wilson, Samuel M. 171
wealth, greater interaction with neighboring groups, and changes in household organization. Village
formations emerged as a response to changes in the structure of the macroregional economic field,
permitting the Sinagua to take advantage, however briefly, of unique exchange opportunities.

[61] HUMAN DNA RECOVERY FROM ANCIENT BONE
Human DNA has been isolated in a skeleton from the Estuquina site, a Late Intermediate Period
site in southern Peru (ca. 1300 AD). A radioactively labeled sample of the bone DNA used as a probe,
Hybridized well with modern human DNA in a slot blot test. This indicates that the DNA is human,
and not an invasive fungus or microorganism. The implications for archaeological research include
the examination of migration patterns, political organization, marriage alliances and familial relation-
ships from a new perspective.

[07] PALEO-ARCHAIC LAKE-MARSH ADAPTATIONS AT THE PLEISTOCENE-HOLOCENE
BOUNDARY IN THE NORTHERN ALKALI LAKE BASIN, OREGON
Reconstructions of paleolandscape, lake history and early human occupations in the norther Alkali
Lake Basin, Oregon—between 12,000 and 7,000 B.P—suggest a long history of dynamic Archaic
foraging and settlement patterns “tethered” to changing lake-marsh conditions. In particular, a two-
peak florescence of Western Stemmed sites is evident between 10,000 and 8,000 B.P., the earlier peak
radiocarbon dated at 9,600 B.P. These occupations are associated with two early Holocene strandlines
and remains of marsh dwelling gastropods, and correspond to two mesic episodes documented in the
regional climatic record at about 9,500 and 8,500 B.P. |

[20] HAMLETS AND VILLAGES IN PRESTATE SETTINGS: A WORLDWIDE PERSPECTIVE
Archaeologist working in prestate settings typically distinguish between dispersed settlements
consisting of multiple hamlets and aggregated settlements characterized by villages of one to five
hundred people. However, there has been little discussion of how aggregated and dispersed communi-
ties differ from one another—on other than a demographic basis. Using a random sample of prestate
societies from the HRAF Standard Sample and a judgement sample of formative archaeological
examples, we will outline some of the basic organizational and economic differences between dis-
persed and aggregated communities for prestate societies.

[60] DISCARD DISTRIBUTIONS AND THE MEASUREMENT OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR
Two distinctive types of human behavior which can be reconstructed from household discards are
(1) activities related to use and (2) activities related to storage. These two behavioral types are related
to two characteristic distributions of refuse. The material fraces of these activities represent a measure
of behavior with which aspects of both living and prehistoric populations might be compared. Modern
refuse data collected by the Garbage Project is used to illustrate both the refuse patterning and
associated behaviors. Methods to examine these same processes in archaeological deposits are out-
lined. ;

[62] DANGEROUS WATERS: CONTACT PERIOD INTERACTION SPHERES IN THE LEEWARD
ISLANDS
The contact period in the Caribbean is often seen as a brief cataclysm that in a few decades
decimated the indigenous populations. The impact of European contact, however, manifested itself
in different ways at different times in different regions of the Caribbean. This paper looks at the period
from 1492 until around 1650, in which Spanish, English, French, and Dutch groups were exploring
and settling the Leeward Islands. From their accounts, and from archaeological research in the region,
a picture emerges of a widely distributed population which relied on a high degree of mobility to
survive in the competitive political environment of the contact period.

[17] THE EARLY BONITO PHASE IN THE CHACO CANYON AREA

The role of the early Bonito phase to our understanding of the Chaco Phenomenon is an important
one, The period is poorly defined and far less distinctive than the soaring multi-story massive stone
houses and attendant trappings that follow it during the Classic Period. In our quest for the definition
of ‘what is Chaco”, this paper explores this early period, its continuity with earlier and later Anasazi
occupations, and its unique components that comprise the beginnings of the Chacoan Bonito phase.

{12} THE ROLE OF SOILS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL SEQUENCE AT COPAN, HONDURAS

Soils are one of the most important resources in an agricultural society. At Copan, Honduras there
is evidence that the distribution of soils of varying agricultural quality played an important role in
shaping the settlement patterns of the Classic and Postclassic Maya. Furthermore, the depletion of
this resource may have been a key factor in the dramatic decline in population at the end of the
Classic period. Nutrient depletion and the increasing reliance on highly erodible soils, resulting from
population growth and the escalating demand for agricultural commodities, led to a marked decline
in the availability of arable land.

[25] THE COTTON PRECERAMIC PERIOD IN THE SOUTH-CENTRAL ANDES

The Late Preceramic Period {after 5000 B.P.) in the central Andes is known for complex social,
political, and religious organization, the presence of monumental architecture, and an elaborate cotton
textile industry. Cultural manifestations during this time period in the south-central Andes have long
been thought to be less complex. Recent research at Late Preceramic sites in southern Peru reveals the
presence of sedentary habitations, aggregated settlements, distinctive cotton textiles, and a complex of
paraphernalia apparently associated with the use of hallucinogenic drugs. Research in domestic and
midden contexts provides new data from this time period in southern Peru, and demonstrates variation
in domestic architecture from sites within close proximity of one another, and across the south-
central Andean region.

[12] MUYIL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS; A MODEL FOR THE EAST COAST POSTCLASSIC

Muyil is an ancient Maya site on the Quintana Roo East Coast occupied from AD 1~—1500. It served
as a port for Coba during the Classic. Recent field surveys indicate later extensive low-density
settlement at moderate distances from the civic and ceremonial center of the site. The Muyil pattern

‘ of settlement in the Postclassic serves as a model for the study of other east coast sites which
flourished between Tulum and Cancun. It may represent the settlement forms at Spanish contact,
when first explorers noted numerous vigorous settlements along the coast.

[47] GROUND STONE ASSEMBLAGE VARIATION AND SUBSISTENCE STRATEGIES IN THE
NEAR EASTERN LEVANT, 22,000—5,500 B.P.

Data on 19 ground stone assemblages from Jordan are presented in order to clarify the significance
of ground stone technology in the evolution of sedentary agriculture in southwestern Asia. The sites
span 22,000 to 5,500 B.P, and include transient camps and villages with architecture in a variety
of environments (e.g. Beidha, Ain Ghazal, Azraq). When whole assemblages are analyzed with a
technological perspective, ground stone tools shed light on the relationship of resource distribution

to patterns of consumption promoting early sedentism. Portability and caching of grinding tools were
basic to their role in late Pleistocene/early Holocene subsistence systems.

[70] SAYIL (YUCATAN MEXICO) LITHICS: IMPLICATIONS FOR URBAN ECONOMIC
ORGANIZATION

This paper presents the results of the analysis of lithics from Sayil (800-1000 AD), and the implica-
tions of said results for understanding the socio-economic organization of a Terminal Classic Maya
city. A functional analysis of the lithics permits some delineation of the reduction sequence, and its
spatial manifestations. These artifacts are placed in their regional context as a Puuc assemblage. The
lithic data, with their spatial attributes, are evaluated in socio-economic terms, and ultimately, are
used to test models of urban organization.

[46] “AN UNEXAMINED LIFE IS NOT WORTH LIVING”: FORTHRIGHT REALISM AND
SCIENTIFIC PRACTICE IN ARCHAEOLOGY

The reflective turn taken by American archaeology in the 1960s and 1970s raised a number of
challenging questions about fundamentals: the nature of the subject domain, the aims of the discipline,
and the epistemic and methodological ideals that should govern its inquiries. This paper will examine
the answers formulated by Pat Watson in connection with the third of these questions, given her
commitment to scientific objectives (where the second is concerned). Realist commitments have
been central to her vision of the prospects of a scientific archaeology from the outset, and they are
only just beginning to find full programmatic and practical articulation.

[52] MEETING THE PUBLIC’S NEED FOR HERITAGE RESOURCE EXPERIENCES

Providing opportunities for the public to experience and understand the past is an exciting and
challenging aspect of managing cultural resources on our National Forests, Modern marketing princi-
ples require a customer orientation and emphasis on quality products, as well as effective delivery
systems and feedback to measure customer satisfaction. The diversity of sites and public interest call
for a wide range of approaches; limited budgets encourage the use of volunteers and partnerships; and
serendipity demands quick, opportunistic responses. Several successful projects are examined to
illustrate these principles, as well as the limitations of the approaches used.

Lithic functional analysis is used to investigate shell craft production in Mississippian societies
(A.D. 1000-1400) with special emphasis on ier Mississippian populations in the American
Bottom region. The technology of the Cahokia ““Microlith” industry is examined, and the microwear
evidence that indicates that Cahokia microdrills were specialized tools used to drill shell beads,
gorgets, etc., is summarized. The distribution of shell drills and shell! materials at sites in the Cahokia
séttlement system is outlined and the implications for craft specialization in Mississippian societies
is discussed. i

[61] A REASSESSMENT OF CULTURE HISTORY IN THE WESTERN GREAT BASIN: DATA
FROM A NEW SUITE OF RADIOCARBON DATES FROM THE ROSE SPRING SITE (CA-
INY-372)

New archaeological investigations at the Rose Spring site in southeastern California have forced a
reevaluation of existing cultural chronologies for the western Great Basin. The currently accepted
chronologies for this region have been in large part based upon the earlier investigations conducted
at this site in the 1950s. Rose Spring (the type site for Rose Spring projectile points) has been pivotal
to such discussions because of its artifact-rich, deep, culturally and physically stratified deposit. A
suite of more than twenty new radiocarbon determinations has provided data for a revised view of
regional prehistory.

[40] AN ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPROACH TO REGIONAL POLITICAL STRUCTURES

Archaeological attempts to define the boundaries of polities are often less than convincing. Perhaps
the problem is a concept of polity base on an ethnographic or historical point of view. Other concepts
may be equally valid but more appropriate to archacological data. Looking at the spatial distribution
, 174 York, Robert, Gary Matlock, Allen Kane and E. Polly Hammer
of evidence produced by or affected by different sorts of political processes may allow insights into
political structures other than those recognized by ethnographers or historians.

[52] THE VIEW FROM THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS

The National Forests of the Rocky Mountain Region are actively involving the public in their CRM
programs. The efforts of the San Juan National Forests are diverse and many, including: placement of
protection-oriented historic markers, development of museum exhibits, construction of handicapped
access trails at the Chimney Rock Archeological Area, formation of a citizens group to support the
Forest’s CRM programs, the interpretation of a historical Ute campground in cooperation with the
Ute Mountain Tribe, and the execution of a cost-share agreement with the Four Corners School of
Outdoor Education to conduct research at the Miller Camp site. During 1988 and 1989 the Gunnison
and San Isabel National Forests, in cooperation with the Colorado State University, began a research
and interpretation project of the Monarch Pass Game Drive.

[14] PITHOUSES AND FIELDHOUSES: A COMPARISON

This paper will compare two different types of sites: Pithouse villages and fieldhouses. Although
these sites are argued to be used seasonally by farming populations, the residential mobility patterns
of the groups using these two types of sites is expected to be quite different. Data from recent
excavations in the Homol’ovi area of northeastern Arizona will be used to examine how the artifact
assemblage of these sites differs. It is expected that differences in mobility will be reflected in the
assemblages of these seasonally used sites.

[53] EARLY HOLOCENE VEGETATION OF THE CENTRAL GREAT PLAINS BASED ON
CHARCOAL FROM THE ALLEN SITE

Although other models have been proposed, most authorities agree that in the early Holocene Great

Plains boreal forests were rapidly replaced by grasslands. Identified charcoal deposited ¢.9500 B.P. at

the Allen site in western Nebraska suggests that immediate post-glacial vegetation history was more

complex. Along with other identified taxa, the presence of red mulberry (Morus rubra) 250 miles west

of its modern distribution suggests that a brief (c. 500-1000 years) interval of deciduous forest may

have existed between boreal and grassland stages. The mulberry also strengthens previous portrayals

of this period as relatively cool and/or moist.

[42] PRE-VILLAGE ALPINE LAND-USE IN THE WHITE MOUNTAINS, CALIFORNIA
Systematic survey in alpine areas of the White Mountains of California identified 385 prehistoric

sites, thirteen of which were partially excavated. Site distribution, site structure, and lithic assemblage

composition data allow an analysis of high altitude subsistence and settlement prior to Rosegate

times. The analysis indicates that Elko and Little Lake period hunter-gatherers logistically exploited

alpine resources from low altitude base camps. These logistic task groups specifically targeted mam-

mal! rather than plant resources. The relevance of these results are discussed in light of current

evolutionary models of resource use and transport costs in the Great Basin.

[22] IMAGE PROCESSING: AN ALTERNATIVE TECHNIQUE FOR IDENTIFYING THE
PROVENIENCE OF PREHISTORIC CERAMICS FROM CHODISTAAS, EAST-CENTRAL
ARIZONA

Current research on production and exchange of prehistoric ceramics demands that archacologists
adopt accurate and efficient techniques for identifying sources of pottery manufacture. The combined
application of image processing and scanning electron microscopy to polish thin sections provides
simultaneous petrographic characterization, sedimentological information, and extensive areal point
counting of mineral inclusions in ceramics. Use of these methods for identifying local vs. nonlocal
ceramics from Chodistaas, East-central Arizona, demonstrate that image processing is a powerful
alternative to manual point counting using a polarized microscope. Acquisition of detailed mineralogi-

[72] RECON JOHN SHELTER AND THE ARCHAIC-WOODLAND TRANSITION IN EASTERN
COLORADO
Recon John Shelter (5PE648) is located in the Colorado Piedmont in the high plains—foothills |
transition zone. Cultural deposits 2.5 m thick represent three radiocarbon-dated components: Middle
Archaic period (ca. 4,400-3,700 B.P.}, Late Archaic period (2,00—-1,800 B.P.), and Early Ceramic (Wood-
land) period (1,800—1,000 B.P.). A Hunting-gathering subsistence economy, supplemented with maize
beginning in the Late Archaic period, is evident. Subsistence pursuits and technologies changes little
over the prolonged period of occupation. Analysis of artifactual and nonartifactual remains, combined
with geomorphic investigations, indicates that a remarkably stable long-term adaptation is repre-
sented by the site.
