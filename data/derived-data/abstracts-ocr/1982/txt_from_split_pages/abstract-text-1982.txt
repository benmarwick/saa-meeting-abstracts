ABSTRACTS OF SYMPOSIA
(1) UNDERSTANDING PREHISTORIC SETT LEMENT-SUBSISTENCE IN WESTCENTRAL IL-
LINOIS., This symposium presents current research on aspects of prehistoric settlement-subsis-
tence in westcentral Illinois, a region which includes the lower Illinois River valley and part of the
central Mississippi River valley. Topically, these papers range from biological assessments of
the health of prehistoric populations to resource exploitation and site formation processes. Infor-
mation used in these papers comes from the now-active F.A.P. 408 Central Illinois Expressway
project, but also included are studies accumulated during 25 years of archaeology conducted by
Northwestern University and the Kampsville Archeological Center. Several papers, notably those
on geomorphology, paleozoology, paleobotany, and bioanthropology, are overviews documenting
change and continuity in the prehistory of this region. The other papers are more narrowly fo-
cused on certain aspects of prehistoric settlement-subsistence and are frequently chronological-
ly specific.
(2) BRIDGING THE ATLANTIC: MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS IN LATE PLEISTOCENE CULTURE
HISTORY, AND ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES TO THE EXPLANATION OF CULTURE CHANGE.
This symposium frames a discussion of American and European archaeological approaches to
the study of culture change. Despite recent communication, an explicit examination of the
theoretical and methodological underpinnings of these approaches has yet to be forthcoming.
The papers involved address the theoretical orientation and associated methodologies used in
addressing culture change questions, thereby providing an innovative base for new research, One
particular aspect involves the incorporation of social variables into archaeological models, with a
discussion of the American processual school, and European paleoeconomy and marxist ap-
proaches. The session is divided into two sections: the first involves alternative interpretations of
culture historical developments; the second addresses explanatory approaches.
(3) ARCHAEOLOGY IN NORTHERN BELIZE. Significant progress has taken place in Maya ar-
chaeology over the last 25 years. Especially noteworthy is the variety of research in northern
Belize, particularly that of the past decade. The symposium provides several project summaries
as well as topical discussions concerning northern Belize. Chronological sequences of artifacts
begin with non-Maya materials ca. 9000 BC, and continue well into the various Maya periods end-
ing in the Late Postclassic (17th century). Thus, a capsule view of prehistoric northern Belize is
made available via the cooperation and communication among the various archaeological proj-
ects of the region.
(4) THE MEANING OF ARCHITECTURAL VARIABILITY AND SPACE USE, This symposium is con-
cerned with the development of methods to determine the meaning of architectural variability
and site structure in the archaeological record. Papers focus on the relationships between inter-
site and intrasite structure and social organization, labor organization, symbolism, subsistence
activities and space use. Many potential ways to approach an understanding of this architectural
_and site structural variability are presented, including ethnoarchaeology, behavioral studies, the
development of cross cultural measures, cognition models and dimensional analyses. These
papers relate current ideas in anthropology to the archaeological domain and consider the
* relative usefulness of the various approaches.
(5) CHANGE AND STABILITY IN THE HOHOKAM CULTURAL SYSTEM: SALT-GILA AQUEDUCT,
CENTRAL ARIZONA PROJECT, ARCHAEOLOGY. The Salt-Gila Aqueduct Project provides an op-
portunity to reexamine change in Hohokam cultural system, and in particular the transition to the
Classic Period. It has often been proposed that external factors forced radical change at about
AD 1100. Our data suggest Hohokam modification of social and economic strategies not in
response to stress but to develop and perpetuate important elements of the existing system.
Evidence of Preclassic economic and social complexity and local diversity, as well as new data
regarding the appearance of “Classic’’ characteristics and the survival of “Preclassic”’
characteristics, demonstrates continuity in the development of the Hohokam.
(6) CULTURAL AND BIOLOGICAL CHANGE AT THE MIDDLE TO UPPER PALEOLITHIC TRANSI-
TION. The last major cultural and biological transition in human evolution was the development
of the Upper Paleolithic from the Middle Paleolithic and the contemporaneous evolution of the
Neanderthals into modern-appearing humans. The papers in this symposium will discuss the
nature and adaptive significances of this transition, or its equivalent, in regions of Africa, the
Near East and Europe. They will draw upon artifactual, faunal, human paleontological and con-
textual data to provide an overall characterization of the origins of modern human behavioral pat-
terns from the more archaic ones of the early Upper Pleistocene.
(11) AMERICAN BOTTOM ARCHAEOLOGY: RESULTS OF THE FAI-270 ARCHAEOLOGICAL MITI-
GATION PROJECT. Archaeological research in the American Bottom has centered on the
24
_- ee
, (19) Environments and Extinctions 25
Cahokia site. The Federal Aid Interstate highway 270 provided an opportunity to explore 82 sites
along a 34 km sample of floodplain. The research design emphasized an excavation strategy
aimed at the recovery of prehistoric community plans. With the exception of Cahokian Mississip-
pian occupations, little excavated data was available for any other time period. This symposium
will present the results of analysis for occupations from the late Archaic through Oneota. New
data and interpretations dealing with bioanthropology, paleoethnobotany, archaeozoology, and
geomorphology will be presented.
(13) TOWARDS A GENERAL THEORY OF HUNTER-GATHERER TECHNOLOGY: EFFICIENCY
AND ECONOMIZING STRATEGIES. Archeological theory explaining the variability in hunter-gath-
erer technology is notably lacking. The papers in this symposium are an attempt to explain pat-
terns of resource procurement, manufacture, use and discard among prehistoric hunter-gather-
ers. Two broad topics are considered: the role of scheduling as a result of constraints on
available time (efficiency) and technological response to constraints on preferred raw materials
(economy). A wide geographic and temporal range of data is used in testing hypotheses about ef-
ficient and economic behavior in hunter-gatherers.
(14) CRM: MANAGING THE RESOURCE. Discussions on cultural resource management generally
have focused on the laws and excavation work performed. The other aspect, preservation of the
resource, is rarely discussed. However, simply saving a site from the bulldozers is not enough;
natural elements, pot hunters and privately funded projects can still destroy a site. Preservation
must involve management—cultural resource management. This symposium will focus on prob-
lems of preservation and some methods and approaches being taken to manage our dwindling
resources.
(15) RECENT DEVELOPMENT IN HOHOKAM ARCHAEOLOGY. Recent work in Hohokam ar-
chaeology has forced a reevaluation of preexisting schemes of time measurement, site definition
and interpretation which have affected the way archaeologists investigate culture change.
Primarily these changes are due to an expanded knowledge of the range of variability between
and within Hohokam sites. Papers presented treat data on both inter- and intrasite scales for
defining changes in the demographics and sociopolitical system of the Hohokam. Of general in-
terest to archaeologists are the discussions of theoretical aspects of rates of change, causes of
change, and of the relation of material patterning to prehistoric behavior.
(16) NATIONAL PARK SERVICE ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE MIDWESTERN UNITED STATES. The
National Park Service has sponsored or conducted a wide range of archaeological investigations
in the midwestern United States during the last four years. These studies have emphasized com-
pliance with historic preservation legislation within a research oriented framework. The papers in
this symposium represent a diverse range of topics relating to historic and prehistoric ar-
chaeology throughout the midwest, including survey, site testing, large scale data recovery and
reanalysis of data from previous investigations. The papers contribute individually, and collec-
tively, to a better understanding of midwestern archaeology.
(17) UNPUBLISHED ARTIFACTS FROM THE CENOTE OF SACRIFICE, CHICHEN ITZA,
YUCATAN, MEXICO. This symposium will discuss and illustrate those categories of artifacts
dredged from the Cenote between 1904 and 1907 that are stored in the Peabody Museum, Harvard
University, and have never been published as a collection. These include over 700 textile
fragments, basketry, about 100 wooden objects, worked stone—both chipped and ground, marine
materials, bone artifacts, whole ceramic vessels and associated copal, rubber, gourds and other
vegetal materials. This collection will be compared with another removed from a cenote at
Dzibilchaltun, Yucatan to provide an analogous, if probably not contemporary, ritual situation.
Other reports will discuss the various conclusions deriving from techniques of physical and
theoretical analysis that have been applied to this artifactual collection which is central to an
understanding of the Postclassic Maya.
(18) CURRENT RESEARCH IN AFRICA AND THE LEVANT: COMPARISONS AND CORRELA-
TIONS. Recent field work in Africa and the Levant has led to a reassessment of long-held inter-
pretations about prehistoric adaptive strategies and cultural development. These papers focus
on regions where new evidence has particularly influenced this reevaluation. The emergence of
African cattle pastoralism, early cereal domestication, the regional development of Upper
| Paleolithic technologies and the spatial organization of prehistoric populations in several areas
are among the topics critically examined. Since Africa and the Levant contain much of the
earliest evidence for appearance of historically significant Cultural advances, these papers offer
| new bases for modeling the processes through which they appeared.
(19) ENVIRONMENTS AND EXTINCTIONS: MAN IN LATE GLACIAL NORTH AMERICA. In recent
years there has been a marked increase in the interest and understanding of man’s adaptation to
the Late Glacial environments of North America. Recognizing this, the symposium will examine
, 26 (19) Environments and Extinctions
Late Pleistocene environments, and the causes and consequences of Late Pleistocene extinc-
tlons. Under the broader issue of environments, papers will be presented that deal with problems
of environmental reconstruction, taphonomy, dating and man/environment relations. Under the
more specific issue of extinctions, papers will focus on the question of man’s impact on the
vertebrate fauna of North America.
(24) ADVANCES IN OBSIDIAN HYDRATION DATING. Symposium sponsored by the Society for
Archaeological Sciences. Symposium followed by an address by Irwin Scollar.
(28) CURRENT RESEARCH AND TRENDS IN NORTH SLOPE ARCHAEOLOGY. In recent years,
research on Alaska’s North Slope has responded to the increasing pace of industrial develop-
ment and changing land ownership. increasingly, archaeologists are placed in the forefront of
controversy, amidst questions of native land use, cultural values and data inventory and salvage.
As a result of these trends, significant advances have been made in our understanding of this
vast and poorly-understood region. Although work continues to grapple with persistent problems
of cultural history, much of the current research has attempted to resolve some of the more com-
plex processual problems inherent in regional syntheses and interpretation.
(29) CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS. This
symposium addresses cultural resource management in the Corps of Engineers. Actions under-
taken by and under the jurisdiction of the Corps affect a wide range of cultural resources requir-
ing management programs which are both innovative and multifaceted. The papers presented
deal with a variety of administrative, theoretical and methodological approaches from the
perspective of agency archaeologist and contractor. A historic overview will provide background
information. Specific projects are utilized as focal points for discussions of contracting pro-
cedures, agency coordination, integrated research designs and management studies.
(30) CURRENT PROBLEMS IN THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF COASTAL ECUADOR. This symposium
presents previously unreported recent and ongoing research on the coast of Ecuador. Each paper
deals with a major topic within a specific period and area. The important north and central
coasts, until now virtually unexplored and unreported, are represented by two papers, one
discussing a complex Valdivia site on the north coast, the other describing a large Mantefio in-
stallation on the central coast. The other papers present data and research done in Guayas Pro-
vince on the south coast.
(31) THE SOCIO-POLITICS OF ARCHAEOLOGY. This symposium will view archaeology as a
social institution which enculturates Its members to interact in structured ways with its
academic and sociopolitical context. As an institution, archaeology Is forced to serve the goals
of the larger society which supports it while it also mirrors the norms, prejudices, politics and
economic structure of that society. From this perspective, we will consider the extent to which ar-
chaeological developments are shaped by the values and contradictions in the larger society,
how our interpretations support or undermine ideological beliefs and how societal roles and
ranks affect professional relationships among archaeologists.
.
(32) URBAN ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE UNITED STATES. This symposium explores certain ongoing
urban archaeological projects in the United States. The number of methodological and
theoretical advances, and the amount of substantive information, have grown rapidly in recent
years. Topics discussed include the contributions urban archaeology can make and has made to
the understanding of urban development, ethnicity and other historic issues, the formation of ur-
ban sites and the preservation of the archaeological record in urban settings, and the relevance
of urban archaeology in today’s urban world.
(33) NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOPICS: AN INITIAL FORMULATION. As a
method of establishing priorities for the expenditure of federal and other funds on archaeological
data recovery, the development of National Archaeological Research Topics has recently been
under discussion among several federal agencies responsible for segments of the national
historic preservation effort. This symposium will consider the need for such topics, and how the
federal data recovery program could be organized around them, and will present several
preliminary examples of what such topics might be.
(34) THE LANGE/FERGUSON (39SH33) CLOVIS KILL-BUTCHERY SITE: OF MEN, MAMMOTHS
AND MICE. The site represents the first substantiated evidence of Clovis hunters in direct
association with butchered bones of mammoth and other megafauna in the Dakotas. Several
lines of evidence, both taphonomic and artifactual (human) exist to corroborate the incidence of
killing and butchering activity at the Lange/Ferguson (39SH33) Site. Ecological and climatic im-
plications of the late Wisconsin/early Holocene as they affected the prehistoric hunters and
megafauna are considered through the recovered vertebrate fossils, fossil mollusks and
reconstructed geologic and soil data at the site.
, (45) The Meadowcroft Rockshelter 7
(35) LITHIC TECHNOLOGY IN THE LATE PLEISTOCENE. Previous symposia and edited volumes
devoted to lithic technology have tended to omit temporal or environmental restrictions on the
assemblages represented. The present symposium is intended to bring together investigators
concerned with such studies as they relate Pleistocene cultures. Speakers will address topics in-
cluding use wear, reconstitution analysis, intersite spatial distribution of tools and debitage,
silica residues on stone tools and inferences concerning prehistoric motor habits. While it is
primarily devoted to North American Paleoindians, particularly the northeast, Old World topics
are included in order to stimulate dialogue on relevant issues.
(36) PEER POLITY INTERACTION AND SOCIOPOLITICAL CHANGE. The unifying concept is peer
polity interaction defined in the initial paper by Renfrew. Each contributor takes a specific in-
stance of sociocultural change generally of increased complexity where peer polity interaction is
a crucial process. The cases discussed by Cherry and Wright involve initial state formation,
Barnes, Braun and the Champions consider changes to a level of complexity perhaps below that
of the state; Shennan, an instance at a lower organizational level. Both Sabloff and Hodges con-
sider changes in the aftermath of state collapse or recession. The geographical range is wide to
initiate a dialogue towards coherent generalization.
(37) STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL DATA STRUCTURES. Application of an
analytical technique to data can yield accurate and pertinent results only if the assumptions
which the technique makes about the structure of the data are logically consistent with the em-
pirical structure of the data and its expectable structure based upon some guiding theoretical
framework. The importance of bridging data, technique, and theory is stressed by papers which:
(a) describe the nature of various kinds of archaeological data, (b) evaluate the assumptions
made by commonly-used analytical techniques, (c) introduce new techniques having assump-
tions more consistent with the structure of archaeological data and (d) describe data screening
methods for bringing data and technique into concordance. Spatial analysis, lithic analysis,
regional exchange and areal sampling are the specific areas of application.
(40) THE SMALL-SCALE SURVEY REVISITED. In 1978, at the SAA meeting in Tucson, a sym-
posium was held which focused on the problems and integration of small-scale archaeological
surveys. Today's symposium offers an opportunity for up-to-date discussion regarding the
philosophical, methodological, technological and managerial problems presented in 1978.
Representatives of state and federal agencies, as well as industry and private interests, offer a
broad range of response to questions previously raised. Although polemic points of view become
apparent, they can only serve to encourage the kinds of debate and discussion that will bring
about adequate and timely solutions to problems of the small-scale archaeological survey.
(41) INDUSTRY AND ARCHAEOLOGY, Archaeological meetings are generally characterized by ar-
chaeologists talking to other archaeologists. In this symposium, representatives of a number of
key industries who deal with archaeologists explain the needs of their programs and what they
need from archaeologists in order to expedite their own work schedules and mission goals. The
key participants are representatives of the oil and gas, utility (siting and routing) and highway
construction industries.
(43) IDEOLOGY AND THE ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD. The aim of this session is to investigate
the relationship between ideology and material culture. ideologies can either help to make the
world known to people or they may serve to mask the actual nature of extant social relations and
legitimate the interests of specific groups or individuals. This has important implications for the
interpretation of material culture because artifacts can be used both to represent, misrepresent
and represent and misrepresent simultaneously. All the papers (whether theoretical,
. ethnographic or archaeological) in this session work towards a clearer conception of the relation-
ship between the meanings of social actions and the uses of material culture.
(44) THE BIOGEOGRAPHY OF THE BLACK MESA ANASAZI. Numerous environmental, ecofac-
tual, osteological, artifactual and settlement pattern analyses have been conducted with data
collected by the Black Mesa Archaeological Project in northeastern Arizona since 1968. The
results of these analyses are integrated to present a complete description of environmental and
cultural change on prehistoric Black Mesa. Further, models that predict the interrelationships
among environmental perturbation, changing resource availability, nutritional responses,
demographic change and organizational responses to these changes are evaluated.
(45) THE MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER ROLLING THUNDER REVIEW: LAST ACT. From 1973
fo present, the Department of Anthropology, University of Pittsburgh, has conducted
multidisciplinary research into the prehistory, paleoecology, geology and geomorphology of
Meadowcroft Rockshelter (36WH297) and the Cross Creek drainage of Washington County,
southwestern Pennsylvania, These studies have produced an enormous data base that is in the
final stages of scrutiny at the University of Pittsburgh and at a series of cooperating institutions
, 28 (45) The Meadowcroft Rockshelter
in the United States. The data indicate that Meadowcroft Rockshelter and the Cross Creek water-
shed were utilized aboriginally from ca. 14-17,000 BC and extending into the Historic Period. Ad-
ditionally, data exist to detail the geomorphological history of both the rockshelter and the
drainage as well as the vicissitudes of the floral and faunal record.
(50) PREHISTORIC PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTS: CLUES FOR THEIR INTERPRETATION. In re-
cent years archaeologists have recruited geologists to reconstruct the physical environment of a
particular research area. Archaeologists usually request a specific product, i.e., a regional pic-
ture of the natural resources available to prehistoric people. But geologists traditionally
reconstruct past geomorphic settings at an areal and temporal scale unacceptably large for ar-
chaeological purposes. This symposium, which attempts to acquaint archaeologists with the
geologist's perspective and demonstrate the potential of geologic research, should enhance
communication between the two disciplines. Each paper, focusing on a physical setting often
associated with prehistoric sites, will include a discussion of the data needed to reconstruct the
environment, approaches to data interpretation, and a caution regarding their limitations.
(52) INNOVATIONS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL APPLIGATIONS OF REMOTE SENSING, AERIAL
PHOTOGRAPHY, AND GROUND-BASED PHOTOGRAMMETRY. Recent innovations in ar-
chaeological use of remote sensing, vertical and oblique aerial photography, and ground-based
stereophotogrammetry are described. Practicality, cost effectiveness, reliability and limitations
are explored. The place of such techniques within general archaeological practice is emphasized.
Connections between the various technical methodologies are detailed. Integrated systems of
photography, interpretation, and metrics are discussed and some nonmetric uses of ar-
chaeological photography are considered. Emphasis is upon the feasibility of archaeological
photography, including high-technology imaging, as an information gathering method for ar-
chaeological research.
(64) ARCHAEOLOGISTS AND CONSERVATORS: THE PRESERVATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
COLLECTIONS. The preservation, storage and curation of archaeological materials is of vital im-
portance to contemporary and future archaeologists. With the aid of modern technology and
trained conservators, archaeological materials can be stabilized, preserved and stored for future
study. However, many archaeologists do not take advantage of the possibilities in conservation,
and many artifacts are being damaged or lost because of this lack. The discussion of conserva-
tion from the archeologists’ and the conservators’ point of view will be aimed at practical solu-
tions, and will discuss several cases.
, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS

Abbott, David R. (Arizona State Museum) VARIABILITY IN REDWARE MANUFACTURE AMONG
THE HOHOKAM. Issues about the origin and development of Hohokam redwares have been
debated for many years. The Salt-Gila Aqueduct project has dramatically expanded the
assemblage of Hohokam redwares, shedding new light on several issues. The morphological and
contextual variability of the redwares from several Sedentary and Classic Period sites are anal-
yzed to address questions concerning redware origins among the Hohokam, their loci of
manufacture, and the temporal sensitivity of particular redware attributes. (5)

Adams, E. Charles (Museum of Northern Arizona) CULTURE CHANGE AMONG THE HOP! AND
ITS REFLECTION IN THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT. Patterns in the built environment of the Hopi In-
dians have changed dramatically during the past century. These changes are due to contact with
Euro-American culture. Patterns at both the household and the community level have shifted from
the traditional western Pueblo pattern characteristic through the mid-19th century to one nearly
identical to the dominant Euro-American culture. The evolution of this change and underlying
social and economic factors are traced. (4)

Adams, G. Robert (Michigan Department of Highways and Transportation) THE HIGHWAY IN-
DUSTRY. Archaeologica! investigations undertaken as a part of the highway construction process
are required to meet the specific needs of the industry. This paper will include a discussion of the
objectives of the agencies responsible for highway construction, the means by which these ob-
jectives are accomplished and the role of archaeology in this process. Examples of problems
resulting from the failure of archaeologists to understand these needs are presented as illusta-
tions. The paper concludes with recommendations to archaeologists on how they can better
serve the needs of the agencies responsible for highway construction. (41)

Adams, Richard E. W. (Texas, San Antonio) THE ORIGINS OF MAYA CIVILIZATION IN N. BELIZE:
PRESENT EVIDENCE. A long and precocious sequence of development in Belize begins ca. 2600
BC and culminates in Classic Maya civilization by 250 AD. Farming villages appear by 2600 BC.
Small ceremonial centers seem to be in existence by 1500 BC. By 1000 BC many of the later
features of Classic Maya civilization are already developing, together with the implied ritual and
social structure based on genealogical prestige. Huge temples are built at Cerros and Lamanai in
the Late Preclassic. Specialized sites appear in the same period, including a port and a stone tool
factory. Intensive farming in the form of drained fields and canals are extant. Rank order and rank
size analysis of 17 centers from the period see to reflect political and economic hierarchies. Ex-
planatory factors are examined. (3)
Adovasio, J. M. (Pittsburgh), J. Donahue (Pittsburgh), K. Cushman (Dravo) and J. D. Gunn (San An-
tonio) PALEOENVIRONMENTAL RECONSTRUCTION AT MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER,
WASHINGTON COUNTY, PENNSYLVANIA. Systematic collection and extensive floral, faunal,
geological, geomorphological and sedimentological analysis of samples between 1973 and the
present have delineated the local paleoenvioronment of Meadowcroft Rockshelter and the Cross
Creek drainage in the Upper Ohio Valley. Floral remains are present in the site's deposits
throughout the entire 16,000-19,000 year occupational sequence. Faunal remains from the
post-9500 BC levels to the uppermost levels of the site are also extensive. These data indicate
that despite “low-level” fluctuations, the climatic setting at the site has remained more or less
stable since ca. 9000 BC. An environment not substantially dissimilar to that of today is seen to
; extend into the terminal Pleistocene. This interpretation is also supported by the wide range of
geological analyses employed. The methodology of data collection at Meadowcroft is detailed,
and the utility of these methods in paleoenvironmental reconstruction is summarized. (19)
Adovasio, J. M. (Pittsburgh), J. Donahue (Pittsburgh), J. D. Gunn (Texas/San Antonio), R.
Stuckenrath (Smithsonian) THE MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER/CROSS CREEK ARCHAEO-
LOGICAL PROJECT: RETROSPECT 1982. The 1973-1978 excavations and attendant analyses at
Meadowcroft Rockshelter as well as the concomitant survey, excavations and ancillary studies
conducted elsewhere in the Cross Creek drainage have generated what is believed to be the most
detailed data base of its kind extracted to date from an area of comparable size and antiquity of
occupation anywhere in the world. The information processed at this writing conclusively in-
dicates that Meadowcroft Rockshelter and the Cross Creek drainage were initially visited or
utilized by at least 14,000 BC and perhaps 17,000 BC. Human occupation throughout the drainage
persists into the Historic period. The archaeological sequence at the rockshelter and in the
drainage are summarized within the geological, geomorphological, floral and faunal framework in
| which it occurred, and the results of the project are assessed in terms of the prehistory of
| southwestern Pennsylvania and in progressively broader perspectives, the Upper Ohio Valley,
northeastern and eastern North America and ultimately the New World. (45)

Aigner, Jean S. (University of Alaska-Fairbanks) LAND USE ACTIVITIES IN THE MOSQUITO LAKE/

ATIGUN AREA OF NORTHERN ALASKA. A review of archaeological sites in the Mosquito

Lake/Atigun River archaeological district of northern Alaska indicates repeated use over time by

prehistoric and historic native peoples. Several different aspects of the subsistence and land-use

systems of these groups may be suggested from the locational data, features and artifactual re-

mains. The northwestern part of Alaska is relatively resource-poor today. Are periods of increased

human activity relatable to environmental cycles which may have affected resource availability
here (or in adjacent areas) and made the Mosquito Lake/Atigun River region more attractive? (28)
Akins, Nancy J. (National Park Service) FAUNAL EXPLOITATION IN CHACO CANYON, NEW
MEXICO. Six years of identification and analysis of over 50,000 elements from recent National
Park Service excavations in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico, has enabled us to address faunal ex-
ploitation patterns in both town and village sites over the history of Anasazi occupation. Special
attention was paid to determining the seasonality of both individual deposits and the sites
themselves. A methodology was employed which has lead to the conclusion that large quantities
of dried meat may have been returned to the sites without leaving physical remains. This, in con-
junction with changes in the utilization of small mammals, presents a more complete picture of
subsistence within Chaco Canyon. (25)

Aldenderfer, Mark S. (SUNY-Buffalo) REGIONAL RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND THE SMALL-
SCALE SURVEY. What happens to the results of the small-scale survey? The most likely out-
comes of these surveys seem to be neglect and burial in files. Actual use, especially in the con-
text of the magical regional research designs, appears to be infrequent at best and downright im-
possible at worst. If this is true, tremendous amounts of data are being wasted, One possible
solution to the problem is the enhancement of the role of the regional research institution as a
repository of the results of small-scale surveys and the research designs which can integrate
them into a useful data corpus. This solution, despite inevitable problems and failures in the past,
may become more attractive as cutbacks to Federal and state preservation programs become
more severe. Suggestions for both academicians and contract people are offered to help imple-
ment the solution. (40)

Alter, Laura and Robert K. Vierra (Northwestern) VARIABILITY, PERIODICITY AND DECISION-
MAKING IN DRY-LAND FARMING. The drought theory, invoked as an explanation for Anasazi
abandonment, has dominated southwestern archaeology for the last several decades. Data from
a recent study conducted on Squaw Point, a dry-land mesa community in southwestern Col-
orado, challenges this position from two directions: (1) its dependence on summer drought as the
single limiting factor; and (2) its incognizance of decision-making processes for coping with
microenvironmental variability. Squaw Point data demonstrate that successful crop management
‘obtains in spite of drought stress and a short growing season because agricultural decisions are
informed by ecological and cognitive variables. (25)
Altschul, Jeffrey H. (New World Research) BUG HILL: EXCAVATION OF A MULTI-COMPONENT
MIDDEN MOUND, CLAYTON LAKE, OKLAHOMA. The excavations at the Bug Hill site represent
the final stage of archaeological investigation of the Clayton Lake area prior to impoundment.
Under a contract with the Corps of Engineers, Tulsa District, New World Research conducted the
excavation during the fall of 1981. Preliminary results are presented, focusing especially on dif-
ferences found between identified living surfaces representing occupations from the Late Ar-
chaic through Late Choctaw. interpretations are offered on changes over time in subsistence
focus and lithic technologies as well as differential use of space. (29)
Anderson, Dana B. (New Mexico) and Robert Vierra (Northwestern) RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
SITE STRUCTURE AND LABOR AND SOCIAL ORGANIZATION. The purpose of this paper is to
construct a methodology through which anthropologists can measure organizational properties
of societies in the archaeological record. Both authors have independently carried out research
relating to the determinants of social organization. In the course of that research, correlations
between aspects of social and labor organization and site structure were recognized. For exam-
ple, ethnographic observations show a strong correlation between patriliny and dispersed settle-
ment systems. Cause and effect relationships that are responsible for such correlations are
delineated. These determinations are made through the use of the comparative ethnographic

record and specific case studies. (4)

Anderson. Duane C. (lowa) MODELS OF FREMONT CULTURE HISTORY: AN EVALUATION. The

Fremont culture was first identified by Noel Morss in 1931. Since that time the complex has been
, Asch, Nancy B. 31
redefined on several occasions and a number of different models of Fremont culture history have
been proposed. This paper examines the literature and discusses pre-1970 points of view regard-
ing the origin, development and disappearance of the Fremont culture. It then considers more re-
cent research noting conceptual problems that have resulted due to a shift in emphasis from
culture history to culture process, The paper concludes by presenting a composite model of Fre-
mont culture history intended to facilitate deductively oriented research. (56)
Andrews, R. L. (Pittsburgh) PERISHABLE ARTIFACTS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER,
WASHINGTON COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. Four classes of perishable ar-
tifacts were recovered from Meadowcroft Rockshelter (36WH297). These include basketry and
cordage as well as implements of bone and wood. Though relatively scarce, “perishables” occur
in all occupational strata at the site, notably including Stratum Ila. The analytical methods and
resultant typology for each of these artifact classes is detailed, and summary comments are of-
fered on the function or functions of each of these classes of items. Comparisons of each
perishable class to similar materials from elsewhere is also offered. (45)
Anzalone, Ronald D. (Advisory Council on Historic Preservation) SPACE: THE FINAL FRONTIER?
The idea that there is a relationship, albeit a complex one, between a society's social and
economic system and the conscious decisions that are made in constructing buildings, laying
out settlements, and “organizing” the surrounding environment provides the basis for a possible
National Archaeological Research Topic. How and why do settlements change? How can we ex-
plain such phenomena as territoriality, crowding, privacy, the connection between social interac-
tion and accessibility, the differing perceptions of space? Archaeologists can contribute their
own perspectives on change through time, preindustrial societies and cross-cultural comparison
in helping to explain the development of complex human spatial organization. (33)
Applegarth, J. D. (Illinois State Museum) and V. Cowin (Carnegie Museum) EXCAVATIONS AT
CROSS CREEK VILLAGE (36WH293) AND THE AVELLA MOUND (36WH415), WASHINGTON
COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. Cross Creek Village (36WH293) is a stratified,
multicomponent open site located on the narrow flood plain of Cross Creek, Washington County,
southwestern Pennsylvania. The site appears to be a seasonal habitation and lithic tool manufac-
turing locus, primarily utilizing local Monongahela chert. Late Archaic, Transitional and
Woodland cultural components have been noted, and very extensive technomorphological and
statistical analyses of these items have been undertaken. The Avella Mound (36WH415) is acom-
plex stone and earth burial mound dating ca. AD 750. It is located above Cross Creek at the north-
west corner of the town of Avella in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Prehistoric burial ac-
fvities at the site are reconstructed commencing with. a burning incident and continuing through
the building of a variety of circular burial cists (subsequently covered by an earth mantle) to the
subsequent introduction of intrusive burials. Excavated remains of 14 individuals are discussed,
and the site is compared to other simple and complex stone and stone and earth burial mounds in
the Ohio Valley. (45)

| Asch, David L. and Nancy B. Asch (Center for American Archeology) A CHRONOLOGY FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF PREHISTORIC HORTICULTURE IN WESTCENTRAL ILLINOIS. Since the
Gevelopment of flotation recovery methods during the early 1960s, carbonized plant remains have
been systematically collected and analyzed from many archaeological sites in westcentral ll-
mols. This paper presents an overview of the development of horticulture gained from this
record. It characterizes prehorticultural plant utilization and gives a chronology of some of the
significant horticultural developments. These include the appearance of squash by 7000 BP, the
Gomestication of Eastern seed plants no later than 4000 BP, the intensification of seed hor-
ticulture during Hopewetlian times (2000 BP) and the appearance and intensification of maize
horticulture (1500-1000 BP). (1)

Baar, Sam W. (Mesa Museum) POSTSEDENTARY HOHOKAM ARCHITECTURAL UNITS.
Postsedentary Hohokam architectural units are extremely variable. These units range from
above-ground structures to deep pithouses. Early investigators accounted for this variability by
invoking various migration models. Recent investigators have proposed various environmental
and/or developmental models. Data from two recent excavations and numerous older sites are ex-
amined with regard to architectural continuity/discontinuity. Available data suggest most of the
architectural units represent a continuation of earlier architectural forms, while some units cannot
be explained in terms of architectural development. (15)

Ball, J. W. (San Diego) THE CHRONOLOGY OF PUBLIC CEREMONIALISM AT EL CENOTE
SAGRADO, CHICHEN ITZA: A CERAMIC REASSESSMENT. Among the most spectacular foci of
pre-Cortesian ritual activities in the Maya area was the Sacred Cenote at Chichén Itza. Made
famous in the 16th century writings of deLanda, its repute as an offering place was tested by E. H.
Thompson-early in this century. A wealth of materials including abundant jade and gold exotica
rewarded his efforts, but the precise time of their deposition remained elusive. This paper ex-
amines ceramic data on this issue, concluding that the major era of ceremonialism predated the
traditionally-assigned Late Postclassic. (17)
Banks, Kimball M. (Southern Methodist) THE ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS GOVERNING
THE SPREAD OF CATTLE PASTORALISM IN THE SOUTHERN SAHARA. Stratigraphic, floral and
faunal data indicate that environmental conditions were more severe in the Egyptian Western
Desert than in the Central Sahara during the Holocene (ca. 12,000 to 4,000 BP). Domesticated cat-
tle, however, appeared some 2,000 years earlier in the former than the latter. The environmental
differences between the two areas suggest that domesticated cattle were adopted in the Egyp-
tian Western Desert as a hedge against periods of environmental stress. Cattle did not appear in
the Central Sahara until climatic conditins had deteriorated to the point where the more diver-
sified resource base could no longer be successtully exploited. (18)

Barber, Russell and Frank Hull (Harvard) OPTIMAL FORAGING THEORY AND HOHOKAM SUB-
SISTENCE. Hohokam subsistence is viewed by many as a series of responses to increasing crop
failure, population pressure and declining available moisture. This model is not supported by re-
cent Salt-Gila Aqueduct research. An economic structure is proposed based on optimal foraging
theory emphasizing environmental productivity and stability; specialization and generalization of
subsistence will be evaluated within the context of this body of theory. Important parts of the
Hohokam economic structure include a mode of production that utilized cultigens which were
genetically adapted to the southwestern environment and a technology and social organization
adept at adjusting to environmental and social changes in the Gila Basin for more than a millen-
nium and a half. This model suggests abundant rather than diminishing resources. (5)
Barnes, Gina Lee (Cambridge) PEER POLITY INTERACTION IN THE EAST ASIAN SPHERE. This
paper takes as a baseline the mention in Chinese dynastic chronicles of "many countries” ex-
isting in prehistoric Japan, a model is postulated whereby these “countries” are successively
grouped into hierarchical polities, creating a series of stages of “peer relations” with increasing-
ly larger and more hierarchical polities as the actors. Relations between these polities are
characterized by competition for continental iron and bronze mirror exchanges which reflect
political ordering and cosmological integration of the participants. The nature of these relations
and the material expressions of them will be examined during the 400-500 years before Japan
was unified under a single authority In the 7th century AD. (36)

landform type, which shows significant patterning. These data are unsupportive of Cook's (1976)
hypothesis of increasing dependence on upland resources during Titterington times. While

Region, Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, are experiencing cultural and commercial
revitalization. New construction in each city’s core is tearing away traces of earlier episodes of
urban development. Numerous investigators, most under contract, have sought to document and
explain elements of this vanishing evidence, with varying degrees of success. Yet prospects for
understanding cultural processes as they change from the 18th century to the present, remain
high. The use of archaeological techniques, and anthropological and sociological concepts in
historical perspective, may provide valuable insights for today's urban world. (32)

MACROECONOMY. Protohistoric (AD 1450-1700) interaction between Southwest and Southern

three subsystemic positions are present, including a core, periphery and semipheriphery. After
characterizing these positions, archaeological evidence (in the form of trade ceramics and obsi-
dian) from two archaeological sites in southwest Oklahoma, Edwards | (34BK2) and Taylor

Both beginning and end of the Middle Woodland Hopewellian developments have tended to be
explained by external” factors—the beginning by environmental change, or population pressure
Of aS a response to these technological and subsistence innovations; the end by population
pressure, either sheer numbers or pressure in the face of an inadequate or declining resource
base. It may well be that some or all of these factors are important, but if so they should be
regarded, not as external pressure on indigenous societies, but as internally derived. The main
. crive of this paper is to attempt a detailed analysis of Archaic and Middle Woodland
Sevelopments, with an emphasis on the internal dynamics and internal contradictions (maladap-
tation) that might help explain the changing social relations, changing demographic structures
and changing subsistence strategies. (2)

Semonstrates that volumetric differences exist. These can be attributed to differences in storage

The field of geoarchaeology has grown in its approach and application. Geological analyses of
archaeological assemblages provide new parameters within which to interpret prehistoric
cultural lifeways. Specifically, petrographic analysis of tempering agents in ceramics from the
Bronze age site of Bab-edh-Dhra, Jordan had yielded an objective classification of pottery types
which can be utilized in relation to the more classical methods of ceramic typology. Finally, this
geoarchaeological analysis has shed new light on manufacturing techniques, trade and the iden-

Biddick, Kathleen (Inst. Research in History) FROM COMPLEX CHIEFDOMS TO FEUDAL
SOCIETIES: TOWARDS DEVELOPING MODELS FOR SOCIAL CHANGE IN NORTHWESTERN
EUROPE (300 BC-AD 800). Over the last decade, archaeologists have strived for coherence in
describing the complex social systems in core areas of northwestern Europe in the first
millenium BC. Unfortunately, the complex pre-feudal societies of the first milienium AD are still
largely perceived as terminologies of a traditional historiography: (1) ethnicity (Germans), (2)
ideology (barbarians) and (3) 19th century ethnographic constructs (tribes). A growing body of ar-
chaeological data and archaeological reading of contemporary texts encourage alternative
characterizations. A model of complex chiefdoms evolving into simple state systems will be
outlined for these societies and illustrated by examples of the Merovingians, Mercians and
Danes. (9)

Birkedal, Terje G. (National Park Service) BASKETMAKER III RESIDENCE UNITS. Taking primary
guidance from Harner’s theory of social avolution, the proposition is explored that the Basket-
maker tll Anasazi retained an archaic form of residential grouping—namely the minimal sub-
sistence band. Because the settlement provides 4 spatial master plan of residential social
organization, the individual Basketmaker dwellings and their arrangement in the larger communi-
ty offer the best source ot information for examining the validity of the above proposition.
Analysis of the data from Mesa Verde shows that Basketmaker Ill settlements were characterized
by a high degree of intra-settlement variation in household architecture and extremely irregular
community layouts. It is argued that these findings strongly support the contention that Basket-
maker Ill settlements were typically occupied by a “settled down” version of the minimal band. (4)

Blakey, Michael L. (Massachusetts-Amherst) A MACROSCOPIC VIEW OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
BEHAVIOR. This paper concerns several macroscopic social processes influencing patterns of
archaeological research. Survey data show ethnically, economically and politically related
trends. The Judeo-Christian “roots” of Euro-American and Western European archaeologists
dominate research interests when special proximity is controlled; unlike Eastern Europeans who,
although more proximate to the Middle East, claim different, materialistic origins for their na-
tional and cultural development. A generational analysis of archaeologists shows that they are
“coming home" regionally. This trend relates to international political and economic change.
Domestic (American) political and economic change appears to encourage 4 temporal
“homecoming” as well, toward historical archaeology. Examples are used to show the special
susceptability of that branch of archaeology to manipulation in political, economic and
ideological interests of private and government funding agencies. (31)

CHAEOLOGICAL PROJECT IN NORTHERN OHIO. The post-AD 500 culture history of the San
Gusky Bay drainage is now relatively well understood, but it presents a complex processwal prob
tem. Prior to AD 1300 the region was inhabited by two Late Woodland groups, one adapted to the
uplands, the other to the lower riverine area. After that date, research shows that both groups
abandoned the region, which was later reoccupied by at least one village group budding off from

Bower, John R. F. (lowa State) ORIGINS OF DIVERSITY IN EAST AFRICAN PASTORALISM. One
of the most striking contrasts between East African pastoralists and those of other regions is the
relative heterogeneity of the former. Archaeological data suggest that diversity has been a more
or less persistent feature of East African pastoralism for at least 3,000 years. Although the varied
environments of the region have influenced diversity in livestock management, settlement prac-
thoes, etc., other factors have also been important. in particular, East Africa's role as a refugium
for ecologically stressed cultures from the grazing lands on the southern fringes of the Sahara
may have contributed strongly to the development of pastoral heterogeneity. (18)

relating to the refinement of a North Slope culture history. Excavated assemblages often resist
wrambiguous ascription within established sequences. It is argued that the relative abundance
of two resources, chert and caribou, have tended to homogenize the Holocene archaeological
record in the area. Complexities of interpretation of North Slope prehistory are discussed in
terms of spatial contexts, site definition, dating, seasonality, raw material availability,
mechanics of tool manufacture and use, taxonomy and the nature of coastal-interior subsistence

tensively exploited for the production and capture of food as well as for construction of utilitarian

contributions to our understanding of early urbanism and states. In 1979 a sample of 21 rooms
was excavated in the Middle Horizon 1B architectural unit of Moraduchayuc at Huari. The ar-
chitecture of the unit is similar to the planned architectural complexes associated with the ex-

to examine the relationships among ethnicity, socioeconomic class, behavior and material

widespread interest by archaeologists and the newsworthy nature of the site were instrumental
in obtaining testing funds, but interest lessened when the very old dates reported for the site were
found to be in error. The structure of the agency does not facilitate dealing with special ar-

materials often provides valuable complimentary data to the analysis of tool assemblages and
on-site activities. A simple classificatory scheme is applied to debitage from a diverse set of Ar-
chaic sites in southern Iilinois and western Kentucky. A comparison of these data sets reveals a

Meadowcroft Rockshelter. The overall goal of this multidisciplinary research project was the
elucidation of the geology, geomorphology, floral, faunal, climatological, achaeological and
historical record of this watershed in as great detail as possible. The modern setting of the

Carmichael, David L. (Illinois) FRESNEL SHELTER, NEW MEXICO: PRELIMINARY DATING AND
EVIDENCE FOR EARLY CULTIGENS. Initial small scale analysis of materials excavated from
Fresnel Shelter, New Mexico, is underway. The site will provide much needed temporal control for
Archaic materials in the region. Of particular interest is the presence of corn and beans in early
levels of the occupation. The data on early cultigens will be of interest to researchers concerned
with the spread of agriculture in the Southwest. In addition, the deposits as a whole provide con-
siderable data for reconstructing the overall Archaic subsistence Strategy of the area. (25)

cultural resources. The research results have been used extensively in the planning process for
the eight individual Inupiaq villages and for the Borough as whole. Academic research, whether
sponsored by the Borough or another entity, will continue to aid the Borough in planning the
future for the Inupiaq people. (28)
Carr, Christopher (Arkansas) DISSECTING INTRA-SITE ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTIONS AS PALIMP.
SESTS. Trend surface analysis, spatial filtering or Fourier analysis and spectral analysis, can be
used to partition the variability of some single, continuous, site-wide variable reflecting intra-site
artifact arrangement into multiple components representing different archaeological formation
~processes that occurred in them. Different standard techniques of spatial analysis can then be
used within separate homogeneous strata, depending upon the characteristics of the strata and
the assumptions required by the techniques, to define tool kits and activity areas with logical
consistency between data and technique. (37)

Champion, Timothy and Sara Champion (Southampton) PEER POLITY INTERACTION IN THE
EUROPEAN IRON AGE. Interaction between communities at the same Stage of social develop-
ment is considered with reference to two periods of the Iron Age in Europe; the earlier saw the
emergence of more salient ranking, the latter the development of early states. Both phases are
characterized by the widespread and simultaneous appearance of certain features, especially of
art, prestige symbolism and ritual. It is suggested that these observations are best explained as
the result of emulation among competing societies, and that some innovations, such as coinage,
had profound effects on sociopolitical organization. (36)
Chang, Claudia (Sweet Briar) THE CONTRIBUTION OF ETHNOARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH
TO CHANGING PATTERNS OF LAND USE IN A GREEK VILLAGE. The value of ethnoar-
chaeological research on village pastoralists’ sites for developing models of economic and
social change in a traditional Greek village is explored. The assumptions of this approach are
that several sets of ethnoarchaeological data contribute to pastoral adaptation: (1) the special-
ized activity site as an artifact of past economic and social behaviors, (2) site locations as
markers of informal rights and access to pasture areas and (3) the history of site use as a docu-
ment of changing pastoral strategies over several generations. (12)
Chappell, Sylvia (Michigan) STONE AXE SIZES AND EXCHANGE PROCESSES IN NEOLITHIC
BRITAIN. The use of stone axe sizes to elucidate exchange processes in Neolithic Britain is
discussed. Attention is paid to the creation of the archaeological record and the resulting struc-
ture of the axe size data. This allows separation of smaller, discarded axes from larger, lost axes.
, Choyke, A. M. 39
Sizes of larger axes from known sources are used in a model of axe size decrease with increasing
exchange distance from the source, which further incorporates direction and allows identifica:
tion of trajectories of preferential axe exchange. Finally axe size data are used to test the
hypothesis of coastal movement of another group of axes. (20)
Charles, Douglas K. (Northwestern) SUBSISTENCE-SETTLEMENT IN WESTCENTRAL ILLINOIS:
CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF MORTUARY SITES. This study attempts to ex-
pand our understanding of Archaic and Woodland subsistence-settlement patterns through a
regional analysis of mortuary sites relating the spatial structure of the mortuary domain to cor-
porate organization. Data are drawn from published reports and unpublished material from
cemetery excavations and burial mound surveys. Evident patterns include regional variation in
resource competition during the Archaic, depopulation of the lower Illinois valley during Early
Woodland, the relationship of Middle Woodland status differentiation to repopulation and a shift
towards extended family economic organization during Late Woodland, culminating with
Mississippian maize agriculture. Diachronic analysis of prehistoric ritual systems is emphasized.

Chase, Diane Z. (Pennsylvania) GANN’ED BUT NOT FORGOTTEN: SANTA RITA, BELIZE. The in-
vestigations of the Corozal Postclassic Project focused on the site of Santa Rita during 1979 and
1980. Although work actively sought Postclassic Period deposits, earlier materials were also un-
covered in the course of excavation. An Early Preciassic presence was discovered in the south-
western portion of Santa Rita. The entire site manifests an Early Classic florescence not common
at other northern Belize sites. Analysis of the Postclassic remains recovered from Santa Rita has
led to new interpretations concerning the ethnohistoric and archaeological models generally put
forth for Postclassic settlement, trade and social organization. (3)
Chernoff, Miriam (Brandeis) EMPIRICAL BAYES ESTIMATION OF CERAMIC PROPORTIONS AT
TEOTIHUACAN. Archaeologists often confront the problem of estimating true proportions of
ceramics on the basis of small samples. Empirical Bayes estimation techniques may help to im-
prove the accuracy of such estimates in cases where many assemblages are being sampled and
it can be assumed that the population of assemblage proportions itself follows some known
distribution. One model assumes that true proportions are approximately normally distributed. A
second model uses a beta distribution. Where many of the individual samples are small, the beta
distribution should be more appropriate. Both models are investigated using Teotihuacan Mapp:
ing Project data. (37)
Cherry, John F. (Cambridge) PEERS, POLITIES AND PALACES: SOME PROBLEMS IN MINOAN
STATE FORMATION. Theories of state formation usually revolve around the themes of conflict or
cooperation. The concept of peer polity interaction partially overrides such distinctions by erm
phasizing that the high levels of interaction which initially serve to generate a shared community
of language, religion and culture among autonomous polities also provide the context for com
petitive processes which can lead to internal growth and differentiation. An examination of data
from Minoan Crete in this light shows that the concept focuses usefully on neglected questions
of symbolic and material interaction; but operational problems remain, especially concerning
units of analysis, rates of change and the demonstration of autonomy. (36)
Childs, S. Terry (Boston) REGIONAL CERAMIC VARIATION FROM CAPE COD, MASS. Preliminary
findings Involving regional and temporal variation of Early through Late Woodland ceramics ex-
cavated within the Cape Cod National Seashore, Massachusetts, will be presented. Ceramic
function, local need, frequency of use and the technological precision used in manufacture as
they relate to specific types of activity areas within the region and through time are basic ques-
tions pursued. Stylistic variation should provide clues concerning regional social organization
both synchronically and diachronically. The relatively low number of sherds for analysis requires
that all initial findings be treated as working hypotheses. (38)

potential problems resulting from the failure of archaeologists to understand industry needs are
used as illustrations. The paper concludes with recommendations to archaeologists on how they
can better serve the needs of the utility industry. (41)

Claassen, Chery! P. and Elizabeth A. Coughlin (Harvard) SILICIOUS AND MICROFOSSIL
RESIDUES ON STONE TOOLS: A NEW METHODOLOGY FOR IDENTIFICATION AND ANALYSIS.
We wish to introduce a new complementary methodology of microscopic analysis that provides
visual confirmation of the classification of OPAL-A and the detection of both characteristic
“swarms” indicative of short-range order and of “continuums” indicative of long range order of
the liquid crystal phase of amorphous silica (OPAL-A). It is this latter “continuum” phase that
precedes and eventually produces deposition on stone tools. This new microscopy technique re-
quires the use of a specifically developed lens system that includes a Zeiss planachromat 16X
objective with transmitted Normarski differential interference contrast. (35)

Coggins, Clemency C. (Harvard) WOODEN OBJECTS FROM THE CENOTE OF SACRIFICE. Ap-
proximately 100 wooden objects were dredged from the Cenote; these are unusual because so lit-
tle ancient wood has been preserved in Mesoamerica. They include 30 ceremonial batons:
manikin scepters, scythes (7), a nonfunctional Mexican Macuahuitil. Throwing sticks and
“gacrifical knives” with wooden handles were also found. Another category of objects is “idols";
these are crudely carved wooden forms that were once covered with decorative materials. The
various woods and associated adhesives are identified, and through wear analysis an attempt is
made to understand the ritual activity which culminated in breaking and burning most of the ob-
jects thrown into the Cenote, and the time frame in which it occurred. (17)
Cohen, Barbara E. (Southern I/linois) STYLE AND MESSAGE CONTENT AS MANIFESTED IN AR:
CHITECTURAL VARIABILITY. The author presents an explanatory model for stylistic behavior,
particularly architectural behavior, derived from communication theory and semiotics. Stylistic
attributes are defined as behavioral patterns or modes, which take their meaning from their
utilization within the cultural system. The cultural system has a “structure” which is roughly
- ... analogous to a grammar in verbal communication systems. While messages are continuously
emitted in visual signals, actual transmission-events occur only when received by a target in-
‘ dividual or group. Therefore, communication-events are marked by behavioral responses in the
target group which are potentially observable and interpretable archaeologically. (4)
Cole, John R. (Northern lowa) and M. T. Mulholland (Massachusetts-Amherst) CLIMATE AND
CULTURE IN WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS. Historic and prehistoric water availability and use
were examined. “Common knowledge” among regional archaeologists about water and land use
history was compared with 1836-1980 climate records; tree rings, ethnohistoric accounts of
water crises, flood records and demographic data were compared, testing the hypothesis that
they would correlate with each other. Instead, maximum precipitation and minimal flooding cor-
relate with maximum land abandonment in the 19th century and with historic accounts of max-
imal water crises. There are implications for both policy planning and archaeological method and
theory. (23)

Connor, Douglas R. (Southern Methodist) CATTLE PASTORALISM IN THE SAHARA: EVIDENCE
FOR A NEOLITHIC COMPLEX IN THE 8TH MILLENIUM BC. Recent excavation of a Neolithic site
in the Egyptian Sahara has produced evidence for pottery production and cattle pastoralism more
than 9,000 years ago. Evidence from this site, including a cluster of radiocarbon dates between
9800 and 9000 BP and numerous stratigraphically superimposed hearths, demonstrates long and
repeated occupation. The earliest Neolithic in this region was formerly believed to comprise only

small hunters’ camps. Evidence now suggests an early emergence of broad-based adaptive
strategies including the use of domestic stock and patterned resource exploitation, systems
previously thought to have appeared only during the Middle Neolithic 1,000 to 1,500 years later.

Central Andean culture area. This occurred during the early part of the Middle Horizon (ca.
550-700 AD). The nature of interaction between these sites is unclear, but they share a common
iconographic pantheon depicted on various media. The spatial distribution of this iconographic
repertoire is discussed. Important aspects of design structure are defined as a basis for inter-
regional comparisons. This procedure is leading to a better understanding of Huari-Tiwanaku

CULTURE: A DISPERSED HARVESTING ECONOMY. While the Late Archaic is often character-

ment pattern involving dense concentrations of populations at seasonally occupied base camps,
the Titterington Culture (2250-1900 BC) of western Illinois and Missouri has a very different
subsistence-settlement system characterized by smal! hunting and harvesting camps scattered
across the southern forested areas of the Prairie peninsula. The Titterington population is
dispersed, occurs as small groups and is highly mobile to pursue game, especially Virginia deer,
because the culture is practicing a dispersed harvesting economy, in marked contrast to other
Late Archaic cultures in the midwestern United States. (1)

EXCHANGE NETWORK IN SHELL. The presence of marine shell in many prehistoric
Southwestern sites is generally viewed as indicating an exchange system which dealt in both raw

extended along the upper and middie Santa Cruz River during the Hohokam Preclassic and early
Classic. On the basis of the test results and those from a similar study for the Gila-Salt to
Flagstaff network, it is suggested that exchange in marine shell may have operated on different
organizational levels within the Hohokam culture area. (20)

Cushman, K. (Gibbs and Hill) FLORAL REMAINS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER,
WASHINGTON COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. Botanical material that includes
seeds, fruits, wood, charcoal and pollen has been recovered from Meadowcroft Rocksheiter
(36WH297). These remains cover a ca. 16,000 year time span. All plant species identified in the
fossil record are also present in the area of the site today. The earliest plant material contains
Quercus sp., Juglans sp. and Carya sp. elements. Contrary to the assumption that proximity to
the Wisconsin glacial ice front would have produced tundra/boreal conditions near Meadowcroft,
the botanical information argues for a mixed conifer/hardwood vegetation at the site throughout
its period of human occupation. Comments on plant food resources available for human use at
and near the site are also discussed as are the corn and cucurbit domesticates from Stratum IV
that currently are the oldest known in the Upper Ohio Valley. (45)

Dickens, Roy S., Jr. (Georgia State) INFRAPATTERNS AND THE FORMATION OF THE URBAN
ARCHAEOLOGICAL RECORD. Material patterns and the cultural processes that contribute to
their formation are of current interest in historical archaeology. In urban sites, cultural formation
processes are characterized by secondary deposition that is localized, massive, and short-term in
nature. These processes often result in artifact assemblages that reflect seasonal and activity-
specific behavior. Such infrapatterns must be recognized and properly interpreted if more general
patterns of ethnicity, socioeconomic level and status are to be accurately reconstructed. Further-

. more, techniques developed for recognizing infrapatterns in the urban setting will make the con-

cept more useful in nonurban situations, where historical documentation may be less complete.

sidering their preservation for immediate or future study, analysis or display. However there are
techniques of handling artifacts that ensure their long-term survival in time- and cost-efficient

for a similar transformation in the ways archaeologists perceive their data and the objectives of

about assemblage characteristics. The method is a potentially useful, complementary tool to cur-
rent methods of analysis. Its value lies in the tighter definition of assemblage characteristics mak-
ing determinations of site types and activities clearer. (56)
Emerson, Thomas E. and George R. Milner (IIinois) COMMUNITY ORGANIZATION AND SETTLE-
MENT PATTERNS OF PERIPHERAL MISSISSIPPIAN SITES IN THE AMERICAN BOTTOM. Recent
excavations in the American Bottom have revealed large numbers of Mississippian structures
and features from “fourth-line" communities. It is now possible to recognize functionally distinct
units such as farmsteads, communal structures, and mortuary/charnal houses within these com-
munities. It is contended that such units are part of dispersed villages which represent the basic
level of Mississippian social/political/religious integration. The integration of such villages at both
the local and regional level is discussed and in addition the influence of local physiography on the
settlement pattern is examined. (11)
Epstein, Stephen M. (Pennsylvania) THE INCA COPPER SMELTING INDUSTRY AT CERRO DE
LOS CEMENTERIOS, PERU. The site of Cerro de los Cementerios lies on Peru's North Coast,
within sight of the modern agricultural cooperative of Batangrande, which has been the focus of
Princeton University’s Batan Grande-La Leche Archaeological Project since 1978. Two seasons
of survey and excavation at the Cerro have revealed an Inca copper smelting installation of in-
dustrial proportions. This industry can be characterized as 4 “prill extraction” technology, involv-
ing the grinding of slag on stone batanes to recover small droplets of smelted metal suspended in
the slag matrix, Although the smelting furnaces used are small, they occur on the site in great
numbers, with a considerable combined production potential. (27)
Ericson, Jonathon E. (Harvard) CORRELATION BETWEEN EMPIRICAL AND EXPERIMENTALLY-
DERIVED HYDRATION RATES. Generally, source-specific empirical hydration rates are deter-
mined by linear or nonlinear regression of hydration measurements and associated radiocarbon
dates. Obsidian can also be hydrated under controlled hydrothermal conditions in the laboratory.
This technique is quite straightforward. We can greatly advance obsidian hydration dating if we
know the degree of correlation between empirical and laboratory hydration rates. The results of
seven years of research on this problem are presented. (24)
Evans, Susan T. (Catholic) PROCESSUAL CHANGE IN POLITICAL STRUCTURE IN THE BASIN OF
MEXICO, LATE HORIZON. This paper presents an analytical model of processual change in the
structure of the political hierarchy of the Basin of Mexico in the Late Horizon (AD 1350-1520). In
general, the political events of this period show a trend toward the centralization of power within
a mechanically integrated system of segmental city-state units which was expanding in size and
complexity. The histories of particular political groups provide the empirical basis for a set of
ideal structures which are then interpreted using Flannery's systemic framework of cultural
evolution. Emphasis is on the changing role of the Mexica in the general hierarchy of political
control in the Basin. (42)
Falconer, Steven E. (Arizona) CERAMIC DEGENERATION AND SOCIOECONOMIC INFERENCE
IN SOUTHWESTERN ASIA. Archaeologists attempting to understand social changes in
prehistoric southwestern Asia have given special attention to studies of pottery, due to its
relative abundance and its potential to indicate temporal and geographical variability. Unfor-
tunately, interpretations of changing ceramic assemblages usually have failed to consider the
socioeconomic factors which may also be responsible for ceramic variation. This has been true
most notably when trends of change are judged to be “degenerative.” A study of ceramic change
through the Ubaid period (ca. 5300-3600 BC) of Mesopotamia illustrates how “degeneration” can
be correlated with the development of complex societies in the region. (38)
Farnsworth, Kenneth B. (Center for American Archeology) HABITATION SITE EVIDENCE FOR
WOODLAND PERIOD REGIONAL SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE LOWER ILLINOIS VALLEY
DRAINAGE. In 20 years, archaeologists working in the Lower Illinois Valley drainage have
surveyed more than 1,200 prehistoric habitation sites. A central focus of the work has been to
document regional Woodland period settlement. This paper discusses changing survey
strategies and results, and assesses the utility of extant site-reconnaissance data for reconstruc-
ting and studying changes in regional settlement patterns between 800 BC and AD 1100. Finally,
a project involving excavations at six Middle Woodland sites will be discussed, evaluating the ex-

subsistence/extractive activities on the part of Illinois Valley Middle Woodland groups. (1)
Farrand, William R. (Michigan) ROCKSHELTER AND CAVE ENVIRONMENTS. Although typical
cave dwellings represent only a limited part of the spectrum of prehistoric habitations, these
specialized niches nevertheless furnish abundant details on human paleoecology. Rapid
sedimentation and protection from subsequent erosion and weathering combine to preserve a
more detailed record than is common in open-air sites. Difficulties in interpretation stem from the
mixed and immature nature of the sediments, requiring multiple analytical techniques. Dif-
ferences in geomorphic setting, bedrock type and general climatic regime complicate com-
parisons of cave sequences from one area to another. In spite of abundant activity, no organized
theory yet exists to standardize interpretations. (50)
Farris, Glenn J. (Calif. Dept. Parks and Recreation) KEEPING HISTORY HONEST: HISTORICAL
ARCHAEOLOGY AT FORT ROSS. Historical archaeologists rely heavily on the written record.
However, archaeologists, in emphasizing the material aspects of history, have different needs
than most historians. Evidence derived from excavation projects is sometimes at variance with
“history.” In the Fort Ross case, valuable inventory documents were found to have been
mistransiated, An hypothesis was developed as to the correct translation and archaeological
findings have substantiated this hypothesis. The historical archaeologist is wise to review the
original accounts rather than to rely on the historian’s appraisal. (7)
Feder, Kenneth L. (Central Connecticut State) WHOOPS! THE USE OF MISTAKES IN LITHIC
ANALYSIS. Broken or incomplete tools, often ignored in archaeological analysis, are extremely
valuable in providing information on the stone tool manufacturing process and phase-use
histories of individual tools. Due to raw material intractability, the lithic assemblage of the Alsop
Meadow Site in Avon, Connecticut, provides us with an opportunity to examine tools broken or
abandoned in every step of the manufacturing process. This paper will present preliminary
results of the analysis of the Alsop assemblage. Steps in the tool manufacturing process as infer-
red from the cross section of broken tools recovered will be suggested. The importance of such
broken members of tool assemblages will be expanded upon. (49)
Fish, Suzanne (Arizona State Museum) PALYNOLOGICAL IDENTIFICATION OF PREHISTORIC
FIELDS. Hohokam sites of the Salt-Gila area existed within a culturally modified environment. Ir-
rigation not only allowed the survival of cultigens, but supported communities of specialized
natural taxa which can be thought of as an additional resource zone. Pollen samples from
agricultural proveniences provide a localized record of cultivation practices and an opportunity
for comparison with habitation samples. Modern analog studies have added a further dimension
to interpretation of these samples. (5)
Fitting, James E. (Professional Services Industries) INDUSTRY AND ARCHAEOLOGY. During the
past decade archaeological investigations have become an integral part of many industrial ac-
tivities. Many archaeologists have worked for industries, often with little realization of the needs
‘ and goals of these industries. This has resulted in poor communication as archaeologists make
recommendations that are not compatible with the needs and goals of industry. The purpose of
this symposium is to allow representatives of the oil and gas, coal, utility and highway construc-
tion industry to present their needs and goals, relate some experiences with archaeologists, and
to suggest to archaeologists how they might better work together. (41)
Fitzgibbons, P. T. (Pittsburgh) LITHIC ARTIFACTS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER AND
THE CROSS CREEK DRAINAGE, WASHINGTON COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA.
Six hundred six flaked stone artifacts, ca. 6000+ pieces of lithic debitage and 26 complete and
fragmentary ground stone artifacts were excavated at Meadowcroft Rockshelter between 1973
and 1977. Approximately 600 flaked stone artifacts and 100 ground stone artifacts derive from
other archaeological sites surveyed in the Cross Creek drainage. Analysis of these lithic
materials has employed surface and edge wear examination at both low and high magnification
with the objective of developing both technomorphological and functional tool typologies. The
Stratum Ia associations of the lithics at Meadowcroft are well dated via radiocarbon, and the ar-
tifacts comprise a small but highly important assemblage. These materials are among the
earliest securely dated artifacts in the Northeast. They exhibit affinities to a number of other
assemblages both in the Cross Creek drainage and elsewhere in North America. Ultimate “af-
finities” to lithic assemblages of the middle and late Upper Paleolithic of Siberia also may be evi-
dent. The full range of analytical techniques employed in the study of the Meadowcroft/Cross
Creek lithics is discussed. (45)

sistence and materia! culture variation within a discrete physiographic locale involving a
prehistoric continuum extending from the Late Archaic (2100 BC) to Early Mississippian (AD 1000)

EROM THE SURFACE SHORELINE OF TULARE LAKE, CALIFORNIA. A controlled surface collec-
tion from an ancient shoreline of Tulare Lake has been conducted. The large lithic collection in-
cludes Clovis-like and smaller fluted points, atlat! spurs, blades, crescents and assorted knives,
drilis and scraping and chopping tools. The faunal assemblage includes mammoth, horse, camel,
bison and ground sloth. A total of 16 human skull and jong bone fragments have also been
recovered, One dated specimen (12,234 + 71 BP by Uranium-Thorium) suggests contemporaneity
with Pleistocene fauna and strongly implies that the physical remains of Clovis-age people are
now known from California. (53)

UTILIZED GLASS ASSEMBLAGE. What is presumed to be an assemblage of utilized glass
fragments from the western foothills of the Sacramento Mountains in southeastern New Mexico
is being subjected to a functional analysis. It is believed that the site may represent a Mescalero
Apache camp or hunting station. None of the fragments has been retouched into formal tools. The
damage on the fragments is quite variable and as a result functional interpretations are difficult. In
an effort to understand this variability a series of experiments has been undertaken in an effort to
determine the origin of the damage, whether it is fortuitous or the result of use. These experiments
include analysis of damage resulting from breakage and use. (49)

Excavations in 1978-1979 on the Southeast Patio group of the West Ceremonial Center of
Cihuatan led to a substantia! increase in knowledge of elite residential architecture at that impor-
tant central Salvadoran Postclassic center. Three phases of construction, two of which were part-

Freidel, David A. (SMU) CERROS: PLANS, PLANTS AND POLITICS AT A LATE PRECLASSIC LOW-
LAND MAYA CENTER. Investigation of the settlement zone at Cerros had demonstrated the
presence of a complex system of canals, ditches and fields surrounding the center. Radiocarbon
dates and jn situ whole vessels document this as the earliest known extant complete hydraulic
system in the Lowlands. The system is thoroughly integrated into the intra-site plan of public
buildings at the site. It is suggested that, like the buildings, the system was a public works pro-
gram. If this is true, then the upgrading of agriculture may have “trapped” mobile swiddenists in-
to the orbit of Cerros, (3)

Fryman, R. (Pittsburgh) PREHISTORIC SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE CROSS CREEK
DRAINAGE, WASHINGTON COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. From 1974 to 1977,
the Meadowcroft/Cross Creek Archaeological Project conducted an intensive survey of the entire
Cross Creek drainage in Washington County, southwestern Pennsylvania. During that recon-
naissance, a total of 231 sites was recorded within the Cross Creek watershed. No random or
stratified sampling procedure was employed; rather, all areas not disturbed by strip mining ac-
tivities were examined on foot. Each site was coded for computer analysis utilizing a modified
range of geological, topographic, hydrological, pedological, floral, faunal and cultural variables
, 48 Fryman, R.
following Adovasio et al. (1975). After a series of computerized analyses, the resultant data were
scrutinized for any patterns which may have been operant over the 16,000-19,000 year span of
human occupation. Despite the fact that a relatively large percentage of the 231 sites produced
no chronological diagnostics, it was possible to delineate changing patterns of drainage utiliza-
tion over the entire occupational sequence. Moreover, the environmental and cultural parameters
of the various sequent Cross Creek settlement systems can be elucidated in some detail. (45)
Garber, Emily H. (New Mexico) FUTURALISTS AND PASTORALISTS: PLANNED MOBILITY AND
STORAGE STRATEGIES AMONG HERDING PEOPLES. While some researchers are asking in-
teresting questions regarding pastoral adaptations and their identification within the archaeo-
logical record, many archaeologists, despite much evidence to the contrary, continue to see
“pastoral nomadism” as a unidimensional type. If we are to see” pastoralism in the archaeo-
logical record we must know what to look for. The ethnographic literature is helpful in tins regard.
The conditions under which specific pastoral strategies will be selected are best understood
through analyses of various mobility and storage options both within and between groups. Intra-
and inter-group variability is not based upon “cultural whim” nor is it unpredictable. (12)

munity shifts from a political, religious, economic center during the Late Preclassic, to domestic

of Early Formative through Late Classic periods. The ceramic sequence matches those from
other sites as far back as the Middle Formative, and the underlying Early Formative Swasey
Phase is anchored by a number of radiocarbon dates in the millennium 2000-1000 BC. Excava-
tions in 1978-80 amplified the results of previous work and demonstrated that a formal public
~~ precinct developed by the mid-second millennium BC, with further elaboration occurring in the
Late Formative around 400 BC. The presence of jade and obsidian from the late second millen-
‘ nium indicate distant resource procurement, while plentiful carbonized plant remains document
the diet. (3)

TUKUTO LAKE, NORTHERN ALASKA: THE CROXTON CARIBOU KILL. This study analyzes the
faunal remains from the Croxton site, an important prehistoric locality situated on the shore ot
Tukuto Lake in the National Petroleum Reserve—Alaska. Radiocarbon determinations bracket
the primary occupation at Croxton between AD 900-1200, a period for which there are no other
known cultural expressions in the Arctic Foothills. Faunal remains are analyzed in terms of cer-
tain recently generated hypotheses about the nature of high-latitude economic systems in
general, and the human behavioral correlates of patterning as expressed at special purpose
localities in particular. Using reconstructed caribou population data from previously excavated
late prehistoric/historic sites at Tukuto as a basis for comparison. an effort is made to model the
relationship between herd dynamics and Stability and change in human exploitative practices.

Sexual divisions of labor in North American archaeological research have recently been
documented. This paper offers a broader perspective on male and female roles in archaeology,
demonstrating that in other societies, sex biases and sexual dichotomies of research roles are
less evident. The possibility that other types of biases such as rigid class determinations may
sometimes supercede gender bias is considered, and implications for interpreting North Ameri-
can sex role definitions are examined in this light. (31)

investigated by integrating field methods with the data storage and manipulation capabilities of
an Apple I! 48K microcomputer. Sites were photomapped, and handwritten record sheets were
also kept so that individual artifacts could be recognized from photographs. Microcomputer soft-
ware was developed to accept data derived from photographs and recording forms. in addition,
artifact location was plotted using a graphics tablet integrated with the software. Over 18,000
desoribed specimens have been mapped from one site. Preliminary analysis indicates that many
kinds of questions regarding human activity can be addressed using this system. (8)

Gilman, Patricia A. (New Mexico) DETERMINING ROOM AND FEATURE FUNCTION. Determining
room and feature function is a key aspect in ascertaining the meaning of architectural change.
However, most studies of room and feature function have selected attributes which only deter-
mine function in some, but not all, cases. This study focuses on the architectural correlates of
food storage, particularly grains and legumes. Data from ethnographic surveys and agronomic
fiterature are used to set up a series of criteria which are useful for determining patterns of
storage in the archaeological record. Architectural material from the Black Mesa Archaeological
Project, northeastern Arizona, and from the Mimbres River Valley, southwestern New Mexico, are
considered in light of these cross-cultural criteria in order to ascertain how storage facilities
changed through time in the prehistoric Southwest. (4)

Gladfelter, Bruce G. {Illinois-Chicago Circle) ALLUVIAL CONTEXTS OF ARCHAEOLOGY; WHAT
DOES IT ALL MEAN? Reconstruction of the alluvial setting of an archaeological occupation
relies heavily upon interpretations of the sediments, the paleogeomorphic setting of their site-
specific and local depositional environments, and the distribution and condition of the recovered

. artifacts. Investigations of surface landforms and subsurface alluvial units document the
sedimentological contexts, interpretations of which are based on contemporary models of
depositional facies. An understanding of fluvial processes and related forms is an essential
prerequisite for reconstructing the landform situation of a site, assessing the completeness of
the recovered archaeology, establishing correlations and chronologies, interpreting hydrologic
conditions and predicting the whereabouts of undiscovered archaeological sites. (50)

variables. If the link between observed patterns and controlling variables js strongly supported, an argu-
ment can be made that similar patterns recovered archaeologically resulted from similar conditions. This
study examines patterns ol spatial organization observed in Nunamiut Eskimo cold weather occupations
and also examines two potential controtiing variables for the observed patterns. The applicability of the
patterns is then studied in terms of archaeological case examples. (4)

Graham, Russell W. (lilinois State Museum) EVOLUTION OF LATE QUATERNARY BIOTIC COM-
MUNITIES: HUMAN RESPONSE. The late Glacial biota of North America has no modern analog
and in fact the biomes that are evident today probably evolved less than 8,000 years ago. Evolu-
tion of these modern biomes progressed as individual species responded to late Glacial climatic
changes in accordance with their own tolerance limits. Therefore, human adaptive strategies did
not merely “track"’ discrete and immutable biotic zones that were displaced spatially and tem-
porally. Instead, adaptive strategies had to be sensitive to subtle changes in species composition
of communities. Therefore, the accuracy of the direct application of the Ecosystem Similarity
Concept in modeling human adaptive strategies to late Quaternary environments is time-
dependent and it may not even be relevant to late Glacial environments and cultures. (19)

developed. This model is based upon a simple continuity principle: the rate at which an object ac-
cumulates within a region is equal to the rate at which the object is manufactured within the
region plus the rate at which it enters the region minus the rate at which it leaves. In order to solve
the resulting set of differential equations assumptions must be made concerning interactions
among regions and/or objects. Parameters used in this study include rate of manufacture and
population size. Calculations are presented which use known archaeological data sets as jI-
lustrations of the model. (37)
Green, Stanton W. and Marek Zvelebil (South Carolina) BRIDGING THE ATLANTIC: A CRITICAL
OVERVIEW OF AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN ARCHAEOLOGY. This paper provides a critical
\discussion of American and European approaches to the study of culture change. Despite some
clear historical differences in scientific approach there is no simple descriptive American/Euro-
pean dichotomy in archaeology. American research has relied heavily on anthropological con-
cepts and ethnographic models; while European archaeologists have emphasized archaeological
cultures. Both schools have utilized economic models, though Americans have emphasized
ecosystemic models, while Europeans have utilized paleoeconomic and marxist models. Both
sides have recently undertaken attempts to involve social variables in their interpretive efforts.
This paper will critically discuss these approaches from a general and historical point of view, as
well as through a preview of the papers in the symposium. (2)

Grimes, John R. (Peabody Museum of Salem) HAFTED MICROJOOLS FROM THE BULL BROOK
PALEOINDIAN SITE. Among the ca. 9,000 stone tools recovered from the Bull Brook site in
Massachusetts are several lesser known minority types which occur in sufficient numbers to
allow detailed technological analysis. Among these are drills with unidirectional bits and whit-
| tling tools, both used in a haft, indicative of a well developed bone and/or wood working industry.
Their sophistication has negative ramifications for the traditional image of a paleoindian lithic
technology strictly adapted to procurement and processing of big game. It is suggested that
study of such minority forms is fundamental not only to an understanding of paleoindian
litestyles, but also to demonstrating relationships between paleoindian assemblages and their

possible continuity with Old World technologies. (35)

mains (i.e., retouched stone tools and debitage) from the Beauronnian, or |Vb level, at the open-
air site of Solvieux, Dordogne, France. In the present analysis, this technique is one of several
distinct approaches being used to isolate functionally significant patterning in the horizontal

vigorous raptor (primarily owl) roost and a continuing but intermittent Indian occupation through-
out the faunal sequence. Ecological analysis by stratum suggests that the major features of the
temperate biota, and by inference the vertebrate resources of the human inhabitants of the
rockshelter, remained unaffected by minor climatic adjustments from ca. 9000 BC (11 000 BP) un-
ti) the Historic Period. The Meadowcroft faunal assemblage includes both specimens deposited
by raptorial roosting birds and by human occupants of the rockshelter. White-tailed deer
(Odocoileus virginianus) dominates the Indian refuse component. Paleoclimatic and biogeographic
implications of the Meadowcroft archaeofauna are discussed in the light of other mid-

40 the continuing destruction of the nation's irreplacable resources. Ecological, scenic, architec-
tural and archaeological resources frequently occur together. They need to be perceived and
preserved as a whole. This is possible if existing laws, programs and conservation and preserva-

districts and landmark ordinances can and should be used to protect archaeological resources
as well as historic buildings. The need to preserve more archaeological sites exists and should be
used more frequently than data recovery. (14)

Hajic, Edwin R. and Thomas R. Styles (Center for American Archeology) DYNAMIC SURFICIAL
GEOLOGY OF THE LOWER ILLINOIS VALLEY REGION AND THE IMPACT ON THE AR-
CHAEOLOGICAL RECORD. It is critical that researchers in the region respect the fact that the ar-
chaeological record was fundamentally shaped by coevolving surficial geologic systems. The
magnitude of landscape change was large enough to strongly modify the distribution of basic
resources and thus the spatial patterning of prehistoric human activities. Preservation of the
record of these activities was profoundly influenced, and often distorted, by erosion or burial of
ierge areas of former land surfaces. While the general pattern through most of Holocene time is

Hale-Pierce, Carolyn A. (SUNY-Buffalo) WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? THE SMALL-SCALE
SURVEY REVISITED. This paper introduces the problems relevant to smail-scale archaeological
surveys, which comprise the bulk of archaeological investigation being conducted in the United
States today. These problems include the utility of small-scale surveys In research, the viability
of eliminating certain small-scale surveys altogether, methodological considerations and the
roles of contractors, institutions, archaeologists and agencies. A symposium held in 1978 ex-

amined similar problems. The panel today reexamines that symposium and offers new solutions
to extant problems as well as to those which have arisen in the past four years. (40)
Hall, Edwin S. (U.S. Geological Survey, SUNY-Brockport) ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN
NORTHERN ALASKA: AN OVERVIEW, Investigations of the archaeological resources in northern
Alaska began in the late 1800s and progressed through four distinct periods Characterized by
geographic focus and specific research concerns: the Coastal Pioneer period (1881-1946), the in-
terior Pioneer period (1947-1969), the Alyeska Pipeline Period (1970-1975) and the Cultural
Resource Management period (1976-present). Consideration of the data recovered during 100
years of archaeological investigation permits formulation of a tentative culture historical frame-
work and suggests some directions for future fieldwork. (28)
Hall, Robert L. (Illinois-Chicago Circle) WATER-WATER EVERYWHERE: ATL-ATL FINGERHOLES
AS EYE METAPHORS IN MESOAMERICA AND NORTH AMERICA. Spearthrower tingerholes were
figurative eyes and as such carried some of the symbolic load of eyes as they were seen to relate
to springs, waterholes, cenotes and underworld entrances. The structural equivalency of much
hitherto unrelated Mesoamerican and North American symbolism is demonstrated. Specifically
mentioned are the three-striped eye of Xipe, the goggle eye of Tlaloc, the turquoise glyph and kan
cross, the mirror on the foot of Tezcatlipoca, the relationship of the atlati to fertility, the
etymology of atiatl, nonagricultural associations of Xipe, the roseate spoonbill as a trans-
formation of Xipe and as a Hopewellian motif and North American/Mesoamerican interaction. (42)
Hally, David J. (Georgia) THE VESSEL ASSEMBLAGE IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. The
vessel assemblage is defined as the array of morphologically and functionally differentiated pot-
tery vessels that exist to meet the needs of a particular society, community or household.
General features of vessel assemblages in noncomplex societies, suggested by ethnographic
Studies of contemporary pottery-using communities, are discussed. Analysis of pottery collec-
tions derived from two 16th century aboriginal sites in northwestern Georgia demonstrates that
vessel assemblages can be reconstructed from archaeological collections. Similarities between
the ethnographically and archaeologically documented vessel assemblages are discussed, The
research potential of vessel assemblage analysis is discussed. (55)
Halstead, Paul (Cambridge) RECENT APPLICATIONS OF ADAPTIVE/ECOLOGICAL MODELS: A
VIEW FROM THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC. This paper argues that adaptation to short-
term (inter-annual) environmental variability is of particular importance for an understanding of
culture change, and that small-scale (local) environmental variability plays a major role in such
adaptation. Within this framework arguments about optimizing versus Satisficing strategies in
human adaptations are seen as a theoretical “red herring”. Human ecology subsumes human
Social behviour, as a consequence of which ecological models of culture change should not be
seen as narrowly exclusive of, or in opposition to, social models. (2)

PERISHABLE INDUSTRIES OF THE JUNTUNEN SITE, UPPER GREAT LAKES. Perishabie fiber in-
dustries, including cordage, fabrics and basketry, were utilized to decorate Late Woodland
: ceramics in the Upper Great Lakes. This research has examined ca. 350 ceramic vessels im-
pressed with perishable materials from the Juntunen site (at the Straits of Mackinac located be-
tween Lake Michigan and Lake Huron). Detailed attribute analysis of the diverse perishables has
been undertaken on the level of “vessel lots,” enabling correlation of both perishable and
ceramic attributes. Analysis and interpretation has focused on the structural types of perishables
in both temporal and spatial frameworks of Upper Great Lakes prehistory, (39)
Hammond, Norman (Rutgers) SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN NORTHERN BELIZE. Intensive Survey
by a number of projects over the Past decade has resulted in the ancient Maya settlement pattern
of northern Belize being among the best documented in the Maya lowlands. The geomorpho-
logical and pedological structure of the region is well understood, consisting of folded limestone
ridges with overlying Miocene sands in places, and a vegetation pattern of rain forest with areas
of pine.savanna is general, though now relict in only a few places. Ancient settlement is mainly
on the ridges, especially in the western portion of the area, and includes sites of major
ceremonial center status as well as small loci. The paper describes this pattern and relates it to
topography and communications. (3)

discipline. Some views portray science as being entirely shaped by sociological factors rather
than by considerations of truth and justification. More generally, recent history and philosophy of

Hannus, L. Adrien (South Dakota State) EVIDENCE OF MAMMOTH BUTCHERING AT THE
LANGE/FERGUSON (39SH33) CLOVIS KILL SITE. The site represents the first substantiated
evidence of Clovis hunters in direct association with butchered bones of mammoth and other
megafauna in the Dakotas. Several lines of evidence, both taphonomic and artifactual, exist to
corroborate the incidence of killing and butchering activity at the Lange/Ferguson (39SH33) Site.

| A |arge number of flake blades produced on heavy mammoth bone have been recovered including
several which were tightly wedged into thoracic vertebrae. Additionally, several segments of
mammoth bone representing prepared cores, and exhibiting the removal of long channel flakes
were recovered. A minimal C-14 determination of 10,670 + 7,300 BP has been reported. (34)

. Hansen, Eric (SUNY-Buffalo) SMALL-SCALE SURVEYS AND REGIONAL-LEVEL RESEARCH. In
this paper a strategy for utilizing aggregated data from small-scale surveys in addressing
regional-level research questions is outlined. Each survey is treated as an independent sample of
the research universe (western New York) and information on site locations, size, chronology,
topography and climate are coded for computer manipulation. Distribution maps of indices con-
structed from the coded data are compared to expected distributions deduced from ecological
tneory. The research potential of this strategy is founded upon the notion that the whole is
greater than the sum of its parts; that when taken together the many small-scale surveys done

| over the past two decades provide a more than adequate sample for studying regional-level
cultural patterns. (40)

Hard, Robert J. (Ft. Bliss) TARAHUMARA ETHNOARCHAEOLOGY, The Tarahumara Indians of
Southwest Chihuahua, Mexico utilize rockshelters for winter habitation as part of a transhuma-
nant cycle. Other Tarahumaras do not practice this transhumanant cycle and only occupy a
single house throughout the year. A comparison of the organization and content of rockshelters
and houses suggests that the cycle of domestic activities that are a part of Tarahumara adapta-
tions directly condition the organization and content of residences. The implications of this
eesearch for understanding the functions of archaeological sites is examined. (4)

noth the Aurignacian and the preceding Mousterian, the Chatelperronian is best characterized as

SURVEYS: ISOLATED REPORTS OR INTEGRATED RESEARCH? This paper examines the role of
small-scale surveys in Massachusetts in fulfilling the goals of CRM. Since these surveys con-
stitute the bulk of the archaeology conducted in this and neighboring states, the ultimate value of
the CRM program hinges on the integration of small survey results into a regional research
teamework. Evaluation of survey reports from Massachusetts (1970-1979), however, indicates
that post hoc integration is difficult, if not impossible, given present problems in survey report:
wg These problems may be minimized in the future through changes in the intensity and orienta-
son of background research, and through improvements in aspects of report specificity. (40)

disposal. The study will examine material collected from a Late Archaic/Late Woodland blufftop
habitation site situated in westcentral Illinois. The analysis will be Conducted at two levels: (1)
multiple gridded surface collections within a plowed field will be examined for artifact clusters
and their association with subsurface pil features will be examined, and (2) within nonplowed por-

matrix. (1)

Hastings, Charles M. (Michigan) HIGHLAND SETTLEMENTS IN EASTERN FORESTS: LATE IN-
TERMEDIATE COLONIZATION OF THE CENTRAL PERUVIAN CEJA DE MONTANA. Andean ver-
ticality is discussed with reference to a recent archaeological survey in the provinces of Tarma
and Chanchamayo. Transition zones between sierra and Amazonia were settled by the Late In-
termediate Taruma culture at the margins of its territorial expansion. The Taruma population in
the eastern flanks of the Andes is viewed from the perspective of being a distinct subgroup,
rather than as a transhumant labor force from the Tarma highlands or a heterogeneous collection
of workers representing diverse villages or political leaders elsewhere. Settlement and sub-
sistence patterns of this subgroup are examined with supporting ethnographic data from local
traditional communities. (46)

Hathaway, J. Holly (see Eighmy, Jeffrey L.) 47)

Hayden, Brian (Simon Fraser) FROM CHOPPER TO CELT: THE EVOLUTION OF RESHARPENING
TECHNIQUES. Different techniques which are used for resharpening stone tools are viewed as
being responses to three major variables: (1) cutting requirements, (2) the frequency with which
lithic tools must be replaced and (3) the availability of lithic raw materials. Largely because cut-
ting requirements increased over time together with advances in wood technology, the resharpen-
ing mode changed from hard-hammer percussion, to soft-hammer percussion, to the secondary
resharpening of flakes, to pressure resharpening and finally to edge grinding. (13)

Haynes, C. Vance (Arizona) THE STRATIGRAPHIC EVIDENCE OF PLEISTOCENE EXTINCTION IN
THE UNITED STATES. The stratigraphic abruptness of the end of the Rancholabrean megafauna
is the most impressive aspect of Pleistocene extinction. At many sites across the United States it
occurs at a marked stratigraphic break representing an erosional hiatus between 12,500 and
11,500 BP. During this time, coeval with the final stage of deglaciation, streams underwent net
degradation, water tables declined, major vegetation changes occurred, and Clovis hunters ap-
peared, All of these factors are probably significant to the cause of extinction, but the reduction
of traditional watering places at the time when human predators were added (to the scene may
have been the main factors in extinction occurring when it did. (19)

Haynes, Gary (Smithsonian) ON WATERING HOLES, MINERAL LICKS, DEATH AND PREDATION.

“Some Pleistocene bone collections from North America are examined using new taphonomic
perspectives, including Paleoindian and pre-Liano site materials. Important variables in the

x dynamics of past ecosystems are reflected in natural modifications to bones and assemblages,
some of which have been mistaken for the effects of human behavior. These modifications can be
deciphered to distinguish true kills from scavenges, to indicate local prey vulnerability towards
predation, to identify genera or families of carnivores and scavengers without the necessity of
finding bones of these animals themselves and to clarify local conditions of bone accumulation
in the past. (19)

Hays, T. R. (North Texas State) CURRENT RESEARCH ON THE NEOLITHIC OF THE CENTRAL
SUDAN. This paper reports the preliminary results of recent field work undertaken in the Republic
of Sudan. The research was focused on the late prehistoric cultural development east of the Nile
River Valley in Central Sudan. Specifically, the project considered: (1) the degree to which
Neolithic traits (pottery, domesticated foods) spread eastward from the Nile or westward to the
Nile, (2) the past grasslands of Central Butana played as a barrier or interaction zone and (3) the
complex cultural development near the Atbara River at the end of the Neolithic period. Tentative
conclusions regarding the evolution of the Neolithic economy in a marginal environment are pre-
sented. (18)

Hayward, Michele H. (Pennsylvania State) IMPROVED METHOD OF RECORD LINKAGE USING
COLONIAL MEXICAN PARISH RECORDS. Studies that have presented an outline of the growth
and decline of the colonial Mexican Indian population have been criticized for (1) too much
generality and (2) insufficient attention to inaccuracies in the data. To obtain a more specific and
accurate understanding of population changes, parish records have also been used. A principal
problem with these records is that individuals do not possess surnames. Here, a method is
presented whereby records may be linked without the use of surnames. Methodological problems

Healy Paul F. (Trent) AN ANCIENT MAYA DAM IN THE CAYO DISTRICT, BELIZE. In recent years
*here has been a growing awareness of the advanced hydraulic engineering skills of the ancient
sowland Maya. A significant amount of research has focused upon their sophisticated abilities to
ese and control water for cultivation, trade, transport, defense and rituals. Although water control
techniques such as canals, wells and reservoirs are known from a multitude of Maya sites, there
has been little discussion of ancient Maya dams. This paper suggests that Maya dam building
may have been more widespread than previously estimated, and one such feature, discovered in
7880, is examined in detail. A description of the construction, its size, age and probable function
ts included along with a comparison to other, similar hydraulic features in the Maya subarea and

trom the Formative through the Postclassic are employed in the reconstruction of diachronic pat-
terns of resource use, with a focus on those resources relating directly to subsistence activities.
Most models of resource utilization and the development of civilizations in the central Mexican
srea have centered solely on the Basin of Mexico. This material from the adjacent region of west-
een Morelos gives some perspective to the Basin of Mexico data and contributes to an overall
uederstanding of cultural evolution in central Mexico. (42)

southern Jordan resulted in the discovery of 81 sites with occupations which spanned most of
the Late Pleistocene and Holocene. A comparison of the cultural and environmental successions
of the region with parallel sequences in the Levant reveals that the prehistoric inhabitants of
=suthern Jordan interacted more strongly with populations of the northern Levant than with near-
by southern Levantine groups. Only during markedly arid episodes were strong relations estab-
“shod with southern Levantine populations. Prehistoric interaction spheres within the region ap-
peer to have been influenced more by environmental setting than geographic proximity. (1B)

Hoag, Paul W. (North Dakota) ARCHAEOLOGICAL PHOTOGRAPHY: THE STATE OF THE ART.

The state of the art of archaeological photography is reviewed with special attention to satellite

sensing, vertical aerial photography, oblique aerial photography and close-range terrestrial
stereophotogrammetry. The place of photographic techniques within information gathering
strategies is the focus. Practical considerations as well as links to more generalized archaeolog-

ical methodology are discussed. A typology of archaeological problems amenable to photo-

graphic techniques is developed; metric as well as nonmetric applications are considered. The

need for innovations in this archaeological subspecialty is detailed and directions for new

research explored. An extensive, annotated bibliography is provided. (52)

Hodges, Richard (Sheffield) PEER POLITY INTERACTION AND THE POLITICAL EVOLUTION OF
MEDIEVAL ITALY. In this paper the evolution of the 12th century city communes of North Italy

will be considered. The existence of three political stages—steps towards the formation of the
communes—will be proposed. Stage 1 describes the civic modules of the Migration Period

(6th-8th centuries); stage 2 is concerned with the competing core areas within the Carolingian

Empire (c. 750-c, 850), and stage 3 is concerned with the communes of the 10th century and later.

The inter- and intra-policy interactions will be discussed in terms of ceramic, ecclesiastical and
numismatic evidence for each stage to illustrate the importance of resource control. Finally,

some comparison will be made between the modular evolution of the core area of medieval

Europe and the very different political formations in the peripheral, secondary states of Europe at

this time. (36)

Hoffman, Charles M. (Arkansas) PROJECTILE POINT MORPHOLOGY: INFLUENCES OF
MEASUREMENT TECHNIQUES ON DATA STRUCTURE. Potentials for measurement error and
ambiguity make objective estimates of projectile point morphology difficult to achieve. A concise

but representative measure of point morphology can be obtained using polar coordinate
measurements and principal components analysis. By precisely locating measurements and

allowing multiple measures of complex forms, morphological variation and asymmetry can be
represented accurately. Nevertheless, precautions should be taken to avoid generating artificial ‘
asymmetry and poorly defined or spurious factors. Using polar coordinate measurement with

principal components analysis balances efficiency and directness of measurement technique
with accuracy in portraying point morphology while reducing ambiguity and error in analysis. (37)
Hohmann, John W. (Arizona State) SINAGUA MORTUARY RITUAL: INFERENCES IN
PREHISTORIC SOCIAL COMPLEXITY. Three hundred eighty-two burials and associated offerings

are analyzed for evidence of social differentiation in northern Sinagua society. It is hypothesized

that a change in Sinagua social organization and differentiation occurs between the Angell- ;
Winona (AD 1066-AD 1100) and Elden (AD 1130-AD 1250) phases. It is demonstrated that during

the Angell-Winona phase the society had limited stratification with high status predominantly

held by adult males. By contrast, during the Elden phase the society was a complex stratified
community in which members of selected families were given high status burials. Such change

may be related to the growth and development of trade networks and the emergence of a mer-

chant class. (25)
Holley, George R. (Southern Illinois) ELABORATION AND CERAMIC CHANGE: A MORPHO-
METRIC PERSPECTIVE. The metric reduction of ceramic vessel form permits researchers to
recognize and interpret subtle, elaborative changes. This study argues that a morphometric
perspective, borrowed from physical anthropology, is a necessary compliment in the analysis of

form change. Definitions of elaboration, its measurement and statistical manipulation are dis-

cussed. The Classic Maya ceramic remains from Piedras Negras, Guatemala are used to il-

lustrate the potential for this approach. (38)

patterns of community organization. This approach first identifies bounded units of functionally

specific land use. Next, community structure is addressed on three levels: (1) the identification of

primary functional subsets within bounded units, (2) an analysis of relationships between bound-
ed units which form interactive “facility groups” and (3) the organization of all facility groups at
the community level. Implications for changing sociopolitical organization are then examined.

survey was Carried out in 1981 in advance of the proposed construction of |-195, 1-295, NJ 29 and
NJ 129 in Trenton, NJ. The major emphasis of the survey was the Abbott Farm National Land-
mark, but this paper deals with an adjacent industrial district close to the falis of the Delaware
River. The industrial district, which includes an early Cooper-Hewitt ironworks, a number of 19th
century mill sites and a complex water power system, is located in an area of intensive early
historic and prehistoric activity. This paper examines the problems of using gross excavation
techniques while maintaining sensitivity to fragile early historic and prehistoric remains. (7)

examines the yellow ribbon phenomenon which preceded and followed the release of the
American hostages from Iran in January, 1981. The questions here concern the suitability of the
yellow ribbon as a material referent and as an expressive symbol. The yellow ribbon, made
famous by the Orlando song, is identified as an analogue for the wedding ring, a symbol of lasting
union. Evidence from myth, text and social science serve to Illustrate the link by analogy and to
define the source of symbolic power. Dual oppositions and ritual transformations in color and ob-
ject symbolism are discussed. (26)

Irwin-Williams, Cynthia (E. New Mexico) ARCHAEOLOGICAL VISIBILITY AND THE RECOGNI-
TION OF PATTERNED BEHAVIOR FOR DESERT HUNTERS AND GATHERERS. The problem of
the variable archaeological visibility of desert hunters/gatherers has long been recognized as a
critical one in the recognition and explanation of prehistoric behavior. The record of the desert
foragers of the southwestern U.S. provides an excellent example of the problem. At the heart of
the dilemma is the concept of the archaeological site" as it is currently employed. A new con-
ceptual framework for dealing with desert hunter-gatherers is proposed, and the derivative
methodology and initial field experiments are outlined. Implications of the approach for under-
standing both contemporary and ancient hunter-gatherers are explored. (53)

Isbell, William H. (Binghamton) EMERGENCE OF STATE ADMINISTRATION AT HUARI, PERU.
Huari became the capital of an expansionist state shortly after AD 500. Archaeological research
indicates that its first steps toward centralized, hierarchical administration were preceded by a
Strategy of colonization in ecologically contrastive regions. The transformation to centalized,
secular bureaucracy was stimulated by religious beliefs developed at Tiwanaku, Bolivia.
However, Tiwanaku religion was not adopted at Huari. Rather, the hierarchical and centralized
structure of Tiwanaku's religious system was combined with Huari’s traditional strategy of
economic colonization to produce a uniquely Andean form of political administration. (46)

Jermann, Jerry V. (Washington) SAMPLING AND SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION: PROBLEMS IN
REPLICATING SPATIAL PATTERN FROM SAMPLE DATA, Archaeologists almost universally
presume that sample data adequate for characterizing the contents of their research universe
also yield reliable estimates of that data’s spatial patterning, A factorial experiment is described
that examines variability in adequacy of spatial rendition attributable to the fixed effects of sam-
ple selection procedure and size. Results obtained for populations exhibiting marked differences
in spatial autocorrelation demonstrate that reliability of spatial interpolations is dependent upon
@ target population’s underlying dispersion. The significance of experimental results to ar-
chaeology’s emergent geographic paradigm is discussed, and quidelines for sample designs that
attend spatial problerns are offered. (8)

southeast Arkansas during the AD 1400-1700 period. Cemetery sites containing more than 50 in-
dividuals, often accompanied by ceramic vessels or other grave goods, were excavated by the

is in need of reevaluation. Quantification of attributes suggests that important variables used to
define traditional types do not cooccur regularly or exhibit constant rates of change. The nature
of stylistic change in the Pioneer-Colonial periods and the implications for the existing prevalent

sites situated in diverse habitats and ranging in time from about 2600 BC to 1300 AC. Current
paleoethnobotanical investigations are concerned with delineating the changing man/piant rela-

ponents are presented, focusing upon the temporal and spatial variation occurring in the pattern
of plant remains. (11)

Johnson, W. C. (Pittsburgh) CERAMICS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER, WASHINGTON
COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. The 1973-1977 excavations at Meadowcroft pro-
duced 420 ceramic sherds and spalls, All ceramics are restricted to Stratum IV and above with the
exception of a few obviously intrusive sherds in slumps along the back (north) wall of the shelter.
The four basic types of ceramic wares originally described by Mayer-Oakes (1955a) for the Upper
Ohio Valley are represented and include grit-tempered Half Moon ware, limestone-tempered Wat-
son ware, grit-tempered Mahoning ware and shell-tempered Monongahela ware. The 420 sherds
can be reduced to 44 reconstructed vessel “clusters:"’ two Half Moon, 36 Watson, three Mahoning |
and fhree Monongahela vessels. The two Half Moon vessels represent the oldest dated ceramics
in the Upper Ohio Valley and are directly associated with radiocarbon determinations of 865 + 85
BC and 870 + 75 BC. The cordage twist preference for the Watson ware is predominantly Z twist.
Thirty-six of the limestone-tempered vessel clusters, all of the shell-tempered vessels and two of

Jones, Marcia L. (Southern Methodist) THE SIGNIFICANCE OF INTRA-SITE VARIABILITY IN
TECHNOLOGICAL INDICES: A TEST CASE. An Increasing number of studies utilize technolog-
ical indices to characterize and compare lithic assemblages. These studies frequently assume no
intta-site variability in technological indices used for comparisons. Jelenik describes a trend ina
technological index for Mousterian industries from the Levant which transcends typological
variability. A sampling strategy is designed to test for spatial and temporal variability in this tech-
nological index using material from Rosh Ein Mor. The paper examines whether the variability
within any particular assemblage is sufficiently small to allow definition of such a technological
index and whether the Rosh Ein Mor material fits Jelenik's scheme. (37)

raw materials when resource supplies are constrained. As raw material becomes expensive,
strategies such as standardized artifact forms, reduction in too! size, and an extension of tool

use-life should be used by hunter-gatherers using lithic tools. The model is tested using data from
Mound City, Ohio, a Middle Woodland habitation and mortuary site. The analysis supports the

FORMATION ON OBSIDIANS AND TEKTITES. Understanding film formations on obsidians is
important since they are used for dating artifacts. Surface reactions of three obsidians and one
tektite were evaluated in three solutions: deionized water, simulated silicate ground water and a
brine solution. Solution concentrations, pH and mass loss were measured as a function of time
under controlled exposure conditions. Additionally, the surfaces of the samples were analyzed
with fourier transform infrared reflection spectography, AUGER electron spectography coupled
with Arion milling and scanning electron microscopy. Preliminary results of solution and surface
analyses suggest that film formation is more complex than can be explained with a simple hydra-
tion reaction. (24)

Kaiser, Timothy (UC-Berkeley) IMPLICATIONS OF GHANGING PATTERNS OF CERAMIC PRO-

sites in Yugoslavia and Romania are examined in terms of the ways in which labor and resources
are combined. By the late Neolithic, ceramic production was intensified, with every stage in the
production process routinely involving a wider range and greater amount of both resources and
jabor. Increased and more focused production lead to conclusions concerning the reorganization
of the social relations of production. (38)

mains involves determining the relationship between age and osteon population density. It is

From 1870 to World War ll, forty acres and a mule and shares characterize land use and economic

CLIMATE CHANGE AS A NATIONAL ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH TOPIC. We know that
climatic changes have occurred during the Holocene, but we lack detailed knowledge about their
magnitude and their effects on particular areas. We also lack information on their periodicity and
predictability. These data are crucial to modern water resource and land use planning. Archaeol-
ogy can provide valuable insights, because of the widespread nature of archaeological resources
and because they place environmental change in a human context. West coast data suggest that
the climate has shifted in a cyclic pattern since the Altithermal, and that a period of depressed
precipitation may now be beginning. Data from the northern Plains and the Southwest present a
somewhat different picture. The data are outlined and the steps needed to make archaeological
data relevant to long range weather forecasting and environmental planning are discussed. (33)

Kintigh, Keith (Arizona) MEASURING ARCHAEOLOGICAL DIVERSITY WITHOUT PAIN. A method
tor the measurement of diversity is proposed. This method relies on a model which uses an ar-

theoretical expectations for the number of different classes of items which should be found ina
collection of a given total size. Because sample size is controlled for, collections of different
sizes can be directly compared in a simple graphical display. Because of its rigor and simplicity,
this method serves to focus interpretive attention on issues of anthropological importance. .

Kisselburg, JoAnn E. (Arizona State) REEXAMINING THE VARIABILITY IN CERAMIC DESIGN.
Ceramic typology has been a useful tool in roughing out the chronology of prehistoric societies. |
As our data base increases, however, we find that typologies become less useful. Several recent- )
ly excavated Hohokam sites provide ceramic assemblages that are not easily assigned to
chronological phases in terms of the traditional typology devised by Haury. Assigning transi- |
tional status to these assemblages cannot account for all the variation. This paper suggests |
some methods of examining the dynamics of design variability to attempt to sort out which
design variations may be due to atemporal factors such as production specialization, boundary
markers and vessel use. (15)
Klein, Richard G. (Chicago) CULTURAL EVOLUTION DURING THE MIDDLE AND LATER STONE
AGE IN SOUTHERN AFRICA. Later Stone Age (LSA) Peoples, succeeding Middle Stone Age (MSA)
ones 40-30,000 BP in southern Africa, not only made very different kinds of artifacts than their
predecessors, but appear to have exploited animal resources more efficiently and intensively.
Faunal assemblages from a series of MSA and LSA sites suggest that only LSA people routinely
caught fish and fowl, that they were much better equipped to capture relatively dangerous ter-
restrial prey and that they cropped small mammals, tortoises and shellfish at a much higher rate
than their MSA predecessors. Combined artifactual and faunal data indicate that the LSA
represented a kind of quantum advance over the MSA in southern Africa. (6)

amining the history of ethnoarchaeology, it is found that prevailing concepts of culture have
strongly conditioned the way in which ethnoarchaeology has been done or discussed. It is possi-
ble to expose fallacies in the notion of analogy commonly espoused by (ethno-) archaeologists
(without relying on Gould's, Binford’s or Schiffer’s dismissals of the term), and finally to expand
and reformulate Schiffer’s contention that ethnoarchaeology, to be properly explanatory, must be
a law-seeking endeavor. (12)
Knobloch, Patricia J. (Binghamton) CERAMIC STYLE AND CHRONOLOGY AT HUARI, PERU.
Ceramics indicating occupation from AD 300 to AD 650 were collected at Huari, Peru, from
stratified refuse deposits. In the 1960s, Dorothy Menzel established a seriational chronology of
ceramic styles for this area and time. Analysis of the stratified materials supports her
chronology. In addition, other patterns of progressive stylistic change were discovered. These
patterns reveal the beginnings of stylistic innovations as well as the integration or culmination of
other attributes. As a result, the temporal changes in the ceramic styles can be defined more ex-
plicitly. These patterns of change are important for interpreting the culture history of the Huari
site and its relationship to other Middle Horizon centers. (46)

Period. Early Swasey pottery, first found at the site of Cuello, has now been found at a number of

Kraft, John C. (Delaware) MARINE ENVIRONMENTS/LITTORAL REGIONS. The dynamics of
coastal change, as related to archaeology, are highly varied and dependent upon the type of
coastal zone being studied. Cliff-type coasts are usually tectonically controlled and undergoing
retreat. This causes archaeological sites to be destroyed. In this case the most important data of
coastal reconstruction is the geological analysis of the rate of cliff erosion and the nature of the
sediment or rock undergoing erosion. On the other hand, depositional-type shorelines associated
with river floodplains, deltas or lagoon barrier beaches must be approached from a completely
different point of view. Subsurface drill-hole evidence is needed to determine the three dimen-
sional shape of the sedimentary bodies and radiocarbon dates are needed to put the shorelines
and sedimentary bodies into a time frame. (50)

The term “negative-painting,” as commonly used in the archaeological literature, denotes a wax-

many of these were available prehistorically, their use for ceramic resist decoration is not known

niques in order to determine observable differences in the finished wares, Both unfired and fired
samples of these tests are presented. (Poster Session— Thursday)

benefit—and attempts to explain the observable trend toward systemic mediocrity in terms of

laboratory conditions, hydration is controlled by the interdiffusion of hydrogen ions (from water)
with alkali ions in the glass. Also, by combining the measurement of the hydration rate (at am-

Larsen, Curtis E. (USGS) GEOARCHAEOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF LAKESHORE EN-
VIRONMENTS. Lakeshore settings were among the areas most commonly sought by prehistoric
groups. The presence of waterfowl, fish and shelifish, not to mention the freshwater resource, led
to concentrations of population in productive environments. Thus, the archaeological literature
abounds with apparent relationships between sites and “strandlines,” “raised terraces" and
“beaches.” Site stratigraphy includes “waterlain” sands covering or underlying archaeological
components. Geologically, however, the definition of lacustrine and lakeshore environments is
more complex. The use of coastal landforms and environments in the Great Lakes region is an ex-
ample to aid archaeological interpretation. Common misconceptions of the data needed to
recognize lake-related sites are discussed as are the types of data required to critically interpret

poral changes in point popularity are modeled with a variety of distributions which are then
summed to produce a population utilization curve for the Holocene. Regional trends indicate (1) a
gradual increase in utilization of the area through the Middle Archaic, (2) a slight decline in the
Late Archaic, (3) a dramatic increase during Woodland times and (4) a correspondingly large
decrease in the Late Prehistoric. Correlation with climatic episodes appears to account for some
of the observed trends. (23)

species lived on the wooded, brushy or grassy slopes surrounding the site, while the remainder
flourished in the water of a shallow lake in which the mammoth is presumed to have floundered.
The absence of branchiate gastropods points to a lake of relative youthfulness. The climate was

This is viewed with respect to the intensified exploitation of indigenous resources and the mid-
Holocene climatic optimum occurring at the time. The solution proposed recognizes the balance
, Lord, K. 65
between determinacy at a global scale and the uniqueness of geographic location and prior
historical development. The author suspects that were the barriers to the extension of the west
Asiatic mode more robust, the European Mesolithic communities would conform in later
prehistory to the pattern of (Jomon) Japan and (Woodland) North America in pursuing the
development of local resources to such a degree that sedentary ceramic-using communities
without mixed farming would have resulted. (2)
Lindauer, Owen (Arizona State) A “BEHAVIORAL” APPROACH TO ARTIFACT SCATTERS. In spite
of stimulating research on Hohokam chronology, regional interaction and general processual
issues, problems still remain in interpreting basic information sources such as artifact scatters.
Proponents of Schiffer's “behavioral” approach have defined issues relating to these problems
but have failed to operationalize them adequately. Alternative strategies are offered in studying
the relations of surface to subsurface remains at a Hohokam site. An interpretive model that uses
information on the degree of ceramic breakage and conjoinability is proposed that operational-
izes several concepts of site formation and transformation. The information potential of sherd
and lithic scatters is then discussed and the contribution their study may make is evaluated. (15)

low to support rapid population increase and the beginnings of sociocultural complexity during

tions of the marine ecosystem by periodic nifios. Increased rainfall accompanying severe nifos,
however, temporarily increases the productivity of flood plain agriculture and natural terrestrial
ecosystems, suggesting that coastal populations temporarily shifted subsistence strategies and
returned to a maritime orientation when the marine ecosystem returned to normal. (10)

Dangtalan, northern Luzon, the Philippines, were recorded and “tagged.” In 1979, a second cen-
sus of potlery was taken in the same village. Accurate estimates of ceramic use-life, based upon a
sample of more than 1,100 pots, are now possible. Data on various types and sizes of pots sug-
gest some generalizations and changed frequencies in the ceramic assemblage are clearly
reflective of changed economic factors. (12)

Lord, K. (Esca-Tech.) INVERTEBRATE FAUNAL REMAINS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHEL-
TER, WASHINGTON COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. A large number of ter-
restrial gastropods (land snails) and naiads (freshwater mussels) were recovered during the ex-
cavations at Meadowcroft Rockshelter (36WH297). Land snails are of particular importance in at-
tempts to reconstruct paleoenvironmental conditions at and near the site because of their habitat
requirements. Freshwater mussels also reflect environmental parameters. However, their
presence at Meadowcroft is due to human selection and transport. Consequently, mussels also
monitor cultural variables. It appears that mussels present in the Meadowcroft assemblage have
both local and more distant origins. Thé place of the data from the invertebrate fauna in the larger
reconstruction of paleoenvironment in the Cross Creek drainage and specifically at Meadowcroft
| Rockshelter itself is discussed. (45)

Lothrop, Jonathan C. (SUNY-Binghamton) PIECES ESQUILLEES FROM THE VAIL SITE: TECHNO-
FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR PALEOINDIAN STUDIES. Piéces esquillées were first ob-
served in Old World assemblages 75 years ago, and archaeologists there have widely ack-
nowledged the bone-wedging function ascribed to them. These tools are often present in Paleo-
indian site assemblages in North America, but in most cases either have escaped recognition or
have been misdiagnosed as exhausted cores. The Vail Paleoindian site in Oxford County, north-
western Maine, has produced a sample of several hundred piéces esquillées, thereby enabling in-
tensive study of this oft-neglected tool class. Attribute and metric analyses are presented which
substantiate arguments for a bone-wedging function of these tools. (35)
Lothrop, Joy Mahler TEXTILES FROM THE CENOTE OF SACRIFICE AT CHICHEN ITZA. The late
Edward H. Thompson dredged the Cenote between 1904 and 1907 and among other treasures, he
salvaged over 700 textile fragments. Each piece was analyzed as to nature of the yarn, spinning
direction, warp weft counts and classified as to structure, weaving techniques and designs.
Though the bulk of the fragments are unadorned plain weaves, there is ample evidence to claim a
highly skilled textile tradition existed in this late period. Some historical background, questions
concerning the original state of the cloth and some comparative material are also offered. (17)
Lubensky, Ear! H. (Missouri) THE HUANCAVILCAS IN THE GUAYAS BASIN. The Huancavilca, ac-
cording to Spanish conquerors, inhabited the area around Guayaquil and the southern Guayas
area at the time of contact. Their exact location and their relationship with other peoples in the
area has not been clear, and even the name assigned to them has been a source of confusion. Ex-
cavation of an Integration Period cemetery on the Hacienda Ayalan in the Guayas delta region
may shed some light on the mixture of cultural phases in this overlapping boundary area between
what is called the Milagro-Quevedo phase on the east and the Huancavilca, Mantefio or Southern
Mantefio on the west. (30)
Lurie, Rochelle (Northwestern) MEASURING EFFICIENCY IN THE USE OF LITHIC MATERIALS.
Time and energy invested in stone tool manufacture are not simply products of evolution or of in-
creasing technological knowhow, but are responses to the nature and availability of resources,
and competition for these resources. A shift in hunter-gatherer mobility patterns at the Koster
Site suggests a change in resource utilization which may have required increased efficiency in
tool manufacture and use. The diversity and standardization of tools, the ratio of shaped tools to
utilized flakes and cobbles and the specialized use of expensive raw material are used to monitor
possible change. (13)

Lynott, Mark J. (National Park Service) WOODLAND PERIOD ADAPTIVE PATTERNS IN NORTH-
ERN MINNESOTA. Two seasons of archaeological survey and site testing in Voyageurs National
Park -have provided evidence pertaining to Middle and Late Woodland adaptation in the northern
lake country, The sites are located on the margins of large lakes and appear to represent intermit-
‘ tent occupations of varying duration. Based upon thermoluminescence dating of ceramics, the
area appears to have been intensively occupied for the last 2,000 years. Palynological study of
lake sediment cores have produced a record of changing vegetation that corresponds to this
period and documents a trend toward cooler conditions during the period from 550 BP to 100 BP.
Subsistence patterns reflected in vertebrate faunal remains are oriented toward exploitation of
birds, fish, reptiles and mammals. identification of fossil phytoliths provides evidence of wild rice
exploitation, The regional settlement system seems to reflect mobile populations involved in a
seasonally oriented pattern of aggregation and dispersal. (16)
MacNeish, Richard S. (Peabody Foundation) NORTHERN BELIZE PRECERAMIC. This is an in-
troductory statement about the preceramic of Northern Belize on the basis of a season's survey
(1980) and two small excavations (1981). Even though work is still progressing as of now (1982) six
preceramic sites are being excavated. We already have the outlines of cultural sequences of five
complexes from roughly 9000 to 2000 BC. This sequence sees a shift from injand hunters to Ar-
chaic inland collectors on to the Melinda complex with a maritime orientation and finally to the
Progreso complex that seems maritime and riverine adapted. The latter seems ancestral to the
Maya phases with ceramics. (3)
Magennis, Ann L. and Debra L. Martin (Massachusetts) MICROSCOPIC TECHNIQUES FOR
OSSUARY ANALYSIS: AN EXAMPLE FROM CAPE COD, MASSACHUSETTS. Analysis of skeletal
remains from ossuary burials presents special problems for bioarchaeologists. Visual methods
for assessment of population characteristics such as age and sex, disease and nutritional status
often yield frustratingly incomplete information. The utility of microscopic aging techniques for
ossuary samples has been demonstrated. Moreover, a recent study has shown that histological
analysis of thinsections can also be a valuable means of segregating individuals. Both macro-

Malpass, Michael A. (Wisconsin) PRECERAMIC SUBSISTENCE TECHNOLOGIES ALONG THE
NORTH CENTRAL COAST OF PERU. Recent fieldwork by the author at preceramic sites near a
large Joma formation south of the Casma valley has yielded detailed information concerning the
lithic artifacts used for the exploitation of this unique resource zone. A lack of tools normally
associated with terrestrial hunting, combined with the presence of grinding stones and other
tools generally considered to be for pliant processing, suggests an orientation principally toward
the flora rather than fauna of the loma. The assemblages are very similar to those from
preceramic sites farther south, but very different from reported highland sites, suggesting closer
cultural affinities with the former. (46)
Marks, Anthony E. and Harold Hietala (Southern Methodist) FROM MIDDLE TO UPPER PALEO-

lithic transition. The major changes are from a radiating to a circulating settlement pattern. Par-
ticular attention is paid to intrasite variability during the crucial period of the transition, dated at
Boker Tachtit to ca. 45,000 BC. The spatial data suggest a shift from activity specific loci in the
earliest occupation to generalized activity loci in the latest occupation. (6)
Marquardt, William H. (South Carolina) ADVANCING THE UNDERSTANDING OF LATE PLEISTO-

from living societies, and an appreciation for the dynamism and complexity of their sites, ar-
chaeologists are closer than ever before to an understanding of Late Pleistocene/Holocene
hunter-gatherers. Advances in understanding the “Archaic” and the ''Mesolithic” are reviewed
critically, considering theory and method as well as factual knowledge. It is suggested that in-
adequate explanations may result if consideration is not given to the built-in biases of some of
our models. Some reorientations are suggested, and a plea is made for a broader perspective and
more critical discourse between Americans and Europeans. (2)
Martin, Debra L., Alan C. Swediund and George J. Armelagos (Massachusetts) POPULATION
DYNAMICS, RESOURCES AND SKELETAL BIOLOGY ON BLACK MESA. The causes and effects
of population change on Black Mesa, Arizona (700-1150 AD) have yet to be fully understood. In
order to assess the importance of any one variable on population dynamics, an integrative
framework utilizing skeletal analysis is proposed. This paper defines how skeletal biology can ar-
ticulate with archaeological reconstruction in the interpretation of environmental, nutritional and
| disease processes, and of population responses to stress. The existence of age- and sex-related
stress indicators, as well as the presence of differential frequencies through time have been
demonstrated. The occurrence of enamel! defects, growth arrest lines, porotic hyperostosis, ma-
jor trace element deficiencies and increased rates of bone turnover suggest that stressors of a
seasonal nature were present, and that these stressors amplified through time, with the greatest
severity and biological involvement occurring at the time of abandonment. These interpretations,
combined with the data from floral and faunal analysis and the environmental! reconstruction, will
| increase the ability of bioarchaeologists to test the hypothesis of population change. (44)

THE LANGE/FERGUSON (39SH33) CLOVIS KILL SITE. This fossiliferous locality contains an in-
termixed, localized concentration of both large and small bones. Larger taxa include at least two
individuals of Mammuthus columbi, Bison and ?cervid. Elements of these taxa appear to have
been butchered although the larger elephant remains partially articulated, and articulation of the

snakes, birds, insectivores, rabbits, gophers, cricetids, zapodids, muskrat and microtines. The
microtines and anurans are the most abundant taxa, and many specimens consist of articulated
or associated skeletons. Almost all of these taxa, their preservation and the enclosing sediment
indicate a community proximal to quiet water. (34)
Martin, Larry D. (Kansas) THE EFFECT OF THE END OF THE PLEISTOCENE ON MAN IN THE
NEW WORLD. The climatic change at the end of the Pleistocene in North America culminated
with the disruption and extinction of the late Pleistocene communities. The total diversity of
plants and animals was reduced in all areas. These changes were the result of the development
of a more seasonal climate, and must Have forced hunting and gathering activities to become
more restricted. A seasonal climate with hot and possibly arid summers and cold winters would

require an increase in the ability to preserve and store food or water and/or an increase in
seasonal mobility. (19)
Martin, Paul S. and Robert S. Thompson (Arizona) GROUND SLOTH EXTINCTION AND THE
BLITZKRIEG MODEL. The Shasta ground sloth (Nothrotheriops) was the smallest of the extinct
North American genera. In the Pleistocene it ranged trom Florida to Oregon. Its distinctive dry
dung balls have been found between 350 and 2000m elevation in eight southwestern caves. Diet
analysis indicates little or no grass and a variety of browse, especially Malyaceae and Ephdra.
The youngest of 16 radiocarbon dates younger than 11.5 ka fall within two '"C standard devia-
tions of 11 ka, the time of Clovis mammoth hunters. Rate of dung deposition and diet prior to ex-
tinction does not suggest a population in natural decline or suffering obvious stress. (19)
Mayer-Oakes, William J. (Texas Tech) SCHOLARS AND THE DISCIPLINE—A STRUCTURAL AP-
PROACH TO ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH VARIETY AND ITS DEVELOPMENT. The ar-
chaeological discipline is now at an early stage of maturity. It has achieved a new level of intra-
disciplinary team capability. Using eight variables derived from the core concepts “discipline”
and “scholar,” a structural analysis is presented to explain the new status. Accepting this view
leads to a new perspective on the evolution of U.S. archaeology. Presented schematically, this
perspective suggests parallels between public and academic archaeology as well as parallels to
the evolution of another American social phenomenon. Jazz history is used comparatively to
briefly consider the role of “schools” and “individuals” in the development of U.S. archaeology.

McCarthy, John P. (Temple) EXAMINING SOCIOCULTURAL VARIATION: AN APPROACH TO THE
ARCHAEOLOGY OF URBAN AMERICA. In the past, urban archaeology has been defined as the
study of changes to the morphology of the city. More recent work has turned toward the examina-
tion of urban society. In this paper the author presents an approach to the investigation of socio-
cultural variation through the study of the urban archaeological record. It is suggested that
historical documentation can be used to link variation in the archaeological record to social,
cultural and functional variations in the archaeological record across time and space. The result
is a firmer understanding of particular sociocultural phenomena and the effects of such
phenomena on the archaeological record. (32)
McCartney, Allen P. (Arkansas) REEVALUATION OF METAL USE BY THULE ESKIMOS OF THE |
CANADIAN ARCTIC. Iron and copper in low frequency are common to classic Thule winter camp
sites of the Canadian Arctic. These infrequently traded pieces suggest that metal had little
significance to manufacturing or subsistence activities. However, direct and indirect evidence of
manufacturing found at Thule sites strongly imply that metal was used extensively as graving
tool blades which replaced earlier Dorset and Pre-Dorset stone burin blades. Metal curation was
primarily responsible for limited presence at sites. The expansion of Thule Eskimos from Alaska
must be viewed as a new manufacturing, as well as a new subsistence, adaptation to the central
Arctic. (27)

PREHISTORIC WATER MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF SOUTHWEST ECUADOR, Recent extensive
excavation of one of the largest of a series of more than 100 prehistoric earthen catch basins
located in the semi-arid zone of the Santa Elena Peninsula in southwest Ecuador validates a
method of dating the construction and use of these structures, which were a system of managing
and conserving fresh water. Present evidence suggests that the basins became progressively
smaller and more numerous, their location shifting from La Libertad west to the Santa Rosa area.
A concomitant and repeated shift possibly reflects environmental modulations and/or evolu-

McGuire, Randall H. and Robert S. Sternberg (Arizona) A REVISION OF THE VIRTUAL GEOMAG-
NETIC POLE CURVE FOR THE U.S. SOUTHWEST (AD 1100-1400) AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR
ARCHAEOMAGNETIC DATING. Over 158 archaeomagnetic samples have been collected from 73
sites in the U.S. Southwest. Seventy-three features are independently dated by tree-ring, C-14 and
ceramic dates between AD 700-1450, with the densest data between AD 1100-1400. A VGP was
constructed by computing weighted average directions and percisions within a moving window.
The results are generally similar to Dubois’ (1975) VGP curve but our curve is smoother and it runs
about 100 years ahead of Dubois’ from AD 900-1200. This would correct the surprisingly late ar-
chaeomagnetic dates determined on the basis of Dubois’ curve for the abandonment of Chaco
Canyon and the Sacaton phase of the Hohokam Root. (47)

HOUSEHOLD PATTERNS. Between the mid-19th century and early 20th century a number of
changes occurred in the lifestyle of the Piman Indians of Arizona. Two major factors responsible
for this were the political intervention of the government and the increasing involvement in the
Anglo cash economy. These acculturative changes are reflected in the organization of the Piman
household complex and can be traced through archaeological and ethnographic research tech-
niques. They are seen in the gradual constriction of the physical complex size, in the increasing
emphasis on indoor rather than outdoor living and in the rearrangement of traditional facilities to
accommodate newly acquired activities. (26)
McManamon, Francis P. (National Park Service) SITE DISCOVERY TECHNIQUES IN AREAS OF
DENSE GROUND COVER. Surface inspection during pedestrian survey, the traditional technique
of site discovery in lightly vegetated and heavily cultivated portions of the world, is not an effec-
tive technique in areas of dense ground cover. Chemical tests, resistivity tests, magnetometry
and remote sensing have been suggested as site discovery techniques. Subsurface tests with a
wide range of shapes and volumes have been used as site discovery techniques. Some of these
techniques, notably larger-sized test pits, are effective discovery of all but very small archaeo-
logical sites. This seems to be so because they are large enough to encompass diffusely
distributed artifacts or artifact clusters within site areas. (47)

have greatly augmented what was already a serious probiem for many institutions—the care of

and certain requirements for facilities. The recent rehabilitation of the curatorial facilities of the

Merrick, H. J. (Harvard) AGAINST THE GRAIN: THE SIGNIFICANCE OF ETHNIC NONCON-

sites in urban contexts, archaeologists must deal with problems of assimilation and rapid

assemblages (in this case, refuse) ofboth dominant and minority cultures within shared
economic strata before one can attempt to determine the degree of dissimilarity in the use of con-

sumable goods by such groups. By using comparative data in this way, the extent of ethnic non-
conformity or resistance to assimilation may be seen as one of the principal criteria for assess-
ing site significance. (32)

munities have not changed significantly in the recent past. In the American Southwest major
shifts in the native vegetation have been documented since the wide introduction of cattle in the
late 1800s, so this approach is invalid. For the Salt-Gila Archaeological Project in southern

Arizona plant communities for the period 1880-1910 were first reconstructed using historical

data to provide an interpretive baseline. Then using climatic, ecological and archaeological data,

these associations were extrapolated backward to cover the period between 700 and 1400 AD.

These reconstructed communities will be used in studies of resource availability, foraging

strategy, agricultural techniques and environmental manipulation. (5)

Miller, Peter S. (High Plains Consultants) THE BIG BUSINESS OF SMALL-SCALE SURVEYS.

Small survey work accounts for 4 major portion of the funding for archaeology in the western

United States. There has been a very rapid rise of private companies that emphasize this kind of

archaeology. The intense competition for this work is resulting in management methods and ap-
proaches that academic programs are poorly organized to match. Most archaeologists are either
unaware of this activity or find it anathema to their interests. This paper discusses the develop-
ment of big business in small-scale archaeology and the directions it is taking. (40)

Moore, James A. (Queens) ARCHAEOLOGICAL MODELS, METAPHORS AND SOCIAL CHANGE.
For American archaeologists the study of social organization has revolved around two issues: the
recognition of social groups and the identification of social positions in these groups. In these
tasks the archaeologist has been relatively successful. However, the research program of ethnog-
raphy with a shovel has been much less successful in dealing with the issue of social change. .
Ecological, demographic and information-handling orientations have provided processual routes ;
to the study of social change. Each orientation is based on a metaphor which posits a specific
drive for social change. By combining these sometimes contradictory drives a more dynamic and
dialectic notion of social change can be developed. Data from the Swedish Neolithic are used to
demonstrate this approach. (2)

devised to evaluate the role of these artifacts in the technological system. The processes of pro-

ceramic occupation with a lithic assemblage designed for the exploitation of forest and other
plant resources, and an intensive and extensive Formative occupation, which shares many traits
with Tropical Forest cultures of Amazonia. These adaptive strategies characterize later occupa-
“tions of the forested area. (46)

usually required to ascertain whether a given technique is suitable for a particular environmental
setting and archaeological problem. Results of a magnetometer survey to detect subsurface re-
mains on preceramic Basketmaker II sites on Black Mesa, Arizona, are discussed. The tested
sites represent different types of magnetic environments and suggestions are offered for rapidly

situated in the confluence of the creek and the Chattahoochee River, received a cursory exam-
ination by the Columbus Museum in the late 1950s. Most of the site remained above Lake Eufaula
created by Walter F. George Lock and Dam. In subsequent years river bank erosion began to
destroy the site. The mitigation of this adverse impact by the Mobile District, U.S. Army Corps of

vehicle for carrying out this mandate. Although such projects remain important, other aspects of

ruins stabilization are now emerging in the National Park Service. These include annual and
cyclical maintenance programs, as well as the use of archaeologists as part of multidisciplinary
teams. The ways that archaeologists can contribute to an overall program must relate to both the
planning and completion of preservation projects and the various forms of ruins maintenance.

Nurkin, Gary H. (Chicago-Kent College of Law) THE CONSERVATION OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL
RESOURCES: FEDERAL LEGISLATION. During the past 80 years Congress has enacted two
specific statutes to conserve archaeological remains. The first statute was designed to regulate
excavations on public lands, The second statute modified and expanded the protection offered
by the first through regulating not only the excavation of archaeological resources but also the
sale, exchange or transport of these artifacts. These two acts are insufficient because they fail to
protect archaeological remains located on private property. Expanding the scope of these acts to
include the protection of archaeological resources located on private property increases their ef-
fectiveness in conserving archaeological remains. (48)

method for studying the evolution of tribal organization in which complementary anthropological
and archaeological models are compared and tested using data on the New York lroquois. The

for the evolution of tribal level sociocultural integration which can be further tested with specific

Paynter, Robert (Mass.) FIELD OR FACTORY? CONCERNING THE DEGRADATION OF AR-

series of accountable tasks. A similar process occurred in more traditional workplaces with the
shift from craft to trade production. Comparing cases from 19th century workplaces and recent
archaeological manuals leads to the conclusion that different imperatives structure each trans-
formation. Finally, CRM work is not wedded to the profit motive and is more closely allied to
academic archaeology in the production of 20th century ideologies concerning the past. (31)

Peebles, Christopher S. (IPP-Amsterdam) SOCIAL EVOLUTION AND DEVOLUTION AT MOUND-
VILLE: THE VIEW FROM THE ECONOMY. The evolution of the complex, ranked, hierarchical |
social and settlement system that characterized the Moundville phase (AD 1050-1500) in west
central Alabama was accompanied by equally complex developments in its economic system. At
its zenith, the Moundville economy encompassed the flow of tribute from periphery to the center,
rudimentary craft specialization, a prestige-goods sector and a widespread exchange network.
These aspects of the economy, all of which were supported by (but above and beyond) the sub-
sistence sector, seem to have been monopolized by the “elite.” When the limits to the “social
surplus" were reached, it was these secondary and tertiary aspects of the economy that failed
7 first, and precipitated the devolution to a less complex form of social organization. (2)
Pendergast, David M. (Royal Ontario Museum) THE POSTCLASSIC IN NORTHERN BELIZE. Little-
understood prior to the 1970s, the Postclassic of northern Belize can now be seen to have em-
bodied surprising richness and variety in which distinctive local styles are blended with traits
that link the communities of the area with those farther north in the Yucatan. Excavation data
document a continuum from Classic and earlier times through the latter part of the 17th century,
and permit us to recognize patterns that link individual community histories. From such recog-
nition comes an understanding of some of the dynamics of change and the forces behind con-
tinuity in northern Belize, as well as of the place of the region in Lowland Maya prehistory during
the Postclassic. (3)

Powell. Shirley (Southern Iilinois) FOOD STORAGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNCERTAINTY: AN
EXAMPLE FROM BLACK MESA, ARIZONA. Models of cultural change employing 4 theoretical
ecological framework recognize that individuals and populations seek to maintain themselves
ender conditions of environmental change. Responses to environmental perturbations can be
hierarchically and inclusively classified and the order in which they are activated can be
oredicted: superficial, individual responses will be enacted prior to embedded, group responses.
This theoretical orientation will be used to retrodict changes in technology and organization tor

foodstuffs is predicted to occur initially on the individual or household level; if this response is

DEVELOPMENT ON SEDENTARINESS. In discussing cultural sequences, archaeologists tend to

This paper proposes a definition of sedentariness and evaluates the reliability of a series of
archaeologically-recoverable indicators of its development. No one kind of evidence is con-
clusive, but the appearance of a complex of indicators in an archaeological sequence can allow 4
convincing argument to be made that the group in question has become sedentary. (21)

measures of population are frequently based on ethnographic estimates. The debate is outlined.
Late prehistoric and early historic settlement records from central New York, Lower Mississippi
Valley and upper Missour\ Trench are employed to build regional descriptions of demographic
change that are independent of ethnographic estimates. All records indicate catastrophic
population loss prior to sustained European colonization. Disease is the only variable that could
cause such decline; Dobyns’ position is supported. (23)

Randsborg, Klaus (Copenhagen) HISTORICAL PROCESSES AND CULTURE CHANGE. The con-
cept of historical process as representing the “noise” in an adaptive social system is hardly
understandable to most European archaeologists who tend to ignore “history” for the study of
patterns of culture and economy. A case can be made for seeing all acts of behavior as being
historical and for cultural and social phenomena as a universe governed by actions of various
strengths and directions which repeatedly are constrained by other factors. The study of culture
change in this manner has been hampered by the methodological difficulties of determining
cause and effect. The theoretical and methodological aspects of studying the role of historical
factors in culture change will be exemplified through an examination of the Roman period and
earlier Middle ages (Viking) period in Scandinavia. (2)
Raphael, Bettina (SAR) CONSERVATION IN THE FIELD. The proper care and preservation of ar-
chaeological materials should begin in the field, as the artifact is excavated from its environment
and prepared for transport and temporary storage. Conservation planning and budgeting should
be part of the earliest stages of designing any archaeological project. Archaeologists traditional-
ty have not been adequately trained to anticipate and cope with the special handling, packing and
preservation needs particularly of perishable specimens, There are practical protective measures
that the archaeological field crew can take to prevent irreparable damage to an artifact when itis
recovered and to keep it stable for future analysis or until more extensive preservation treatment
can be carried out by a professional conservator. (54)

ferences between sheep and goats. The sheep/goat ratio reflects decisions made by herders
besed on characteristics of the animals (by sex, age and species), and the environmental and
economic variable states. Decisions made are goal-directed. Optimization models were used to
obtain sets of predictions for a series of environmental states for six hypothetical goals. Tests in-

of short-term droughts increased. The transformation of Woodland foragers into Caddoan hor-
*eulturalists between AD 650 and 950 reflects efforts to sustain high population densities in a
dg@creasingly predictable environment. Small aceramic “Late Woodland” or Plains Village’ com-
pements in the Cross Timbers probably are the seasonal hunting camps of early Caddoans
operating out of game-depleted horticultural core areas to the southeast, an interpretation sup-
ported by excavation of a small winter base camp composed of semisubterranean “hothouse”

Renfrew, Colin (Cambridge, England) PEER POLITY INTERACTION AS AN ANALYTICAL FRAME.
The concept of peer polity interaction designates a frequently undervalued agent of social and
political change. Most models currently employed to explain social transformations focus either
on core/periphery (primary/secondary) relationships where one polity is in a position of
dominance, or examine the organizational changes taking place within a single polity in response
to population growth or other factors. But the interchanges taking place between a number of
politically autonomous units situated within a single region are often of determining importance
for the growth trajections as well as for the emerging ethnic consciousness and the ‘style’ of the
culture or civilization. (36)

understand local seasonality, the better to organize their farming activities so to increase the
likelihood of adequate food production. This calendar could have also been used to improve
chances for success in hunting-gathering. Analyses of Mesa Verde sites indicate that the people
devised a solar calendar which they incorporated into architectural features at several pueblos.

a subject largely passed over in the literature. This paper attempts to explain their distribution be-
tween Point Barrow (Nuwuk), Utkiavik and Walakpa Bay and to uncover regularities in terms of
social or familial affiliations. It has been suggested that the inhabitants of Walakpa Bay may
have been related to those of Nuwuk. Because Utkiavik is situated between the two, it provides an
excellent data base with which to test this hypothesis. Both intra-site and inter-site similarities
and variability will be examined to determine crucial linkages between settlements. (28)

periods and regions. Current approaches are either not widely applicable or are too time consum-
ing for widespread use, This paper considers one method for community pattern analysis which
can be used efficiently on large bodies of data and which generates comparable results across

_ GHURCH, AN IDEATIONAL-BEHAVIORAL APPROACH. The ideational-behavior approach sees
material culture as a form of symbolic communication, a text, by which people both shape and
express the experiences of social interaction. Spanish Americans create a sense of the sacred
‘ out of their experiences by grounding the sacred in the sensuousness of place, and their iglesia
becomes a temple, Southern Baptists establish a sense of the sacred through deemphasizing
place and stressing the word, and their church becomes an auditorium. Applied to archaeological
data, the approach suggests that the archaeologist become an interpretive reader who deciphers
artifactual remains to gain access to the public meaning the remains communicate. (26)

Missouri Ozarks are geographically contiguous with areas where Woodland period culture
change is well marked, yet the prehistoric Ozarkers seem to have been largely unaffected by

Rowley-Conwy, Peter (Cambridge) EUROPE FROM THE END OF THE LAST GLACIAL TO THE
START OF FARMING. The contemporary view that the European Mesolithic was characterized by
small, mobile groups is oversimplified because of two unfounded assumptions: (1) that the
deciduous forest was a hostile environment and (2) that hunter societies do not have the social
mechanisms to maintain large, permanent settlements. This notion of Mesolithic society
underlies the conception that sedentism in “subneolithic” groups was a precursor to farming.
The alternative view that Mesolithic sedentism occurred in the areas of favorable environments and
that permanently settled groups in these areas may account for the delay of the spread of farm-
ing is presented. (2)
Rubertone, Patricia E. (Brown) MEASURING ORGANIZATION: EXAMPLES FROM URBAN AR-
CHAEOLOGICAL RESEARCH. Trends in the archaeological study of cities indicate greater em-
phasis on questions of urban organization and organizational change through time. Of specific
concern to archaeologists is the issue of developing measures of organizational complexity and
identifying suitable material correlates in the archaeological record. Urban historical archaeol-
ogy can contribute to this research since the rich documentary Sources associated with this ur-
ban archaeological data base offer excellent controls for testing notions of urban organization
and change, and for evaluating its archaeological correlates. Several measures of urban organi-
zation in terms of population, economics and integration are discussed. Examples are drawn
from urban archaeological research in Providence. (32)

ly produced microwear on bone in the reconstruction of butchering and tool manufacture and use
practices. While most previous studies have concentrated on the action with which the tool is
used, these experiments focus on the contact material. Microscopic examination reveals distinc-

teraction between a number of Early State Modules. However, this paper focuses on peer polity
interaction during the Late Classic period to demonstrate that the model has potential ex-

social, material, and symbolic ties among the Late Classic polities which could have reinforced
their interdependence. (36)

Sabo, George III (Arkansas Archeological Survey) THE HUNTSVILLE SITE (3MA22), A CADDOAN
CIVIC-CEREMONIAL CENTER IN THE ARKANSAS OZARKS. The Ozark Highland has long been
regarded as a geographically isolated area which during late prehistoric times remained
peripheral to and largely unaffected by Mississippian cultural developments in surrounding
regions. This paper presents the results of recent excavations at the Huntsville site (3MA22), 4
Caddoan civic-ceremonial center situated well within the Arkansas Ozarks. The presence at this
site of a multistage substructural mound, plus the occurrence of corn and squash, attest to the
emergence of Mississippian subsistence-settiement systems in the region. These findings add to
a growing body of evidence concerning Mississippian adaptations to highland environments. (39)
Saitta, Dean J. (Massachusetts) THE EXPLANATION OF CHANGE IN EGALITARIAN SOCIETY: A
CRITIQUE, Several researchers have recently explained changes in the archaeological record of
, Sattenspiel, Lisa 81
egalitarian societies in terms of an evolutionary process of increasing social integration under
conditions of increasing environmental stress (e.g. Braun 1980; Plog 1980). These explanations
are problematic in that they are based on methodology, stylistic analysis of domestic ceramics,
which is inappropriate for tracking the organizational processes of concern. This methodology
ratlects more basic difficulties with the conceptual framework accompanying it. By redressing
these difficulties we may be led to a more mature theory of social process in egalitarian society.
An alternative conceptual framework is discussed and illustrated with reference to the archaeo-
logical record of the midwestern United States. (39)

Sampson, C. Garth (Southern Methodist) SPATIAL ORGANIZATION OF SAN BUSHMEN SITES IN
THE ZEEKOE VALLEY, SOUTH AFRICA, The Zeekoe Valley, a tributary of the Orange River in cen-
tral South Africa, has been intensively surveyed to test models of hunter-gatherer spatial organiza-
tion. Preliminary analysis of more than 5,000 San Bushman (Smithfield) sites suggests that
although they represent a single ethnographically documented culture, the archaeological record
contains evidence delineating a series of band territories within the larger valley settlement area.
The study of San sites forms a bridge linking the data on recent hunters with the Paleolithic past.
The San settlement model, coupled with paleoecological studies, provides new insights into the
distribution and adaptive strategies employed in more than 4,000 pre-San sites in the valley, rang-
«ng in age from the Wilton to the Acheulean. (18)

paper will deal with the nature of Chavin's administrative structure in the Callejon de Huaylas.
This will be approached by analyzing the quantity, morphology and distribution of public ar-

Sant, Mark B. and Barbara D. Stafford (Center for American Archeology) SITE STRUCTURE AND
SUNCTION IN THE MIDDLE WOODLAND: AN EXAMPLE FROM SMILING DAN. Smiling Dan, a
Middle Woodland habitation site, does not correspond to the traditional models of Middle
Woodland settlement. These traditional models are examined in light of functional analysis of
Whic and ceramic artifacts and the depositional patterns of refuse (primary vs. secondary refuse)
trom Smiling Dan. These data are used to determine site function/settlement type. To accomplish
this goal, spatial localities which may represent domestic units are segregated within the site.
The validity of this segregation is tested both functionally and chronologically. These problems
must initially be examined on individual sites in order to gain a better understanding of the Mid-
@ie Woodland from a regional perspective. (1)

answer this question whole tools from several components at the Koster Site were intuitively
lassified. Then artifact classes were generated from a number of attributes which reflect
manufacture and use of groundstone tools. The two methods of classification are compared in
this paper. (39)

ment strategies, oriented primarily toward caribou, seal and/or musk-oxen, may reflect attempts
to maintain social patterns previously established within a predominantly bowhead whale based
subsistence framework. The nature of these strategies and the implications in examining the
‘decline’ of Thule culture and transition to historic Inuit cultures in this area are discussed. (56)
Schelberg, John D. (National Park Service) THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOCIAL COMPLEXITY IN
CHACO CANYON. The sociopolitical complexity of the Chacoan Anasazi in Chaco Canyon, New
Mexico, was the result of an adaptation to a stressed environment of low productivity and low
predictability. Other investigations believe that the surrounding region was populated by im-
migrants from the canyon during Pueblo Ill; however, many of the known Chacoan outlying com-
munities show jn situ growth beginning 550 years earlier. The kind of relationship between the
canyon and the region and the level of complexity will be considered. Rather than complexity ap-
pearing in Pueblo lll as a qualitatively different phenomenon, it is argued that the earliest
agricultural population was more complex than previously suspected and that the transition from
Basketmaker to Pueblo was one of degree rather than kind. (23)

Schenck, Helen (MASCA) METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS OF IRON FROM CATOCTIN, MARYLAND.
Many iron producing and working sites in this country have been investigated archaeologically,
but at few of these have the products, waste and finished, been subjected to the kinds of
metallurgical analyses that would discover their composition and the manufacturing techniques
by which they were created. Answering these questions would enable the archaeologist to draw
important conclusions about the technological processes going on at the site as well as the effi-
ciency of the manufacturer. The Museum Applied Science Center for Archaeology at the Universi-
ty Museum, Philadelphia, has undertaken a program of such metallurgical analyses on slag,
casting waste and finished cast iron artifacts from the early 19th century iron working complex at
Catoctin, Maryland. This paper presents the results of those analyses. (27)

Schneider, Fred (North Dakota) AN INTERPRETATION OF PALEOINDIAN CULTURES IN NORTH
DAKOTA. Recent investigations of Paleoindian sites and artifacts in North Dakota indicate the
presence of a wide range of projectile point types ranging from Clovis through those of the Cody
Complex. There are no excavated Paleoindian artifacts in North Dakota, no known associations
of these artifacts with extinct fauna and no radiocarbon dates or stratigraphic associations of
these materials. All artifacts are from surface collections. Despite these shortcomings, analysis

* — of the distribution of these artifacts indicates a concentration west of the Missouri Coteau and

substantiates a regional model of the distribution and spread of Paleoindian cultures to the north
and east. (53)

Schoenberg, Kenneth M. (National Park Service) THE ARCHAEOLOGY OF KURUPA LAKE. As a
result of a survey of the Kurupa Lake Region, central Brooks Range, over 50 sites were discov-
ered. The sites appear to represent cultural traditions from the American Paleoarctic up to the
Historic period. A second field season spent at KIR-124, a multi component site located at the
south end of Kurupa Lake, revealed a classic Denbigh component, as well as an Historic and an
Arctic Tundra Tradition component. Several side-notched points indicate the presence of the
Northern Archaic Tradition. The second season's work suggested the possibility that this site
represents a Natvakruak complex such as described by Campbell from the Anktuvuk Pass area.

Schreiber, Katharina J. (Arizona State Museum) CHANGING SETTLEMENT PATTERNS IN THE
SOUTH CENTRAL HIGHLANDS OF PERU. Results of the 1981 settlement pattern study of the
Carahuarazo Valley of the south central highlands of Peru are presented. From its initial occupa-
tion at the end of the Early Horizon, through the Colonial period, a number of shifts occurred in
settlement location, the most dramatic during the Middle Horizon. It is suggested that this shift |
was correlated with, but not necessarily caused by, the expansion of the Huari state. Differences
between Huari and Inca occupations of the region are evident, suggesting that their political and
economic organizations might have been quite different in nature. (46)

closed a succession of prehistoric occupations ranging from Paleoindian through Mississippian
times. The paleoenvironmental studies have been keyed towards reconstructions of the
floodplain microenvironments that prevailed during each period, Geoarchaeological methods
have identified sedimentary and pedogenic intervals that are associated with particular land-
forms. Reconstructions were integrated with faunal, ethnobotanical, and palynological data

Sciulli, P. W. (Ohio State) HUMAN REMAINS FROM MEADOWCROFT ROCKSHELTER, WASH-

shelter (36WH297) are rare and include only one possible interment and 32 isolated occurrences
of individual bones, bone fragments or teeth. All human material, with two exceptions, is con-
fined to Stratum IIb or above. Currently, these two specimens represent the earliest well dated
human remains in the Northeast. The osteological remains are noteworthy in their lack of major
variations and pathologies. The only case of a well defined bone pathology (FS 81-1), porotic
hyperostosis, appears to be fairly common in an intensively studied Late Woodland population
(Mensforth et al. 1978). The teeth recovered from Meadowcroft Rockshelter are perhaps most
notable for their lack of major pathologies and variations (if attrition is considered a natural
biological process). Neither caries nor abnormalities in tooth size or shape are present in the
sample. While relatively little comparative data is present for the root analysis, the present sam-
ple again shows little variation from the norm (Kovacs 1971). (45)

craft specialization and mass production of chert tools beginning in the Late Preclassic Period.
Data derived from the investigations of chert workshops at Colha, Kunahmul and Chicawate, all
located in the chert bearing zone of northern Belize, are reviewed to illustrate the structure and
production systems of formal utilitarian tools. An examination of the lithic assemblages at
Cuello, Kichpanha, Kokeal and Cerros reveal that these settlements were receiving the products
from the Colha area industries in the Late Preciassic and Classic periods. The social mech-
anisms which served to structure and distribute the chert tools are discussed. (3)

THE CHIPPED STONE ARTIFACTS FROM THE SACRED CENOTE AT CHICH EN ITZA. Despite the
collection's limited size, ongoing analyses permit inferences in such diverse areas as: trade,
cosmology, ritual, acculturation and extractive resource technology. Extensive pyroclastic
damage exhibited by many artifacts implies ritual burning and subsequent immersion in water.
Local materials, as well as exotic obsidian from as far away as Pachuca were used and
deposited. The effects of a Central Mexican presence on indigenous Maya lithics production are
evident and the preservation of original hafting gum on numerous implements is attributed to
their deposition in an aquatic medium. (17)

EUROPE. There is much evidence for social change in Europe in the later third millennium. Childe
explained these developments as a result of diffusion from the east Mediterranean civilizations, |
while Renfrew has argued that they are the result of autonomous local developments. Neither
framework seems satisfactory to account for the convergence of a number of widely separated

the appearance of hierarchies of a similar degree of complexity operating in similar ways. The

paper explores the extent to which concepts of interregional interaction can be explanatory of ;

SOCIETY IN PREHISTORIC EUROPE. Given the considerable progress which has been made in

the theoretical understanding of states, it is a particular problem that the standard evolutionary
sequence from simple to complex society does not seem especially relevant to prehistoric

Europe. This paper will focus mainly on the third millenium and late second millenium BC with
particular reference to the nature of the power base and sociopolitical integration at the time.

This in turn leads to questions about the existence of particular types of institutions and status
positions. The relation of these constructs to archaeological evidence is also addressed. Discus-

sion of this will also include the important question of interregional differences and the reasons

for them. (2)

DURING THE MIDDLE HORIZON IN NORTH PERU. An historical and processual characterization

of the problematical Middle Horizon in North Peru is presented based on data from excavations in

Batan Grande and concomitant ceramic analyses conducted during the past four years. During

AD 600-850 we see complex permutations of the styles and associated ideologies of the contem-
poraneous Wari, Pachacamac and Cajamarca cultures against the background of a Mochicoid

local tradition. Out of this syncretism and stylistic interaction the three coevolving styles of Lam- i
bayeque, pa/eteada and ‘Coastal Cajamarca” emerged. This paper further considers the roles of

the Cajamarca and Pachacamac cultures in these developments. (46)

Shive, James J. (Georgia Power) THE NEEDS OF INDUSTRY. The archaeologist who works for an

that such an individual ceases to be an archaeologist and, indeed, is in a position to be a strong |
advocate for archaeology. In order to pursue this advocacy role, it is important to have the sup-

port and understanding of the archasological profession. This paper will consider the future of ar-
chaeology as it is developing in partnership with various industries that now require the services

of archaeologists. (41)

there were people in the New World before 12,000 BP, certainly by 20,000 BP, probably by 30,000

BP, and possibly by 50,000 BP, with diminishing degrees of confidence. The diagnostic criteria

are: (1) clearly demonstrated and correctly interpreted stratigraphy, (2) multiple radiocarbon dates
collected under rigorously controlled conditions and (3) artifacts of indisputable human manufac-

ture in demonstrable association with radiocarbon dated material. Using these three criteria,

several sites in North and South America are used as examples to illustrate the model. (19)

Silver, Constance S. (Columbia) ROCK ART AS ART: AN APPROACH TO A DIFFICULT CONSER-

VATION PROBLEM. Rock art, pictographs and petroglyphs, are one of the most important

cultural resources in the U.S. However, rock art has rarely received the care and treatment applied

to other artistic works, and as a result, the correct procedural approaches to rock art conser-

vation have not often been followed, Rock art presents three major problems for conservators: (1)
deterioration of stone, (2) deterioration of delicate pigment layers in pictographs and (3) exposure

to the elements, Continuing research and pilot treatments involved an interdisciplinary group of
conservators, cultural resource managers and scientists in efforts to halt deterioration, restore
damaged art and preserve the art for as long as possible. The wide range of situations in which

rock art is found in the United States means that a national interdisciplinary conference between
conservators, cultural resource managers and scientists is now needed if a valuable resource is

not to be lost. (54)

volume sample of sediment measuring 2900 cc was taken from each natural stratum,
microstratum or arbitrary 5 cm or 10 cm level within a natural stratum from every excavated
square at Meadowcroft. These samples were then subjected to flotation either in a water medium
{in the case of non-feature fill) or in hydrogen peroxide (in the case of feature fill or any constant

Smith, Fred H. (Tennessee-Knoxville) CRANIOFACIAL MORPHOLOGY AND THE ARCHAIC-
MODERN HOMO SAPIENS TRANSITION IN EUROPE. The differences in craniofacial morphology
between archaic and modern Homo sapiens may be logically related to the maintenance of an
adaptive complex facilitating extensive loading of the anterior dentition in archaic H. Sapiens.
The craniofacial characteristics of modern H. sapiens can be viewed as the result of selective
trends which take precedence upon reduction of this adaptive necessity. Technological factors
associated with the Middie and Upper Paleolithic are most likely responsible for this reduction.
Finally it is reasonable to believe that the origins of modern H. Sapiens in Europe was an essen-
tially indigenous phenomenon. (6)

which ruled from the 1920s to the 1960s have all but collapsed under the stubborn onslaught of
contradictory archaeological data. As a result, archaeological methods are employed in the for-
mulation of lower to lower-middile range theory at best as well as to illustrate the “culture-historic
process." The paper also discusses the organization of archaeological research in the U.S.S.R.

Spath, Carl D. (Larson-Tibesar Associates) THE FORGOTTEN SEA TRADERS OF LA PUNA,
ECUADOR. Early Spanish accounts indicate that at the time of the Conquest the Pundes of La
Puna area of the Guayas estuary were influential middlemen and long distance sea traders who
were granted the title of “Indians of the Royal Crown” because the Spanish recognized their
strategic importance in maintaining essential commercial networks in northwest South America.
The development of these networks in prehistoric times provided bridges between the blossom-
ing civilizations of Mesoamerica and the Andes. We cannot properly understand the emergence
of these two complex aboriginal civilizations without an appreciation of the maritime skills of the
peoples of the Ecuadorian littoral. (30)

doubt that the specialized production of obsidian artifacts was a major element of the city’s
economy. The distribution and nature of the workshops will be discussed and their role in the
social and economic structure of the city evaluated. (42)

SOCIOECONOMIC MODEL. Data excavated from four Quincy, Massachusetts house sites dating
trom the second half of the 19th century are being used to test socioeconomic correlations
established for the city in the decade 1870-80. Data on consumption patterns, particularly the
value of status items, was correlated with federal census schedule data on family socioeconomic
status, especially occupations. A significant average difference in the value of inventories and
status items was found for the occupational categories of proprietors, farmers, craftsmen and
laborers. Because the archaeological sites were inhabited by people in different occupational
categories they can be used to test the documentary model. (32)

developed at Huari, Peru during the early Middle Horizon. Similar architectural complexes have
been described at Pikillaqta, Viracochapampa, Jargampata, Jincamocco and Azangaro. What are
the Ayacucho Valley antecedents of Huari-style administrative architecture? Is there evidence |
of architectural diffusion from the Ayacucho Valley before the Middle Horizon? Recent excava-
tions at Huari have revealed architectural remains dating to Early Horizon, Early Intermediate and
Middle Horizon Periods. Development of architectural features from individual residential units
to state administrative installation is discussed. Continuity of domestic architectural features
and qualitative change in ceremonial architecture are examined. (46)

distribution, size and locus lithic count at the three major New England Paleoindian sites call for
explanation. An examination of caribou hunter ethnography shows that very large seasonal
gatherings of people can be supported primarily by caribou hunting in certain circumstances. A
consideration of the number of stone tools produced per man-day cf occupation by certain “high
tech" arctic/subarctic hunting groups, coupled with the above considerations, indicates that the
three major Paleoindian sites could represent single seasonal occupations by large groups of
people, or a very limited number of closely spaced large-group reoccupations, (35)

tion in the Lower Illinois Valley, provides an opportunity to study a number of problems concern-
ing site formation processes. The central focus of the paper is on the relationship between site
structure, patterns of refuse disposal and the integration of these structural properties with site
function and models of mobility among early to mid-Holocene hunter-gatherers. The analysis of
the spatial structure of the site is carried out at two levels. First, a formal descriptive analysis
(mapping and statistical) of the point provenienced data is made. Second, results are used to
discriminate among categories of refuse. The type of spatial organization is then used to
evaluate alternatively hypothesized patterns of mobility among hunter-gatherer groups inhabiting
the region. (1)

Stein, Julie K. (Washington) INTERPRETING SEDIMENTS IN CULTURAL SETTINGS. Ar-
chaeologists often attempt to reconstruct the natural environment Surrounding their sites, They
generally restrict their investigations to the vegetation, fauna and geomorphology of the past
regional setting. Few researchers realize that the physical setting within a site may also be ex-
amined. The archaeological deposits contain abundant clues of the cultural activities responsi-
ble for the construction and modification of a site. To discern these activities one must closely
examine the matrix of the site according to the principles of sedimentation. The principles state
that sediments result from the interplay of four factors: (1) source, (2) transportation mechanism,
(3) environment of deposition and (4) postdepositional changes that alter the original character of
the sediment. (50)

assess the role of locational efficiency in producing observed Spatial patterns. Spatial optimiza-
tion can be tested by using geographical techniques, such as the ALLOC V procedure, designed
to determine the optimal location of facilities. Also, the accessiblity of individual features can be
measured by the “degree of circuity” index. An examination of locational efficiency is presented in

CONTROL ON THE SANTA ELENA PENINSULA, ECUADOR. Hundreds of a/barradas, which are

labor until about AD 1950 on the Peninsula. These are part of an old human adaptation to condi-
tions of scarce seasonal rainfall. Excavations in the Albarrada of Achallan show that as early as

the latter half of the Worm Glacial can best be characterized and explained by first contrasting
evidence from the Mousterian and Magdalenian polar extremes of this period. This paper ex-
amines in detail the evidence for substantive differences in technology, settlement pattern, sub-
sistence practices, social organization and cultural expression between these two extremes in
the southern sector of the Franco-Cantabrian region. No abrupt breaks are seen in tracing the tra-
jectory of cultural change during the intervening period which spans the Aurignaco-Perigordian

environmental fluctuation and human population growth are explored and evaluated. (6)

these concepts have been carried out in actual research during the intervening 17 years. An at-
tempt will be made to identify causes for shifts in focus within the program over the years, at-

WASHINGTON COUNTY, SOUTHWESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. Eleven natural strata of widely
varying thickness, composition, texture and depositional characteristics have been distinguished
at Meadowcroft Rockshelter (36WH297) and are assigned numerical designations beginning with
the earliest stratum (|) and proceeding to the latest (XI). All but the deepest of these strata have
produced cultura! features. Charcoal samples from 98 of these features as well as two samples

from basketry fragments were submitted for radiocarbon assay. Seventy of these samples have

been processed of which 22 were too small to count. The results of the remaining 48 assays in-
dicate that the initial occupation of the rockshelter is ascribable to the fifteenth millennium BC,
while the latest radiocarbon assay on historic material is AD 1775 + 50. Currently, Meadowcroft
represents the longest human occupational sequence in eastern North America, As various ob-
jections to the Meadowcroft radiocarbon dates have been voiced, particular attention is devoted
to refuting these observations. (45)

by the character of artifacts recovered from the cenote and the intrasite distribution of similar

Tate, Marcia J. and Bruce E. Rippeteau (Petroleum Information Corporation) CULTURE HISTORY

FROM ENERGY DEVELOPMENT. Corporate archaeology responds to needs such as western

United States energy development. Such needs are not for the convenience of scientific inquiry
and impose research limitations. Constraints to research imposed upon corporate archaeology

include a frequently small scale of inventory, the urgency of field investigations undertaken, the

lack of regional research designs to assist data gathering priorities and reluctance by energy
developers to finance research not directly benefiting their programs. Despite the system's |
imitations, corporate archaeology contributes to knowledge of culture history. Data are being

gathered now rather than being deferred for the considerably uncertain future and areas dictated

for investigation are often those previously neglected by others’ research interests. (40)

significantly greater than the single irrigation system. In combination with the local diversity in
subsistence, settlement structure and style in material culture observable through SGA data, this

supports greater continuity between Preclassic and Classic society than previously believed. The
development of Classic Period Hohokam society as a logical outgrowth of the existing cultural

system is proposed and the implications for regional change are examined. (5)

cupations at Smith Creek Cave lack subalpine conifers, suggesting that these occupations
postdate 11,000 BP. Woodland plants are rare in late Pleistocene plant assemblages from the
Great Basin. Utah juniper migrated into the region in the early Holocene, several millenia prior to
the arrival of single-needile pinyon pine. This pinyon, an important aboriginal resource, apparently
did not reach the east central Great Basin until roughly 6000 BP. (19)

discussed include (1) the scheduling of procurement, manufacture and maintenance activities
and (2) the structure of tool kits. In particular, predictions for assemblage structure are made in

saw significant changes in human postcranial anatomy associated with the evolution of
Neanderthals into anatomically modern humans. These postcranial alterations included a
decrease in robustness, changes in thumb phalanx proportions and a reduction of pelvic aperture
size. All of these anatomical changes correlate with the contemporaneous cultural changes of
the Middle to Upper Paleolithic transition, but the patterns of feedback between the anatomy and
cultural behaviors of these humans varied depending upon the functional complex involved. (6)

IN MORTUARY RITUAL. Patterning of mortuary ritual has been shown to contain information

but can be supplemented by written sources describing nonmaterial aspects of ritual. However,
study of Central Asian/iranian ossuary burial in the early first millenium AD demonstrates con-
tradictions between archaeological and documentary sources, since the documents are artifacts
of a political process which altered the role of mortuary ritual. Both codification of mortuary ritual
and the range of variation of mortuary forms reflect structural changes in the societies of which
they were part. (9)

agriculture has been advanced by numerous interdisciplinary studies during the past decade.
These studies indicate some of the major agrotechnologies, forms of cultivation and economic
species used by the ancient Maya and suggest the broader sequences of agricultural change that
took place in the region. The evidence seems to indicate a change from dryland systems of exten-
sive (input-output) cultivation to wetland systems of intensive cultivation. By Classic times,
northern Belize maintained one of the largest documented networks of wetland cultivation in
Mesoamerica. Throughout the entire agricultural sequence orchard-garden type species were
apparently important. (3)

technomorphological and functional analyses of lithic artifacts from Meadowcroft Rockshelter
(36WH297) and the Cross Creek drainage, chert raw material sources have been studied. To date,
five major chert sources have been identified via petrographic thin sectioning and analysis. X-ray
diffraction also has been used to determine the presence/absence of calcite and dolomite in
these specimens. Cross comparisons of lithic artifacts and raw materials from the entire Cross
Creek drainage are drawn to well dated lithics recovered from Meadowcroft Rockshelter itself
« which has provided an indispensable temporal “yardstick” for these lithological studies.
Knowledge thus gained is crucial to an understanding of prehistoric trade and/or exchange and

Villa, Paola (Wyoming) GEOGRAPHIC VARIABILITY AND RAW MATERIALS IN THE ACHEULIAN
OF WESTERN EUROPE, The existence of separate cultural provinces in the European Acheulian
is a traditional notion held by some archaeologists but denied by others. This notion is based on
unsystematic observations of differences in tool forms and technical features in assemblages
from different regions. Total assemblage content and variation within the same region are not
part of the argument; thus the “functional” explanation need not be directly involved. A
systematic study of the archaeological materials on which these high level interpretations are
based shows that the link between evidence and proposed inference is very weak. The pattern of
variation is strongly dependent on the use of different raw materials and it appears to reflect not
cultural variability but differences in the availability and physical properties of raw materials. (9)

by actually reconstructing cores. The reconstructions delimit the exact technological ap-

ploitation through time and the ways In which individuals and societies relate to each other
through the materials they manipulate. Intensification of the exploitation of a nonsubsistence or
nonfood resource such as stone plays an important part in the development of socioeconomic
systems and thus needs to be studied by the archaeologist. In this study, special attention is
given to developments in the patterns of distribution and consumption which directly pertain to
the relations between producing and consuming units. Resultant theories are tested with recent
data on stone exploitation during the Neolithic in Southeast Europe. (49)

ments, which are construction oriented and are bound by engineering constraints, this is often
not possible. An alternative approach, partial preservation coupled with data recovery in site
areas to be disturbed, has been successfully employed in Illinois. Several specific examples are
discussed and evaluated. (14)

use of biotopes. Estuarine and marine faunal remains recovered from sites indicate not only the
anticipated inter-island variability but also intra-island variability. The significance of marine
resource utilization by prehistoric Antiieans seems to be site-specific. (10)

Webster, David and Gary Webster (Penn. State) OPTIMAL FORAGING AND PLEISTOCENE Ex-
TINCTION. A basic assumption of the Pleistocene extinction, or “overkill” hypothesis, is that
rates of human predation on numerous genera of megafauna exceeded prey replacement rates.
Previous assessments of this hypothesis have often stressed the technological or organizational
capabilities of Paleolithic hunters to harvest prey in sufficient numbers to threaten extinction.
Optimal foraging models and ethnographic observations of modern hunters-gatherers provide a
logical basis for assessing the feasibility of alternative reconstructions of Paleolithic hunting
strategies as well as thelr compatibility with the concept of critically high rates of predation suffi-
cient to cause extinction. (19)

Wendorf, Fred (Southern Methodist) LATE PALEOLITHIC FOOD PRODUCTION ALONG THE
EGYPTIAN NILE. This paper discusses the Late Paleolithic sites where numerous grains of
barley, wheat, lentils, chickpeas and dates were found associated with charcoal dating between
18,300 and 17,000 BP. These discoveries have profound implication for our understanding of the
processes which led to the beginning of food production. It is no longer feasible to view the begin-
ning of food production as a response to environmental stress or as a result of demographic
pressure. (18)

Whalen, Michael F. (Tulsa) SETTLEMENT SYSTEM EVOLUTION IN THE QUEMADO AREA OF
WEST CENTRAL NEW MEXICO. Survey data are used to characterize Pithouse and Pueblo period
adaptations to the study area. Changes in these adaptive strategies are traced between the two
periods (ca. AD 400-1350). Pithouse adaptations involve small, dispersed settlements scattered
over a number of environmental zones. Early Pueblo settlement systems continue to be small and
dispersed, although they are very specific in location near arable land. Later Pueblo settlement
systems are based on large nucleated villages located exclusively in optimum farming areas of
major drainages. It is argued that this nucleation represents a shift into a different mode of opera-
tion and production in order to deal with the pressures generated by population growth. (25)
Whalley, Lucy A. (IIlinois) DIVERSITY IN LATE BLUFF/MISSISSIPPIAN PLANT EXPLOITATION IN
THE AMERICAN BOTTOM OF ILLINOIS. Mississippian subsistence throughout the Midwest has
traditionally been assumed to have been dominated by maize agriculture. This may in fact be the
case, although convincing evidence has yet to be produced. Recent data from 14 Late
Bluff/Mississippian components in the American Bottom of Illinois suggest that a recurring com-
plex of domesticated, cultivated and wild plants was utilized In addition to maize. This type of
adaptation develops in terminal Late Woodland times in both the adjacent uplands of the
American Bottom and on the floodplain proper. This pattern will be examined in view of current
models describing the Mississippian subsistence adaptation. (39)

Purdue (Illinois State Museum) THE EVOLUTION OF FAUNAL EXPLOITATION STRATEGIES: A
CASE STUDY IN THE LOWER ILLINOIS VALLEY. Studies of prehistoric human faunal exploita-
tion over the past 20 years in the lower lilinois Valley and surrounding Midwestern regions docu-
ment three major changes in subsistence strategies. The first change occurs at the Paleoindian
to Archaic transition and includes loss of Pleistocene megafauna and minor losses of more
northern boreal elements. The second major trend involves mammal utilization during Archaic
times and is marked by initial diverse usage of small-bodied animals in conjunction with white-
tailed deer eventually leading to more selective utilization of larger-bodied mammals. The third
major shift occurs around 7500-7000 BP when there is an explosion in aquatic exploitation at
sites in major river valleys. Stimuli important to these changes vary through time but include
changing climate and landscapes, developing technologies and procurement efficiency, evolving
social organization, growing human populations and changing demography. (1)
Wheeler, Jane (Peabody Foundation) LAMOID DOMESTICATION AND THE EARLY DEVELOP.
MENT OF PASTORALISM IN THE CENTRAL PERUVIAN ANDES. Archaeozoological analysis of
approximately 200,000 animal bones from Telarmarchay Rockshelter has produced evidence of jn
situ lamoid domestication and the development of llama and alpaca pastoralism by 4300 BC
calibrated, or 5400 + 60 BP radiocarbon years in the Puna of Junin, Peru. Comparison of the Telar-
machay faunal data with that from the nearby sites of Uchcumachay, Pachamachay and
Panaulauca points to the establishment of a seasonal herding round by this date. The relative im-
portance of lamoid hunting and herding at these sites, and in the evolution of early human adap-
tation to the Andean highlands, is discussed. (46)

in sediment that accumulated rapidly near the end of the Pleistocene. Vegetation kinds changed
and soil, formed on steep badiand slopes during the late Wisconsin glaciation, eroded and was
deposited in the valley with the site. Black 1- to 3-mm diameter organic masses occurred in the
light colored sediment associated with and capping the bones. Aggradation was rapid or the
sediment would be uniformly darkened. The mottled sediment was capped by several thin CaCO,

A TOPOGRAPHIC APPROACH. Based on the topographic study of 185 sites in the Perigord

lined. It is argued that the traditional nondiscovery of kill sites is, in fact, nonrecognition. Where
available, supporting faunal and assemblage data are presented. Future research designs are

Reconstruction of geomorphic environments in space and time in the American Bottom of the
middie Mississippi River Valley aid archaeological interpretation of twelve prehistoric sites.
These sites are associated with paleo-river channels as well as an alluvial fan and provide data on
the association of geomorphic environments across a range of cultural affiliations. Analysis of
Holocene fluvial development in this portion of the American Bottom demonstrates the dynamic
nature and variability of stream processes in a relatively small area and plays 4 significant role in
explaining the pattern of archaeological sites. (11)
Whittaker, John C. (Arizona) SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS OF PROJECTILE POINT VARIATION. a
large collection of projectile points from the Grasshopper Ruin in east central Arizona is analyzed.
The use of sets of points from the limited context of single burials allows some tests for variation
due to the idiosyncracies of individual knappers. Where individual craftsmen can be identified,
some conclusions about social order can be advanced. (49)
Whitten, Richard G. (South Dakota) NATURE AND FUNCTION OF CERTAIN RAISED FIELDS,
GUAYAS BASIN, ECUADOR. Excavations of selected relict raised fields near Samborondon,
Guayas Basin, Ecuador are summarized. Evidence for human creation and utilization of these
small mounds is presented. Carbon dating of samples taken from mounds suggests major oc-
cupation and use of mounds in the 7th century AD. Material culture, although badly preserved, is
related to local “Milagro” culture. From frequency of ceramic graters, it is suggested that root
crops, particularly manioc, was of great importance in raised field farming. The paper examines
the nature of these raised fields and suggests avenues for future research based upon these
preliminary results. (30)

AND MOBILITY: ARCHAIC RESOURCE SELECTION. This paper provides a model of lithic pro-
curement strategy which is applied to Archaic period sites in Illinois. The abundance of lithic
resources, resource quality, tool technology and group mobility are integrated into a mode! which
is used to evaluate similarities and differences in chert tool and debris from Middle to Late Ar-
chaic period occupations in the Lower illinois River valley. Of specific interest is whether or not
there are differences in the quality of chert used for tool production as territory size or group
mobility decreases in an environment where chert resources are generally available. Another not
qualitatively equivalent consideration undertaken here is whether or not procurement and tool
production strategies differ in areas where chert resources are scarce. The multicomponent
Napoleon Hollow site is used as a basis for development of this model. (1)

Wilk, Richard R. (UC-Santa Cruz) LITTLE HOUSE IN THE JUNGLE, THE CAUSES OF VARIATION
IN HOUSE SIZE AMONG MODERN MAYA. Archaeologists frequently relate differences in house
size within prehistoric communities to variation in status or family size. This ethnoarchaeological
study of modern Kekchi Maya houses relates the area of houses to a large number of social and
economic variables, and concludes that no single variable can account for a large part of the dif-
ference. Rather than letting the lesson rest as a cautionary tale, the paper proposes that the lack
of simple correlations is a key to the essential nature of social/artifactual interactions in
egalitarian communities. (12)

REINVESTIGATED. At the request of the BLM, the Museum of Anthropology is excavating and
reanalyzing this famous early agricultural shelter in south central New Mexico. Although the
deposits have been vandalized, an extensive paleoenvironmental horizon underlies the remnant
cultural levels. Late Pleistocene beach gravels are covered by these stratified layers that are not
continuous throughout the site. A primitive though not early maize is present and perishable ar-
tifacts are abundant. The cultural midden is distinctly stratified but most of it consists of in-
terbedded pack rat nests. It is possible to correlate our excavations with previously published
reports but numerous carbon-14 dates are required to interface the various cultural levels. New
dates for corn and squash are presented. (25)

Windes, Thomas C. (Chaco Center) A SECOND LOOK AT POPULATION IN CHACO CANYON. A
number of recent models dealing with the Chacoan phenomena presume a large permanent
population residing in the canyon during the Classic Bonito Phase (AD 1020-1120) despite the
growing evidence that local resources were inadequate to support such a population. Now there
are data to suggest that town population was lower than previously envisioned, but perhaps
periodically boostered by seasonal influxes of people. Furthermore, | now believe that the small
site population was much less than in the preceding period. Thus, a more critical look at the tim-
ing of the population fluctuations in Chaco Canyon is necessary for a further understanding of the
entire Chacoan system. (25)

Wiseman, Frederick M. (Louisiana State) PHYTOLITH EVIDENCE FOR SWIDDEN-LIKE
AGRICULTURE IN THE MAYA LOWLANDS. Soil samples from the forests of the Maya Lowlands
contain abundant and well preserved grammoid phytoliths, indicating the presence of grass in
areas now covered with tropical forest. The presence of maize-like phytoliths within this
assemblage implies swidden in the uplands at some time in the past. Analysis of sealed soils
dating before the Middle Preciassic Period also contain maize and other grass phytoliths. The im-
plications of these data to theories of the development and complexity of Maya agriculture are
manifold. Swidden was probably an early and necessary stage in the sequence of agricultural in-
tensification in the Maya area. (51)

Wobst, H. Martin and Arthur S. Keene (Massachusetts) ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXPLANATION AS
POLITICAL ECONOMY. Archaeology is not a closed system and archaeologists cannot be ex-
pected to jump over their own shadows. In fact, our science has always been a rather active par-
ticipant in the political economy of the capitalist system. One cannot even begin to understand
certain aspects of the behavior of archaeologists without reference to this system. The interplay
between archaeologists and the capitalist system can be illustrated best with the example of two
archaeological preoccupations—origins research and regional typology. Neither behavior is very
rewarding processually, but both can be seen to gain their preeminence from an external
logic—their exquisite fit within the constraints and rewards of the political economy in which the
discipline is embedded. (31)

Wright, Henry T. (Michigan) PEER POLITY INTERACTION IN EARLY MESOPOTAMIA. The tradi-
tional phrasing of the question of the origin of the state directs attention to political processes
operating in one society leading to the emergence of one state. Recent work, however, has em-
phasized that states rarely, if ever, emerge singly. Instead, a network of interacting polities
develop at more or less the same time. This particular kind of peer policy interaction is not merely
a categorization of the evidence designed to make our efforts at explanation more difficult;
rather, it may be critical to the explanation of the origins of states. In this paper, some of the com-
plexities of this kind of interaction are discussed, then the concepts introduced are illustrated
with evidence from later Mesopotamian history. Finally, the meager evidence is considered of
what is believed to be the key period, the Early Uruk Period, for the development of states in early
Mesopotamia in terms of this conceptualization. (36)

ECUADOR. Valdivia, the oldest pottery making culture of coastal Ecuador, dates between 3000

cent and ongoing excavations at San Isidro, a large multicomponent site north of Bahia on the
north coast of Manabi, reveal a large Valdivia ceremonial center containing elaborate ceramics,
Spondylus “plaques,” and other items of a complex culture. Comparisons between this rich
northern Valdivia and the relatively simple Valdivia sites known from the south affords an instruc-

and “comparability,” while dividing survey goals into two mutually exclusive groups—"'reality
reflectors” and “individual goal fulfillers.” Finally, methodological limitations created by types of
archaeological variables and by observational spacing are discussed, (40)
