Bluff Shelter Excavations in Northern Alabama
During the past three years the University of Alabama
has cooperated with the Alabama Archaeological Society
and the Archaeological Research Association of Ala-
bama, Inc. in the survey and excavation of rock shel-
ters along the rim of the Tennessee Valley in north-
erm Alabama. The first of these, the Stanfield-
Worley Shelter, was excavated in 1961 and reported on
in the Journal of Alabama Archaeology, Volume VIII,
Nos. 1 and 2, 1962. A second season at this shelter
was completed in 1964 during which a closer tie be-
tween projectile point styles and known pottery se-
quences was attempted. The second of the bluff shel-
ters, Asbury Rock House, located in Marshall County,
was excavated during 1962 and 1963. This site rep-
resents the first well documented report for the
stratigraphic placement of the Cumberland point. Four
fragments with well defined flutes have been tenta-
tively identified as Cumberland. Although natural
stratigraphy could not be discerned in the excava-
tions, the fragments were found in the deepest levels
(32 to 44 inches). Present also in these levels were
two Quads, three Daltons, uniface tools, and several
projectile points considered to be Early Archaic.

Geology of Indian Head Cave, Birch Creek Valley,

Idaho
This cave, at the head of the bahada in the upper part
of broad Birch Oreek Valley, is in fractured, folded
limestone of the Beaverhead Mountains. Its height
averages 7 feet; its floor, about 353 feet square, rises
gently imward. Before excavation by Hind Sadek in
1961-62, a fill of angular limestone rubble and tens
of thousands of unburned bone fragments sealed off
the cave at the front and nearly filled the rear.
Protruding joint blocks covered by fill are smooth
and sharply angular; those above the fill have rounded
edges and surfaces roughened by secondary calcium
Carbonate precipitated from moisture clinging to ex-
posed rock surfaces after the fill accumulated and
, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS 17
sealed the cave. This water, not present when the
cave Was opened, apparently collected during a pluvial
episode. It is estimated that the cool, moist Medi-

; thermal interval lasted from 2000 to 500 B.P. in this
arid part of Idaho, a period perhaps too recent, too
brief, and of insufficient intensity to permit solu-
tion of joint-block edges to the extent observed.

4 Previously, sufficient moisture would have been pres-
ent during the Lateglacial and Early Postglacial
(Anathermal) periods ending about 9500 B.P. To allow
time for solutional activity in the restricted micro-
Climate, the cave must have been sealed two or more
millenia earlier. This reasoning suggests that a
radiocarbon date of 10,000 B.P. for charcoal near the
middie of the fill section is too young, an inference
supported by the suite of extinct mammals and birds
represented by bones throughout the fill.

Some Implications for Archaeology of Eskaleut
Linguistic Classifications
The distributions of Eskaleut and of languages and
dialects of its Eskimoan division are considered to-
gether with relative time-depths implied by the lin-
guistic classification. Some archaeological hori-
zons from the area of present Eskimo speech are ex-
amined, and an attempt is made to tentatively identi-
fy archaeological manifestations of social groups
ancestral to speakers of modern Inupik, Yupik, Eski-
moan, and Eskaleut.

A Long Stratified Sequence from Nuevo Leon,

Mexico
During the period between October 1 and December 15th,

1965, excavations were carried out in a rock shelter
approximately 50 kilometers west of Linares, Nuevo
Leon, Mexico. Because the deposit was only five feet
thick and showed no natural zoning, and because the
artifact density was especially high, the main ex-
Cavation block was dug in artificial levels of 3

inches. The deposit contained what appears to be an
unbroken series of occupations from terminal Pleisto-
cene times to the 16th century. Although the projec-
tile point sequence obtained largely duplicates that
worked out by MacNeish for Tamaulipas, the remainder
of the chipped stone assemblage is quite different.

A Feldspar Inlaid Ceramic Type from Spanish

Colonial Sites
A type of Mesoamerican pottery of general earthenware
characteristics has been known &s part of the village
pottery complex of modern Mesoamerica. The earthen-
ware is characterized by inlays of small tessera of
white feldspar. Additional decoration may involve
rouletting, stamping, and modeling. Shapes involve
plates, pitchers, and urn forms. The same ware is
now known to have been made at a Spanish colonial kiln
in Panama Vieja, Republic of Panama where sherds were
found in close association with the kiln. These
sherds are believed to date from the 17th century.
Highly similar sherds have been observed at the site
of Ft. Jesus, Mombasa where they are presumed to re-
late to the Portugese occupation. Additional infor-
mation is needed on the distribution of this distinc-
tive type.

Two Manitoba Burial Mounds
The excavation of two burial mounds along the Red
River at Lockport, Manitoba was carried out during
the summer of 1963 as part of a larger salvage archae-
ological project. Both mounds produced considerable
material in spite of previous disturbances from ex-
Cavators. The undisturbed burials recovered show
different burial modes, some evidences of skeletal
pathology, and a certain variety of associated arti-
facts. Cultural material from the mound fill indi-
Cates the presence of a habitation site adjacent to

The Younge Tradition: <A Late Woodland Sequence
; in Southeastern Michigan
A distinctive Late Woodland cultural tradition was
identified in southeastern Michigan at the Younge
site, excavated and reported by Dr. Emerson F. Green-
man in 1957. Recent analysis of materials from the
Riviere au Vase, Puller and Verchave sites in Macomb
County, Michigan and the Fort Wayne Mound in Wayne
County, Michigan have demonstrated a developmental se-
quence within this tradition. Four successive phases
of the Younge Tradition have been isolated in the time
period between approximately A.D. 800 and A.D. 1500.

The Archaic Cultures of the Midwest
The area discussed centers around the middle Missis-
Sippi River Valley and the various tributaries. The
cultural materials which underlay Archaic in the Mid-
west are Clovis. There are no data to present, with
the possible exception of Graham Cave that shows
Archaic developing out of Clovis. Archaic cultures
are clearly established by 7000 B.C. and, therefore,
are contemporary with Folsom in the southern Plains,
Plainview in the northern Plains, and Plano in the
Prairie. Archaic materials are associated with
Plano-like points in the Midwest, namely Dalton in
southern Illinois and Plano or Plainview like in cen-
tral Illinois. These are part of the Archaic assem-
blage but may represent technological carry-overs of
the Clovis tradition. The development of the Archaic
in the Midwest is one of gradual ecological adapta-
tion to specific environmental zones. The seasonal
] cycle of food getting was developed and well estab-
lished by the Archaic peoples. Late in Archaic se-
quences there is evidence that the cultivation of lo-
Cal plants, such as the sunflower, augmented the sub-
Sistence base. Several regional traditions or cul-
tures are recognizable in the Archaic of the Midwest.
, 20 TWENTY-NINTH ANNUAL MEETING
This is probably a direct reflection of the localized
food getting techniques and the seasonal cycle which
localized the territoriality of the Archaic peoples
and limited the contacts they had with other groups.
The Archaic of the Midwest is the basic cultural ex-
pression upon which the elaborate ceremonial complex
of the tomb builder cult was added.

Eskimo-Indian Contacts in 30-Layer Stratigraphy
The spacious Onion Portage site on the forested Kobuk
River in Arctic Alaska has, in sharply defined strati-
graphy, a long series of cultural phases, alternating
at irregular intervals between Eskimo-related coastal
forms and more Indian-like, as yet unnamed, forms, not
yet found on the coast. From the top, the better-
known Coastal phases represented here are Tigara (or
Kotzebue), Thule, Norton, and Denbigh Flint. The
Denbigh layer may represent the earliest of Eskimo-
like cultures in America. Below it are at least fif-
teen culture layers, some containing notched points,
but none containing microblades or burins. Still
deeper levels are not yet fully explored. They appear
to reach back into glacial times.

Beach Ridge Archaeology and Vertical Stratigraphy
in Alaska (50 min. film, 16 mm., color, silent)
Several beach ridge series, where sites occur in time
order, are shown from the air and on the ground,
spaced around 250 miles of the Chukchi Sea from Bering
Strait to Cape Krusenstern. Sites and excavations are
shown of these cultural phases: Recent, Old Kotzebue,

approached, first by boat and then by climbing, and
the elevated site itself is examined; camp life and
the arrival of a reindeer herd are examined; a burned

‘ ipiutak house divulges skeletons; and the Battle Rock
Site is visited. Finally, the film moves inland to
the forested Kobuk River, where, on a high terrace,
are found notched points and microblades and then
farther up river to the Onion Portage site where in
some thirty layers, shown in detail, Denbigh flints
occur halfway down, with a wide range of notched-
point layers below that, and, lower still, what ap-

The Culture and Ecology of a Prehistoric Hunting

and Gathering Group in the Upper Great Lakes
The Juntunen Site is located on the western tip of
Bois Blanc Island which is in Lake Huron on the east
Side of the Straits of Mackinac. The field and labo-
ratory methods used in the study of the geology of
the site were a compromise between small-scale archae-
ological techniques and large scale geological tech
niques. A research design, constructed to avoid the
problems of this compromise, will be discussed.
The morphology of the site during each occupation, the
vegetation cover during each occupation, and the pro-
cesses responsible for these features (specifically
the regressions and transgressions of Lake Huron) have
been reconstructed. The phenomena will be discussed
in relation to cultural developments on the site.
The analysis of the animal remains represents the only
intensive quantitative and qualitative analyses of the
food remains from an aboriginal fishing site in the
Great Lakes area. The Juntunen site represents recur-
rent spring to late fall occupations of people who
were participating in a subsistence cycle which has
been called the "Inland Shore Fishing Complex." The
important food items during this season were fish,
especially whitefish and large sturgeon, which were
taken with harpoons and perhaps gill nets.
The ecological position of the Juntunen site between
two major natural provinces is of particular interest
in view of the fact that climatic fluctuations should
be reflected in the fauna of the site. The fauna of
the earliest major occupation (835 A.D.) and that of
the latest occupation (1200-1300 A.D.), shows strong
affinities with the boreal forest to the north while
the middle occupation (900-1000 A.D.) contains spe-
cies typically associated with the deciduous forest
farther south.

u
, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS 25
The identifiable plant remains from the site include
corn, a variety of cherry pits, chenopod seeds, black-
berry, raspberry, blueberry, grape, elderberry, beech-

; nut, acorns, Canada plum, sumac, and pepper-root
tubers. The plant remains correspond to a period of
occupation of the site from May to October. The
maize is probably an early variety of the Eastern

é Complex. The earliest appearance of maize at the site
is about A.D. 1000 and this is one of the most north-
ern archaeological examples of maize.

The earliest occupation shows similarities to other
Middle Woodland groups from the Sauge@én focus of On-
tario to the North Bay I complex on the Door Penin-
sula of Wisconsin, to Laurel in Minnesota and Ontario
and to Point Peninsula to the east. There are ap-
parently a series of occupations during Middle Wood-
land times. They represent some of the first evi-
dences we have for the intensive utilization of aquat-
ic resources in the Upper Great Lakes. A radiocarbon
date from a grave containing several flexed burials
and pottery, places one of the Middle Woodland occu-
pations at A.D. 63%+130 (M-13592).
The major part of the site is Late Woodland and has a
stone industry that is characterized by heavy reli-
ance on non-local cherts. Besides small triangular
points, often produced from free flakes solely by edge
trimming and thumbnail scrapers, a “small-tool con-
plex" is attested, particularly for the later occupa-
tions, with a distinctive technique for production of
artifacts, mostly previously umreported, but also in-
Cluding classic bladelets. Groundstone tools are
virtually absent.
Copper artifacts made at the site consist largely of
small awls. Artifacts and copper debris indicate raw
materials to have been obtained in form of small dis-
crete pieces, suggesting perhaps a change in source of
supply from that of the "Old Copper" industry. Copper
is absent from the earliest occupations and is heavi-
est in the later ones.

i Ceramics range from Lake Michigan Ware corded and
punctated vessels in early periods, with stylistic
Similarities closest to Wisconsin, through Iroquois-
like collared, castellated, push-pull decorated ves-
sels in latest occupations, indicating a west to east
shift in style-area affiliations.
, 24 TWENTY-NINTH ANNUAL MEETING
Settlement and community patterns: a long-house was
built during a late occupation period. Settlement
cycle is inferred to be essentially that known for the
historic Ojibwa. Physically the population is close
to that of the historical Algonkins of the area.
The site is also of importance because it is on the
border of several biotic and geographic zones, and is
sensitive to changes of minor nature in exploitative
and economic systems. It is located at a strategic
point between the Michigan and Huron basins and be-
tween the upper and lower peninsulas of Michigan.

The New Two-Creeks Radiocarbon Dates and Their

Archaeological Implications
The new Two-Creeks Radiocarbon dates are about 1000
years earlier than that of many interpretations of
their age. They are in phase with new estimates of
the age of the Champlain Sea, of the initial stage of
James Bay and demand a new estimate of the age of the
Cochrane. The correlation of projectile point styles
with Great Lakes geochronology suggests that the
shift from fluted points to Plano forms took place
earlier in the Great Lakes than in the High Plains.

The Archaic Sequence in the Ocmulgee Bottoms
Salvage excavations conducted in the bottomlands of
Ocmulgee National Monument, Georgia, in advance of
construction of an Interstate Highway, disclosed a
projectile point sequence ranging from Early Archaic
to Savannah River, as well as all later and previous-
ly known periods. The sequence is associated with
stratigraphically defined soil zones established by
geologists working on the project, and correlates well
with the dated sequences in the nearby states of North
Carolina and Alabama. The occupation of Ocmulgee, as
now known, stretches virtually uninterrupted from
Paleo-Indian through Historic Creek times.

Sequence of Pottery Types in Some of the Lesser
Antilles
| Pottery types are demonstrably useful archaeological
tools in the Lesser Antilles. The sequence of types
| established in select excavations in St. Lucia and in
Martinique confirms the sequence in Trinidad and north-
erm South America. Several horizon markers are so uni-
form throughout their distribution from St. Iwcia to
Guadeloupe as to suggest their being trade objects.
These are the early "types" such as White on Red,
Broad-Line Incised, Incised Polychrome, and Zoned
Crosshatch. An additional type may be delineated
based on conventionalized faces with coffee bean eyes.
Another is a distinctive rim treatment wherein the lip
area is regularly punctated with finger depressions.
The seriation of these uniform and easily recognized
types enables the reconstruction of a site occupation
sequence applicable to all the Lesser Antilles.

An Apparent Symmetry in Pre-Neolithic Develop-
ments: Western Europe and Eastern United States
Recent work in Europe and the eastern United States
has so altered pre-Neolithic chronologies as to indi-
cate the possibility of several interesting correla-
tions. Late Pleistocene hunting in both regions gave
way to early Holocene hunting-fishing-foraging at ap-
proximately the same time. It is suggested that this
transformation was in both instances largely ecologi-
cal in nature. Whereas previously ways of life could
be largely geared to animals of a few species, with
post-glacial environmental succession it became nec-
, essary to diversify. Thus, similar environmental
] Changes of late Pleistocene-Early Recent on both sub-
continents appear to have induced broadly similar

Jamaican Archaeology
Recent investigations still yield no sign of pre-
pottery or of Arawak occupation of Jamaica before
early Period III in the Rouse chronology. Jamaican
Sites indicate a characteristically Arawakan culture
lacking, however, the ceremonial elaboration devel-
oped in Haiti. Jamaican pottery shows relatively lit-
tle change through time and only minor local varia-
tion. Two distinct sub-types are present: (1) Little
River from early Period III and (2) Montego Bay whose
position in time is still not clear. Closest sty-
listic affiliation is with Bani of Cuba and Meillac
of Haiti. The late period Carrier style of Haiti did
not diffuse to Jamaica. Certain distinctive burial
practices and features of village construction are
evidenced by recent excavations at White Marl and other
south coast sites.

Cultural Relationships between Lagoa Santa and
the Sambaquis of Southern Brazil
A comparison of the artifacts from the oldest con-
plexes of the caves of Lagoa Santa in south central
Brazil with those from the Sambaquis (shell-mounds) of
the coast of Parana reveals many typological similari- |
ties. Because all the known evidence points to great-
er age of oldest artifacts from Lagoa Santa, approxi-
mately 10,000 years ago, it is possible that they are
the ancestral forms of those that appeared in the
shellmounds, the earliest of which has been dated at
7000 years ago. Apparently what occurred is that
hunting peoples in the interior gradually moved down
to the coast during the onset of the Post-glacial
thermal maximum to take advantage of a postulated in-
crease in shellfish. Judging by the type of artifacts
these latter shellfish collectors never gave up conm-
pletely their hunting activities. In fact they may

have remained on the coast only for a certain season
of the year and at other times returned to the high-
lands for hunting. Major artifact types in common
included stemmed projectile points made of stone,

and polished axes and celts, pitted hammerstones, and

The Standing Boy Flint Industry: An Early Archaic

Manifestation on the Chattahoochee River in Ala-

bama and Georgia
Edward V. McMichael and James H, Kellar (1959 Archae-
ological Salvage in the Oliver Basin) described the
Standing Boy Flint Industry, an Early Archaic artifact
assemblage from a site above Columbus, Georgia, includ-
ing plano-convex knives, scrapers and flake scrapers,
and small triangular alternate-bevel points ("spin-
ners"). Artifacts characteristically are made of a
flint now leached to a completely chalky form, as
originally described by A. R. Kelly from the Macon
Plateau. Additional sites investigated by River Basin
Surveys (1958-1963) along 100 miles of the Chattahoo-
chee River bottoms, confirm the importance of the
Standing Boy complex as a consistent Early Archaic
phenomenon, but gradational stratigraphy obscures ex-
act delimitation of types on present information.
Better separation may depend on sampling restricted
Camps at spring sites higher in the hills.

fined is believed to cover the time period from ca.
7,000 to ca. 2,000 - 1,500 B.C. The character of the ,
remains ranges from materials usually considered in
the Paleo-Indian category to the transition from the
preceramic to the ceramic period. Many preceramic
traits are seen to be antecedent to preclassic and

The Archaeological Discovery of Fort Knox II at
\Vineennes, Indiana
The strategic importance of the Wabash River to the
French, then British and American interests in the
Northwest Territory lead to the early establishment
of a series of forts in the lower valley at the set-
tlement of Vincennes. The earliest American-built ;
fort, completed in 1788, was the first of three posts
named in honor of the then Secretary of War, Henry
Knox. The second Fort Knox dates from sometime after
1803 when the military garrison was transferred to a
site about two miles north of Vincennes only to be
returned to town ten years later under the pressure of
Indian hostilities on the frontier around the time of ;
the Battle of Tippecanoe and the onset of the War of
1812. In July, 1963, the Indiana Historical Society
undertook an exploratory excavation at what was
vaguely indicated by historical documentation to be
the site of Fort Knox II and succeeded in uncovering r

parts of two sides of the stockade and a corner bas-

of the 19th century. A complete excavation is now
planned for what is probably the only surviving major
historic fort in the state.

Speculations on the Origin and Affiliations of

the Cultures of Northwestern Mesoamerica
Knowledge of the culture sequences in Zacatecas -
Durango and Sinaloa on the northwestern frontier of
Mesoamerica has now reached the stage where specula-
tions as to Mesoamerican origins and affiliations of
these cultural sequences may be undertaken with some
confidence. It seems probable that the Canutillo
Culture of Zacatecas-Durango derives from a Pre-
Classic source and was dominant as early as A.D. 100;
& similar origin may be postulated for the earliest
Sinaloa cultures. A wave of Teotihuacan III cere-
monialism is believed to have strongly influenced
Zacatecas-Durango developments around A.D. 350; sub-
sequent Post-Classic influences on the north-central
Cultures were slight, but in Sinaloa extremely direct
and strong Post-Classic influences were felt after
about A.D. 1000.

Time-lapse photography, although widely used in the |
biological sciences, has received little attention |
from archaeologists for a number of reasons. One of |
the significant factors in this ommission is the ex- |

timers. Research has resulted in the development of
& timer which is inexpensive, lightweight, and which
can be used to operate any 16 mm. motion picture
Camera (capable of singleframe exposures) for time-
lapse photography. In the field this equipment can be
used to: (1) Record vertical profiles as they are be-
ing exposed, with the expectation that minute differ-
ences in color and/or texture which may not be visi-
ble upon drying are recorded on color film; (2) Pro-
vide a supplemental record during the excavation of |
particular features; (3) Function -as graphic demon-

as compensatory adjustments to a progressive inade- |

stabilize the site as a winter encampment. Other

Microlithofacies Analysis and Archaeological
Stratigraphy
Lithofacies analysis has long been a valid and useful
geological tool used for the reconstruction of past
environments. Similar techniques, on a micro-scale,
could also prove stratigraphically useful in archae-
Ology. The basic concepts of microlithofacies are
defined and methodology is examined in such areas as
Collection, analysis, and interpretation of data,
paleogeographic, -climate, and -ecologic correlation,
~ and general ‘mapping’ techniques. Recent evidence
from the Lucy, New Mexico Early Man Site is utilized
to show the methodology, techniques, and practical
archasological advantages of microlithofacies analy-
sis. Other possible uses are postulated for this
comparatively new stratigraphic method.

| Use of the Mean Location in Summarizing the Geo-

| When sites and artifacts are abundant, and distribu-

mechanical difficulties arise in objectively deriving
inferences from distribution patterns and in demon-
strating to others the empirical bases for such in-
ferences. Use of the mean location or "center of |
gravity" allows the distribution of each artifact
| Class to be plotted as a single point on amap, thus |
facilitating direct comparison of numerous dis*ribu- |
tions. Electronic computation minimizes the labor
involved in calculating the mean locations. Results

Role of the Incense-Burner Stand at Izapa During
. Its 2,000 Year Evolution
The incense-burner stand or incensario base appeared
at Izapa during the Middle Preclassic era and contin-
ued through the Protoclassic as a basin-topped cylin-
der sometimes with three horns. It seems unaccompanied
by other ceremonial paraphernalia and to have served
@ unique function; carved scenes on stone monuments
illustrate this role. In the Early Classic period
the burner stand was greatly proliferated and during
the Late Classic both three-horn burner stands and
effigy incensarios were a constant part of abundant
ceremonial refuse at Izapa, apparently associated with
elaborate rituals dedicated to the older Izapan water
and forest dieties.

Earliest Aleutian Prehistory: The Anangula
Island Core and Blade Site
Pronounced Asiatic similarities and an early date in
excess of 8,000 years ago characterize the large core
and blade site on Anangula Island. Radiocarbon dates
and geologic analysis indicate that this marine based
site, representing a single archaeological horizon,
was occupied when Anangula was a part of Umnak Island
and that it was terminated by volcanic ashfall. The
artifact inventory of over 6,000 specimens includes
micro-through macro-blades and polyhedral cores, core
tablets, burins and spalls, unifacial knives, scrap-
ers and graving tools, grinding stones, abraders, and
stone vessel fragments. An extensive living floor
and a pit dwelling with charcoal hearths have been
exposed. We suggest that the inhabitants moved here
from the Bering platform while much of the Alaska
Peninsula remained under ice.

The Excavation of the Murad Mound, Kanawha
County, West Virginia
In the fall of 1962 and spring of 1963, the West
Virginia Geological Survey excavated the Murad Mound,
east of St. Albans, West Virginia. Two log tombs
were uncovered, each containing one skeleton with two
Copper bracelets. The only other artifacts were in
the fill dirt and consisted of clay-tempered pottery,
corner-notched, side-notched, and stemmed projectile
points, hematite celt fragments, and a number of
scraper types. It is assumed that most of these
artifacts pertain to the builders of the mound. The
mound apparently was constructed by mixed Adena-
Armstrong Hopewell peoples and probably dates between
500 to 1 B.C. Other mound evidence in the Kanawha
Valley is reviewed and it is seen that Adena is very
weakly represented in undiluted form, and that most
of the Charleston area mound and earthwork group is
like the Murad Mound, a result of mixed Adena and
Hopewell.

| A Woodland Camp and Burial Mound Complex in

| Dewey County, South Dakota

Between 1960 and 1963 the Smithsonian Institution has
excavated five burial mounds and portions of a camp-

site along the right bank of the Missouri River in the

| Oahe Reservoir sarea of north central South Dakota.

| The dome-shaped earthen tumuli, two at the Swift Bird
and four at the Grover Hand Site, average 50 feet in
diameter and 2 feet in maximum apical height. The
burial complex includes a subfloor, central burial pit
containing secondary human interments associated with
pottery, stone implements, bone fleshers, bone and
shell ornaments, worked human and animal jaws and
teeth, antler objects, boatstones, hide basketry in-
pressions, matting, and pigments. Logs supported some
type of pit covering. Bison skeletons, scattered mam~
mal bone, primary and secondary human interments are
located on the mound floor. Acceptable radiocarbon
dates for this burial complex range from 101 A.D. to
622 A.D. The campsite extends for 3/4 of a mile along
the edge of the riverbank. The occupation level is
Characterized by scattered middens comprising bison,
bone, small amounts of pottery, stone projectile
points, end scrapers, knives, grooved mauls, and bone
fleshers. Bison long bones stuck vertically into the
ground present an interpretive problem.

The Southeastern Ceremonial Complex, also variously

occurrence in hieroglyphic texts, on pottery and in
religious art and sculpture, an explicit meaning can
be assigmed to each. Such analysis sets the symbols
in proper interpretative context in the southeastern

Preliminary Analysis of Hopewell Influence on

Ohio Late Woodland Pottery
A recent preliminary analysis of ceramics from five
Late Woodland sites in central and southwestern Ohio
has revealed two basic pottery types--cord-marked and
plain ware. The greater percentage of the pottery is
grit-tempered with the remainder being shell-tempered.
The rims of these rather large vessels are everted
and are either flat and squared or have added rim
strips. The bases are semi-concoidal. The thin cord-
marked, grit-tempered vessels with flat, squared rims
are similar to the utilitarian ware associated with
the Hopewell horizon. The shell-tempered vessels,
Some decorated with either the curvilinear or angular
guilloche design, appear to be related to Fort
Ancient. The greater percentage of sherds which can
be placed in this latter category was found in Late
Woodland sites in southwestern Ohio, indicating a
late phase of Late Woodland contemporaneous with Fort
Ancient.

The McGraw Site: A Middle Woodland Site Near

Chillicothe, Ross County, Ohio
The McGraw Site, excavated in 1963, is the first
well-documented village site participating in the
Hopewellian Interaction Sphere of Ohio. It proved to
be a single-component midden, less than 100 x 100 feet
in size, representing apparently a farmstead. Similar
farmsteads were located during survey work throughout
, | ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS 37
the Scioto River valley. The midden, located in the
bottom lands of the river, was covered by two sterile

layers of flood deposit which effectively sealed the
cultural horizon from the surface. The extreme sig-
nificance of this site can be summed up as follows:
it is the first settlement in Ohio which has been
excavated. Its interlocking radiocarbon dates demon-
strate a very late time position within the Hope-
wellian Interaction Sphere (middle-late 5th century
A.D.). The site yielded remains of corn clearly as-
sociated with the midden. The artifacts consist of a
wide variety of items, including what used to be
called classic Hopewell pottery (now: Paint Creek
Series). Im addition to a brief description of the
site and its content, this paper will evaluate the
position of the McGraw Site in the temporal and
spatial framework of the Hopewellian Interaction
Sphere.

Recently Defined Late Archaic and Transitional
Cultures in New York
Excavations conducted in part on stratified sites by
the New York State Museum and Science Service since
1960, have resulted in the elucidation of two new
complexes of the Late Archaic stage, both centered in
eastern New York. Designated the River phase and the
Snook Kill phase, they have been radiocarbon dated,
respectively, at 1930 B.c. = 100 years and 1470 B.C.
* 100 years. The terminal Archaic Snook Kill phase
was succeeded by another newly defined culture of the
Transitional stage, the Frost Island Dhase, C-14
dated to 1250 B.C. = 100 years, and known previously
only from surface sites in eastern Pennsylvania and
most of New York State. At the O'Neil site in cen-
tral New York, where this culture was found in 1962,
for the first time in a well stratified, multicom-
ponent, radiocarbon dated sequence ranging from Late
Archaic to Late Woodland, a few sherds of Vinette 1
ware, the earliest known pottery type in the North-
east, occurred in association with steatite vessel
fragments in the upper level of the Frost Island
stratum, strengthening our previous evidence dating

<% Summary of Venezuelan Archaeology
The ceramic periods of Venezuela began in 1050 B.C.
with bichrome pottery in the Orinoco region. Here
ceramic cultures manifested themselves through the
Saladero, Barrancas, Los Barrancos, and Arauquin
Phases with El Mayal on the northeast coast. In the
west, the ceramic epoch, began with the bichrome and :
polychrome ceramics of the Tocuyano Phase, and lasted
until historical times through the Betijoque, La Pitia,
Guadalupe, and Dabajuro Phases. Between 1150 and 1500
A.D., maize characterized by small cobs, was culti-
vated. Contemporaneously, plastic decoration flour-
ished on the central coast. El Palito, reminiscent of
the Barrancoid tradition, was followed by the Zancudo
and Valencia Phases. Venezuelan prehispanic cultures
are marked by several cultural centers which show the
decisive influence of ecological factors in their de-
velopment.

Certain Environmental Considerations in

West Indian Archaeology
Major migrations into the West Indies emanated out of |
South America. For the most part, Tropical Forest |
traditions were transplanted, but it is obvious that |
these traditions were influenced by a markedly differ- |
ent environment. People who had previously known a ~
river-tropical forest habitat now encountered the sea
with its currents, winds, swells, and expansive trans- |
portation potential. Islands, too, sometimes with
limited fresh water conditions, presented new problems
as well as new opportunities for settlement. Recent
work in the Virgin Islands points to the strong in-
fluence of environment on the settlement patterns of
pre-Columbian peoples. With the advent of extensive
archseological research in the Antillean area, new and
valued interpretations must be sought in the cultural-
environmental complex.

Middle Woodland Culture History in the Southern

Great Lakes-Riverine srea
This paper points up and illustrates a series of dis-
crete, related problems that together may serve as
guide-~lines for the elucidation of Middle Woodland
Culture history in the area of the southern Great
Lakes and the major river valleys immediately to the
South. These problems include: (1) Establishment of
regional style zones (i.e. traditions) within this
geographical area during the Middle Woodland period.
Available evidence suggests four major traditions can
be documented. Appropriate artifact typologies will
, 42 TWENTY-NINTH ANNUAL MEETING
allow recognition of micro-style zones within these
traditions; four are described within one tradition on
the basis of ceramic style variation. (2) The Hope-
well Interaction Sphere describes a yet undefined form
of interaction which served to articulate a number of
localized cultural groups within these and other re-
gional traditions. A complex of raw materials, arti-
fact styles, and modes of burial ceremonialism re-
flects this intercourse in the archaeological record
and served as a basis for definition of the Hope-
wellian phase in the various traditions. To illustrate,
the Hopewellian phase as expressed within the Havana
tradition is defined and its known distribution docu-
mented. (3) Definition of contemporary, non-Hope-
wellian cultural complexes occupying portions of the
Southern Great Lakes-Riverine area is a research ob-
Jective. Examples of such manifestations within the
Havana tradition are suggested. (4) A typology of
Hopewellian manifestations is necessary in terms that
will allow definition of culture type variation within
and between the regional traditions. Mortuary data
provide one basis for demonstrating variation in com-
plexity. This is illustrated through a comparison of
Hopewellian burial sites in western Michigan, south-
ern Ohio, and central Illinois. Hopewellian living
sites yield evidence of differential subsistence-
settlement patterns, another aspect of variation be-
tween cultural systems. Comparison of recently ex-
cavated Hopewellian habitation sites in the Scioto and
Tilinois valleys provide a clear illustration.

examination of regional cultural problems. It seems
Clear that an American Archaic cannot be both age and
Stage. It may be that we shall have to treat the
idea of an American Archaic as a hypothetical-deduc-
tive model. I suggest that the model be marked by
conservatism of culture, close adaptation to regional
ecological systems, potential for either social evo-
lution or devolution, and time spans on the order of

Contributions of Historical Research to
Archaeological Interpretation
Growing interest in historical Indian occupation of
Southeastern Colorado and northeastern New Mexico
(roughly between the Arkansas and Canadian Rivers)
brings to attention the need for an intensive study
of historical references which appear to give evidence
of occupation of archaeological sites. This paper will
endeavor to discuss the problem and to re-examine some
of the tribal occupation boundaries and chronology in
the above-mentioned area during the historical period.
Emphasis will be placed on an understanding of the
use of this region by Apaches, Utes, Comanches, Chey-
ennes, Arapahoes, and Kiowas. Current research on
Ute bands, for example, indicates a year-round oc-

- cupation of a fairly distinct physiographic province
east of the Rocky Mountains contemporaneous with High
Plains Indian groups. This suggests that the tra-
ditional assignment of the Utes mainly to the area
west of the front ranges of the Rockies needs recon-
Sideration, at least for the later historical period.

later historical period some aspects of Mr. Galen

A Monochrome Ceramic Tradition in Peru
The Topara ceramic style of the south-central Peruvian
coast forms the heart of a monochrome tradition which
has its beginnings in the local Chavinoid phases of

reaches its greatest influence at the end of the Early
Horizon, when it is found from the Rimac to the Nazca
valleys as trade ware, local copies, or heavy influ-
ence on the local styles. The tradition is unique
among Peruvian ceramics for the simplicity of decora-
tion and form and stands out from contemporary ceramics
for the high technical quality of the ware.

Value Systems in the Late Archaic
Analysis of burial and midden associations of arti-

that two major classes of items were present: those
without exchange value and those having exchange value
in terms of a larger system. Neither group is thought
to have values expressible in terms of the other, but
the latter group may have internal units representing
a rough value scale. It is suggested that the ex-
ternal and internal values of the latter system derive
from an extensive trading system postulated for the

The concept of a Hopewellian Culture is found to have

interaction sphere permitted more satisfactory inter-
pretation of "Hopewell" on the basis of interacting
regional traditions. But religion was too strongly
emphasized as a unifying element. Rather, the organi-
zation was that of tribal religions with the introduc-
tion of new elements from Mesoamerica resulting in a
certain amount of syncretism. It is explicitly denied,
however, that "Hopewell" is a Mesoamerican Complex.
Finally, it is suggested that the interaction sphere
is the end product of a trade network having its ante-
cedents in the shell-copper trade System appearing
during late Archaic times.

to suggest observations on the rising and setting of

On Puerto Rican Archaeology
Historical sources corroborated by archaeological re-

tated by three cultural traditions. Puerto Rico, be-
cause of its intermediate position between the Greater
Antilles and the Lesser Antilles, is of great impor-
tance in determining the chronology and distribution
of the West Indies aboriginal cultures. Recent Puerto
Rican carbon 14 dates demonstrate that the island was
first populated by a preceramic people who arrived be-
fore the Christian Era. The relation of these aborig-
ines with other preceramic cultures of Venezuela has
been postulated although neither the chronology of the
sites nor their distribution correspond. Other carbon

able information on the prehistoric activities asso-
Ciated with the mound group. Beneath two of the mounds
that were investigated new evidence was found of house
structures that underlay them as well as their asso-
ciated burials and structural features. A new borrow
pit was excavated that now completes the arrangement
of pits outside each of the corners. Work carried out
@long the site of the original embankment clearly in-
dicated that (1) the area had been used as a prehis-
toric dump, and (2) the perimeter had been used to in-
ter burials in the flesh. The presence of dumps in
otherwise sterile areas provides evidence for an im-
portant aspect of Hopewellian behavior. The basis for
a stratigraphic sequence is provided by the materials
in and beneath the embankment and those in the fill of
the adjoining borrow pit.

Plains-Pueblo Archaeology in the Park Plateau
: The use of northeastern New Mexico and southeastern
Colorado is recognized in a general way as a center of
Apache, Ute, Comanche, and Kiowa activities in the
historic period. Even less is known with regards to
the materials and information available on the pre-
historic period. The purpose of this paper is to pre-
sent a chronology of the now known occupational se-
quence, summarize the recovered materials of the Park
Plateau, discuss the problem of the relationships of
this material with that of the Southwest and Plains
provinces, and to present the prevailing archaeological
evidence dealing with the early historic period. Re-
cent salvage archaeology undertaken by the National
Park Service in cooperation with Trinidad State Junior
College along the Upper Purgatoire River in the north-
ern part of the Park Plateau has uncovered new infor-
mation that significantly adds to and alters our under-
standing of the prehistory of this area. Several pos-
Sibilities exist in regard to the origin, development,
and disappearance of the prehistoric cultures that in-
habited the area. Although the topography and environ-
ment are essentially the same from north to south, it
is noted that there are a number of characteristics
which differentiate the occupations of the northern
part of the Plateau from that of the southern part.
The material in this paper dealing with the historic
period includes the archaeological evidence of Apache
and Ute occupations believed to tie in with information
presented by Morris F. Taylor in the following paper.

in 1963. Fort La Tour was a French trading post par-
tially surrounded by a palisade and bastions. Remains
of buildings, fireplaces, and a unique drainage system
of cobblestones were found. Thousands of artifacts, of
French, English, Dutch, Chinese, German, and Swedish
derivation, include pottery, hardware, ornaments, and
glass. tla Coupe Drydock was a quadrangular shaped
earthworks with water gates or aboideaux at opposite
ends to regulate tidal river flow. xCavation revealed
the construction of the aboideaux to be of clay and
brush, with probable wooden gates.

Problems of Determining Aboriginal Sources of

Native Copper in Eastern North America
Accumulated information suggests that it may be possible
to link native copper artifacts with specific deposits
of copper. The principal approach to this problem has
been by analyses for trace elements, but the available
Studies are either so superficial or based on such a
small number of samples that their significance is dif-
ficult to appraise. Recent interpretations range from
rejection of the technique to claims of partial suc-
cess. The present need is for an intensive and systen-
atic investigation of numerous samples of native copper
from each of the various deposits by competent special-
ized investigators.

A Woodland Manifestation in North Central Kansas
In 1962, during the course of salvage operation in the
Norton Reservoir on Prairie Dog Creek, the University
of Nebraska Field School excavated a portion of a Wood-
land site (14Nt11). In comparison to adjacent Wood-
land sites, a large number of stone, bone, and pottery
artifacts were recovered. Some of the stone tools are
identical to those found in Woodland sites; others are
basically like those found in Aksarben sites. The pot-
tery is essentially Woodland in design. The few ker-
nels of corn which were recovered from three distinct,

Nayarit, Mexico
This paper will describe three ceramic kilns dated ca.
1200 A.D. found with their associated wasters by the
author in 1956 as a member of a UCLA expedition to
Coastal Nayarit. The kilns are horizontal pit kilns
measuring about 5" by 3" by 2' and divided in two
Chambers. The large quantity of pottery wasters ex-
cavated (spalls, etc.) indicated a prolonged use of the
kiln structures. Craft specialization indicated by
these finds will be discussed.

Paleoclimatology and the Mill Creek Culture of
Northwest Iowa
During the summer of 1963, limited excavations were
conducted in five Mill Creek middens (130B2, 3 and 4;
135C0K21 and 13PM4). Soil samples were collected for
pollen recovery, soil profiles were checked, and col-
lections of faunal and cultural remains were made.
Particular emphasis was placed on collection of samples
for radiocarbon dating from all occupational levels of
the sites. Precise placement in time was essential
Since the study was designed to test whether a multi-
disciplinary approach would reveal direct evidence of
: the impact of the “Little Climatic Optimum" spanned by
the sites. Results of the dating program and climatic
implications of the study are discussed.

The Archaeology of Grenada
fests in Grenada, supported by the American Philosophi-
cal Society, delineated three major ceramic periods.
The first, 0-700 A.D., was a typical extension of the
Salaloid-Barrancoid tradition of Venezuela. The sec-
ond was represented by burnished, red-painted pottery
with rim points and horns associated with black and
red painted casuelas. A thick, crude ware, Which fre-
quently exhibited deeply scratched surfaces, character-
ized the third. A late phase with finger indented
rims was associated with historic materials. These
ceramic traditions may be correlated with the pre-
Arawak, Arawak, and Carib Indians. Pottery of the sec-
ond is found, I believe, in Cuba and Jamaica but that
of the third not, so far, beyond Antigua. This agrees
with the historic distribution of the Arawaks and
Caribs.

The Tuktu-Naiyuk Site
The locality of the previously described Tuktu at

Preliminary typological comparisons led the senior

plex. The ages of Tuktu and Naiyuk are now discussed
from the evidence of radiocarbon, obsidian, and ser-

Old Bering Sea Types at Point Barrow
Old Bering Sea type artifacts have been reported pre-
viously from the Point Barrow area, but provenance or
identification have frequently been in question. In
| materials excavated by Peabody Museum of Harvard are
items that could fit into OBS assemblages including
harpoon heads that fit OBS typologies and two, from
the Birnirk site, with typical and unmistakable decora-
tions (OBS 3 and Okvik). Contrary to opinion, Birnirk
is not exclusively a single period site. At least four
culture phases are represented. Unfortunately some
subsidiary hypothesis must be advanced to account for

; the OBS items coming from refuse heaps above levels

of later periods.

Cultural Variation in the Selection of Animal

Foods: 4n Ethnozoological Study
A comparison of the animal remains from two archaeo-
logical sites near the Straits of Mackinac in northern
Michigan provides an excellent illustration of the ef-
fect of culture on the selection of animal foods. The
faunal remains from the Juntunen site are typical of
the latest aboriginal adaptation in the Upper Great
Lakes region. This adaptation is contrasted with
those of the French and later the British who occu-
pied nearby Ft. Michilimackinac. In the absence of
marked ecological change through time, differences in
the selection of food animals are related to various
technological socio-political and ideological differ-
ences in these three cultures.

These data are then compared with figures that are
based on modern labor union figures for the different
building trades that would be involved. The purpose
of this comparison is to allow a slightly more exact
figure for man-power estimates than has been made pre-

The Archaic of the Central Atlantic States
The concept of an "archaic" level of cultural develop-
ment in the southeast has evolved rapidly during the
last decade. Only a few years ago there was consider-
able reluctance to concede a preceramic period for the
area. Later there was equal reluctance to accept sub-
stantial antiquity for many non-ceramic cultures that
could be identified. Today, it appears that there
were some “archaic” cultures that were co-existent
with some paleo-indian culture in the southeast. There
is no longer reasonable doubt that the concept "archaic"
covers a long period of time and that it must be de-
fined in terms of content as well as time.

competence, ranging from historians and anthropologists
who have acquired archaeological competence in addition
to their academic foundation to a few sheer frauds.
Presently, federal, state, and local agencies are call-
ing increasingly for competent specialists to investi-
gate and conserve historical sites. This is also true
of private investors for houses or buildings known or
alleged to be of historical or architectural merit.
Neither departments of history or anthropology in Ameri-
can universities have hastened to provide course work
aimed at training those who wish to specialize in his-
torical sites investigations as archaeologists. The
first United States university to do so was the Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania, and the course was offered in the
Graduate School of Arts and Sciences by the Department
of American Civilization. Two other universities now
have related courses. Problems related to this spe-
ciality are being defined; meanwhile the student is
largely on his own.

The Ceramic Sequence at Tikal, Guatemala
The basic outline of the Tikal ceramic sequence has
been completed. The sequence consists of 12 ceramic
complexes; 5 Preclassic, 2 Early Classic, 5 Late Clas-
sic, and 2 Postclassic. Since many of the Tikal conm-
plexes show great similarity to the already well known
Uaxactun sequence, this paper will stress parts of the
sequence in which the Tikal data adds new information
which was not available at Uaxactun. Particular en-
phasis will be given to the subdivisions of the Pre-
Classic, and to the nature of the ceramic transitions
between Preclassic and Early Classic and between Farly
Classic and Late Classic.

: Anasazi Mobility and Mesa Verde "Migrations"
Three summers of field reconnaissance under the aus-
pices of Wetherill Mesa Laboratory have brought in new
information on the instability of primitive agricul-
tural communities in the Southwest. (1) Continual,
small-scale population shifts were characteristic of
Anasezi culture. (2) There is both ethnographic and
archaeological evidence for this semi-sedentary way of
life. (3) At times the drifts assumed a directional-
ity and magnitude which merit the term "migrations."
(45 Ethnographic and archaeological data suggest that
people moved about as rather small groups: by ex-
tended families or clans rather than as villages in a
solid phalanx. (5) Using pottery styles as clues, it
is possible to track movements of Tusayan people into
the San Juan area and of San Juan peoples toward the
south and the Rio Grande. (6) "Chacoan” and "Mesa
Verde" are styles rather than places, and the latter
succeeded the former in a host of different villages.
(7) The constant mobility kept Anasazi culture rela-
tively homogenized. (8) Most moves were set in mo-
tion by pressures, not catastrophes.

The Use of Native Mesoamerican Medicinal Documents
for the Historical Reconstruction of Therapeutics
For the most part, the documentary materials concerning
medicinal plants and other divinational practices have
been neglected or have not been useful to the students
of this newer discipline--that of Prehistoric Medicine.
, ABSTRACTS OF PAPERS 15
Many pages of most every early manuscript dealing with
Mesoamerica are devoted to the symptoms and cures of
diseases. Some entire manuscripts deal with astronony,

; chronology, medicine, or a combination of these. Until
now, chronology has been the principal field of re-
search and study. For the past several years, more in-
terest has been expressed in this field of medicine.

: From the documentary sources and the usage of certain
symbolism (i.e. monumental inscriptions, figurines,
and associated paraphernalia) it is possible to trace
some of the medicinal remedies (recipes) and their
plant-sources back through the history of the early
cultures of Mesoamerica. Thus the type of treatment
for a given disease or illness will show a temporal
and spacial distribution. It will be shown through ex-
amples how this material can be used for reconstruct-
ing the cultural usages of therapeutics.

Death's Heads, Cherubs, and Willow Trees: Experi-

mental Archaeology in Colonial Cemeteries
Seventeenth and eighteenth century gravestones in
Massachusetts are decorated with a traditional set of
designs which have distinctive spatial and temporal
limits. By treating them as archaeclogical phenomena,
one can demonstrate and test methods of inferring dif-
fusion, design evolution, and relationships between a
folk art tradition and the culture which produced it.
Early popularity of skulls reflects Puritan attitudes
toward death, while the later cherubs and willow and
urn motifs indicate the breakdown of these values.
Although cherubs appear earliest among an innovating
urban class in Boston-Cambridge, they remain minor in
this central area, but are rapidly adopted in out-
lying districts, further removed from the center of

; influence. Imperfect reproduction of certain designs
give rise to distinctive local styles of other areas.
